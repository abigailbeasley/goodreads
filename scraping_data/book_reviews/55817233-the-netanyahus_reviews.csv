Cohen is a brilliant, funny writer, and that shines through."
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11828431-murray,Rating 4 out of 5,"audiobook version üìï The Netanyahus won the 2022 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. The Pulitzer citation for the novel described it as, ‚ÄúA mordant, linguistically deft historical novel about the ambiguities of the Jewish-American experience, presenting ideas and disputes as volatile as its tightly-wound plot.""So, here's the thing - the story really happened and it happened to Harold Bloom, famous literary critic and Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale, and his wife. It was they upon whom the Netanyahu family of five descended circa 1960 - mother and father and three boys named Yonatan, Benjamin (Bibi), and Iddo. And they were hell on wheels - the sort of people who are always right and indeed always righteous, who can do no wrong, and if something does go wrong, it's other people's fault and other people's kids' fault, always. Know anyone like that?Humor runs throughout the novel, but is more dominant in the first 60% to 70% of the book. The academia portions can be light or dark, depending. If Benzion Netanyahu is involved, the current Israeli PM's father, it is dark and narcissistic indeed.Believing all others fools and imbeciles, and that he is persecuted and misunderstood, Benzion is seeking a faculty position at the narrator's college. A lot of Jewish history comes into this part of the story, but in his lectures, Benzion's main thrust is less academic than political - Jewscannot assimilate, history has shown they are rejected wherever they go; in truth, they have no history, just a mythology; so the only option is to carve out and defend a homeland, namely Israel. Benzion has a polemic far more than he has a thesis. (His actual books are available on Amazon, for instance, his Founding Fathers of Zionism.)The behavior of the Netanyahus on campus, and in what we now know was Harold Bloom's home, was so over the top, the reader is stunned. It is crazy. It is laughable. It is insane. And the middle son produced from this chutzpah is now serving his fourth term as PM of a significant country in the Middle East, a country where Palestinians are still refused statehood and basically live out their lives in one large refugee camp. Which Benzion's son does nothing to alleviate. ""Bibi, melek Yisrael!‚Äù his followers chant - ‚ÄúBibi, king of Israel!‚Äù This is actually lifted from a children's song about King David. It sounds a lot like a certain dynamic in another country across the sea from Israel and the West Bank.üìö Will you like it? It IS funny, it IS wild, it IS entertaining. But it also requires the reader to put a lot of thought in. I wouldn't call the novel lightweight by any means. I found the history theses and academic debates fascinating, but I'm used to it. Others may or may not find it intriguing. There‚Äôs certainly black humor and satire there, even slapstick, that the reader would not want to miss. And then there‚Äôs the fun sound effects and even funnier music (audio version of course). üèØBut what an unbelievable story."
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2386804-mj-nicholls,Rating 4 out of 5,"When Cohen published the pathologically unreadable 800-page monolith Witz in 2010 with Dalkey Archive, a flabbergasting slurry of manic logorrhoea intermittently brilliant and excruciating, there was no indication as to how Cohen might harness his astonishing stamina for further high-voltage literary wowness. The answer was Book of Numbers, a violently readable novel that shirked thickets of opaque wtf in favour of turbulent meta-antics, formal play and punnilingual wizardry, and established him as the heir apparent to David Foster Wallace.Continuing the downsizing present in his last novel Moving Kings, Cohen serves up a compellingly odd campus tale taken from an anecdotal story as relayed to the author by critic Harold Bloom. In the late 1950s, Hebrew scholar Ben-Zion Netanyahu (father of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) visits the college of Corbindale to hold a polemical lecture on the Iberian Inquisition. Something of an affectionate tribute to Bloom, who is recast as the mild-mannered Ruben, outgunned by a chiding wife and a rebellious daughter, the novel serves up a stylish evocation of the period. The humour is occasionally reliant on pratfalls and overly long passages of domestic repartee, though on a prose level, The Netanyahus is as sublimely written a novel as anything you‚Äôre likely to read this year."

Perch√© ‚Äì e ancora devo capirne la ragione - il fatto che quella che normalmente √® una storia di finzione ‚Äì e proprio per questa ci cattura e avvince ‚Äì si rafforza se la finzione √® basata su una realt√† esistita o esistente. Una storia vera.In ogni caso, la storia vera che sta dietro, o alla base, di questo romanzo, √® che Harold Bloom ‚Äì s√¨, proprio lui, quell‚ÄôHarold Bloom alquanto celebre ‚Äì qualche anno fa ha invitato Joshua Cohen a fargli visita perch√© voleva conoscerlo e complimentarsi per il suo precedente Il libro dei numeri, e fra una chiacchiera e l‚Äôaltra gli ha raccontato di quando insegnava a Yale ‚Äì universit√† ben pi√π prestigiosa della Corbin della finzione letteraria ‚Äì e gli tocc√≤ fare da chaperon a quel Netanyahu che √® probabilmente diventato celebre solo per avere dato i natali all‚Äôorrido Benjamin detto Bibi, pi√π volte primo ministro d‚ÄôIsraele (√® dal 1996 che flagella quel paese, nonostante le accuse di corruzione e frode e abuso d‚Äôufficio, e nonostante un buon numero di nefaste scelte √® il pi√π longevo capo di Stato d‚ÄôIsraele). Bibi nel romanzo ‚Äì e nella realt√† ‚Äì √® il figlio numero due, all‚Äôepoca decenne, di quell‚Äôoscuro professore Netanyahu.E cos√¨ Harold Bloom diventa Ruben Blum, io-narrante di tutta la storia, professore ebreo al suo secondo anno alla piccola universit√† Corbin - e quindi ancora nel periodo di prova ‚Äì dove insegna storia della tassazione (üòÖ): nella sua veste di professore in prova, che dunque non pu√≤ rifiutarsi, e in qualit√† di ebreo, viene scelto per accompagnare il professor Netanyahu in visita: tanto tra voi ebrei vi capite, no? Visita che Netanyahu padre spera si traduca in lavoro, in una cattedra di insegnamento di storia medioevale della penisola iberica. Netanyahu padre √® uno storico che si sente in missione per conto di Dio - proprio come i famigerati Blues Brothers - ma pi√π precisamente per conto del popolo ebraico, dalle credenziali accademiche controverse, basate pi√π sull‚Äôideologia che su fatti o ricerche o pubblicazioni.Al di l√† del gustosissimo e godibilissimo aneddoto, c‚Äô√® come un incontro-scontro-confronto tra modi diversi di essere ebrei: che forse si traduce anche in generazioni diverse d‚Äôebrei.Il professore Netanyahu √® l‚Äôebraismo che a quell‚Äôepoca era forse ancora minoritario - ma in terra d‚ÄôIsraele destinato a diventare maggioritario, che con quello all‚Äôepoca maggioritario condivideva l‚Äôaggressivit√†, ma non l‚Äôossessione persecutoria - figlio del Sionismo revisionista, quello di destra, quello del Likud di cui suo figlio Bibi diventer√† il faraone. Il professore Netanyahu vive in perenne stato di precariet√† esistenziale, con l‚Äôincubo dell‚Äôannientamento, del pogrom, della Shoah.Blum-Bloom √® della generazione di Philip Roth, di Joseph Heller, e pur avendo dieci anni di meno, la generazione presumo sia la stessa di quella di Saul Bellow e Bernard Malamud e Chaim Potok: una generazione che √® entrata a fare parte della cultura americana partendo da una posizione di outsider, quando gli ebrei erano ancora un gruppo socialmente distinto, e respinto, con codici culturali e linguistici altri, un piede a New York e l‚Äôaltro ancorato in uno shtetl dell‚ÄôEuropa orientale. E quindi si comprende lo spaesamento di Blum, accademico rispettato, ma ancora guardato dai suoi colleghi con paternalismo quando non sfacciatamente dall‚Äôalto in basso: un uomo in prova, che vive con perenne senso di precariet√† sociale, con la paura di essere di nuovo rinchiuso nel ghetto.E poi c‚Äô√® un terzo livello dell‚Äôessere ebreo: ebreo in America oggi, come Joshua Cohen, in contrapposizione al suo io-narrante Blum. Oggi perfettamente integrati, e addirittura in alcuni campi, come la letteratura e il cinema, a fare scuola. Mentre nel 1959-60 gli ebrei cominciavano a non essere pi√π, o prevalentemente non pi√π, relegati ai margini della societ√† ma non erano ancora pienamente accettati dalla casta e neppure dall‚Äôintellighenzia:Per la mia generazione ‚Äì dice Blum ‚Äì un ebreo era fortunato a essere scambiato per bianco [...] per qualsiasi minoranza lo stile e anche la forma di protezione pi√π affidabile era assimilarsi, non differenziarsi.Certo, il fatto che I Netanyahu faccia esplicito e diretto riferimento a Bibi aggiunge pepe. Spezia che aumenta perch√© Bibi, coi suoi dieci anni, √® in scena, √® uno dei tre selvaggi bambini Netanyahu, capaci delle pi√π grossolane mancanze di educazione.Ma quello che per me ha reso il libro una lettura oltremodo piacevole √® il tono adottato da Cohen: divertente, buffo, comico, esilarante, in certi momenti spinto fin quasi alla farsa, sempre deliziosa. Momenti impagabili a volont√†, in pratica ogni pagina, in pratica pi√π volte in ogni pagina. Su tutti, per me, il dialogo tra la suocera che si diletta di psicologia e l‚Äôio-narrante. Cohen cita Philip Roth, e fa bene, cita Woody Allen, e fa bene: ma si ritaglia un suo spazio netto e preciso. In pratica, come incrociare argomenti di ‚Äúpeso‚Äù con leggerezza di scrittura e umorismo (in questo caso, quello ebraico, il ‚Äúwitz‚Äù): in pratica, una commedia sofisticata. 4,5Sinagoga di Trieste, novembre 2022.Sinagoga di Trieste, ottobre 1941."

5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3250759-paul-fulcher,Rating 2 out of 5,"Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for FictionFinalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction.Joshua Cohen‚Äôs latest novel, The Nethanyahus is subtitled ‚ÄúAn Account of A Minor and Ultimately Even Negligible Episode in the History of a Very Famous Family.‚ÄùIt is an odd - and to me uneasy - mixture of campus novel, non-fictional exposition and a rather odd attack on famous real-life family by creating a fictional version of them to ridicule.The author explains in the afterword it is inspired by a true story told to him by the critic Harold Bloom from his time at Cornell. In the novel, the narrator is Ruben Blum, a professor in the history of taxation at the fictitious University of Corbindale in upstate New York. Although he is keen to emphasise that Blum - who by his own admission is the ""dread-fuelled embodiment of the under-coordinated overintellectualizing self-depreciating male Jewish stereotype"" of Woody Allen and Philip Roth's work - is not intended as a portrayal of Bloom.Blum's account begins:My name is Ruben Blum and I‚Äôm an, yes, an historian. Soon enough, though, I guess I‚Äôll be historical. By which I mean I‚Äôll die and become history myself, in a rare type of transformation traditionally reserved for the purer scholars. Lawyers die and don‚Äôt become the law, doctors die and don‚Äôt turn into medicine, but biology and chemistry professors pass away and decompose into biology and chemistry, they mineralize into geology, they disperse into their science, just as surely as mathematicians become statistics. The same process holds true for us historians‚Äîin my experience, we‚Äôre the only ones in the humanities for whom this holds true‚Äîthe only ones who become what we study; we age, we yellow, we go wrinkled and brittle along with our materials until our lives subside into the past, to become the very substance of time. Or maybe that‚Äôs just the Jew in me talking... Goys believe in the Word becoming Flesh, but Jews believe in the Flesh becoming Word, a more natural, rational incarnation‚Ä¶By way of further introduction, I will now quote a remark made to me by the who-shall-remain-nameless then-president of the American Historical Association, when I met him at a symposium back in my student days just after the Second World War: ‚ÄúAh,‚Äù he said, limply pressing my hand, ‚ÄúBlum, did you say? A Jewish historian?‚ÄùThough the man surely intended this remark to wound me, it merely succeeded in bringing delight, and even now I find I can smile at the description. I appreciate its accidental imprecision, and the way the double entendre can function as a type of psychological test:‚Äú‚ÄòA Jewish historian‚Äô‚Äîwhen you hear that, what do you think? What image springs to mind?‚Äù The point is, the epithet as applied is both correct and incorrect. I am a Jewish historian, but I am not an historian of the Jews‚Äîor I‚Äôve never been one, professionally.This last a key point to the plot - as the University is recruiting and Blum is asked to vet one the frontrunning candidate, a specialist in the Spanish Inquisition, one Benzion Nethanyahu, largely on the grounds that they are both Jewish.And ‚ÄòBenzion Nethanyahu‚Äô, by contrast to Blum, is very much meant to be a portrayal of the real-life figure of the same name: academically author of the 1,400 page The Origins of the Inquisition in Fifteenth Century Spain (which, to simplify it to a few words, argues the Iberian Inquisition was driven not by a desire to root out heresy but rather by racial anti-Semitism, tracing a direct path to the Holocaust), politically a leading Revisionist Zionist and close ally of Ze'ev Jabotinsky, and biologically the father of the current Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (who features in the book as a child).To be fair the novel allows Benzion Nethanyahu to express his views, even if one strongly suspects the author strongly disagrees with them. But it counterbalances this by making him, his wife and their three children figures of fun, Benzion something of a crackpot, his wife rude and presumptive and the children wild - Blum calls them the 'Yahus.' For example when we first meet the family, the 7 year old Iddo is still wearing a nappy, when it is removed the 10 year-old Benjamin toys with Iddo's genitals, and the 13 year old Jonathan (who in real-life was later the sole Israeli casualty of Operation Entebbe) has sex with the Blum's daughter.The novel has had rave reviews in the UK press in both the FT (https://www.ft.com/content/873e1070-d...) and The Times (https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/49...). They describe the review as ‚Äúvery funny‚Äù and ‚Äúlaugh-out-loud funny‚Äù, whereas I can‚Äôt say I found any amusement in the pages at all.Disappointing - 1.5 stars rounded to 2."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8051792-lisa-ny,Rating 4 out of 5,"[4+] I like this bizarre novel about the Blum family in 1959 upstate New York who host the out-of-control Netanyahus for an evening. The novel is an engaging blend of family life, humor, slapstick drama, academic politics and medieval Jewish history. Even the audiobook, which contains sound effects like running water and slamming doors, is odd. I am glad I went into the book blind because the afterword is a delightful surprise. (My son was a student of Harold Bloom and I am fascinated by him.) This book is certainly an unusual choice for the Pulitzer as it will appeal to a fairly narrow group of readers - but I am one of them!"
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5942822-alan,Rating 5 out of 5,"‚ÄúEliminate the Diaspora or the Diaspora will eliminate you.‚ÄùSo goes the opening quote of Joshua Cohen‚Äôs Pulitzer winner, The Netanyahus. Throughout the book, this tension remains. For me, that‚Äôs the strength of the novel - I‚Äôm in awe of how Cohen has managed to capture the weight of social expectation between minorities in an ‚Äúexpatriate‚Äù situation. Obviously, the American-Jewish and Israeli relations are not the same as those between, say, two Swedes abroad. There are cultural scripts. There are 1960‚Äôs norms. There are microaggressions to traverse. There are big M macroaggressions to traverse. But that‚Äôs the beauty and the heart of this novel, the main question: flourish and feed the increasingly separate life of the individual, or ‚Äúfeed into‚Äù and ‚Äúsupport‚Äù diaspora relations? I have felt this before, continue to feel this, and it‚Äôs not too much of a surprise that I see this to be the main machine behind the forward momentum of the book. For others, this is not the case. A quick look around at articles and reviews for this book shows that people are chomping at the bit to compare this novel to Roth, to Bellow, to Malamud, all in a pejorative manner. That is, quite honestly, insanely lazy. That‚Äôs the best you can do? This is not to say I haven‚Äôt done it - god knows I‚Äôm lazy. But I guess when I do it, I feel shame, at the very least. Presumably these are individuals with MFAs and a variety of other literature- and writing-related degrees. You‚Äôre just comparing him to Roth and calling it a day? Nathan Goldman does it in his Jewish Currents article called ‚ÄúThat Joke Isn‚Äôt Funny Anymore‚Äù. At first, there is his weird insistence of saying that Ruben Blum is Harold Bloom (Cohen has explicitly mentioned, countless times and across multiple interviews, that this is not the case - it may have started that way, but grew into a completely different character with time and necessary modifications). But then there are successive comments about Cohen‚Äôs work being worse than other Jewish-Americans. For instance: ‚ÄúThe homage to the Jewish American canon dictates the novel‚Äôs entire form, turning The Netanyahus into a midcentury pastiche‚Äîa Jewish campus novel animated by Rothian hijinks and brief bursts of Bellowish lyricism.‚Äù I can‚Äôt quite disagree, as I have read 1 Bellow and 4 Roths, but I want to. This had its own peaks and they were as good, if not better, than Roth‚Äôs. It also seems as though Cohen‚Äôs not-too-polite fictionalization of the real Netanyahu family did not sit well with many. I don‚Äôt know anything about the politics, but that seems to be criticism levelled at a specific portion of the contents, as opposed to Cohen‚Äôs ability to write a novel as well as Roth or Bellow or Malamud. Later on in the very same article, Goldman says: ‚ÄúBy subsuming the Netanyahus into the paradigmatic, phallic folly of American Jewish fiction, the novel effectively transforms them into diaspora Jews, understood as a literary production of the diasporic imagination.‚Äù If that‚Äôs the real issue, fair enough. I don‚Äôt know enough to have an opinion.But it‚Äôs not entirely as though Cohen is ‚Äúunaware‚Äù of the effect that Roth has had on his writing. In other words, a pejorative comparison to Roth isn‚Äôt the insult that these critics think that it is. After the passing of Roth, Cohen wrote a dedication/obituary/tribute in The New Republic, called ‚ÄúThe Cult of Philip Roth‚Äù. In it, he said:‚ÄúRoth, to me, was the True Judge. His literature exerted that authority: What he wrote, I accepted; I swallowed. Even his most outlandish fictions, I subscribed and assented to. I felt I had no choice. His writing had the style of a verdict, an edict. His sentences, with their total and carefully claused control, came down to me from the mountain‚Äîor from the high shelves of the library of the Hebrew Academy of Atlantic County, New Jersey‚Äîlike commandments cut into stone, and as the descriptions accumulated, as the arguments and counter-arguments piled up, and the appetites were embraced and disavowed with equal fervor, all I could do was submit, surrender, and give myself up completely to his power.‚ÄùHe also said:‚ÄúEvery immigrant American writer of every ethnicity, race and, yes, gender, who followed in his wake‚Äîwhether they acknowledge it or not, whether they like acknowledging it or not‚Äîis in his debt. Sure, other writers had tried this transubstantiation trick before‚Äînotably Bellow, whom Roth idolized, and that other Roth, Henry‚Äîbut only Philip Roth attempted it so explicitly, and yet, paradoxically, so casually, in book after book after book (almost 30 novels in all), as if by sheer effort he could drag not just the Old World into the New World, but the New World into the Global.‚ÄùAnd let‚Äôs not forget that he wrote an entire review of Roth‚Äôs biography for Harper‚Äôs Magazine, titled ‚ÄúThe Possessed‚Äù, as Roth.But whatever. The lazy negative reviews aside, I‚Äôll move forward toward the end of my equally lazy positive review. I adored the humour, the effortless prose, the references that made me feel more intelligent than I am, and the digressions from traditional fiction prose style (isn‚Äôt it hilarious? A week or so ago, I said this was a negative for Graham Greene - I am just making it up as I go, it seems).I want to start slowing down by referring to the author‚Äôs Paris Review interview with Martin Riker. The interviewer says:‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm also saying I did not find much darkness in this book. But maybe what I should be saying is that I find darkness around the book, inescapably, in the looming shadow of the real-life future‚Äîthe political rise of Benjamin Netanyahu and all that has meant for the world‚Äîthat readers of Blum‚Äôs tale can‚Äôt help but hold in mind. The book‚Äôs title suggests it is about current events, but really, current events are the book‚Äôs unspoken truth. In this particular sense I might put The Netanyahus in a lineage with Georges Perec‚Äôs W or W.‚ÄâG. Sebald‚Äôs novels, books with absent centers, dark jokes for which history provides the punch line.‚ÄùCohen‚Äôs response is interesting to me. It is self-serving and masturbatory for sure - no getting around that. But it does sum up what I feel about a lot of great literature that I read:‚ÄúThat‚Äôs extremely generous because I know how much Perec means to you. I‚Äôm a student of his, too‚Äîinterested if not in the strictly Oulipian nature of some of the work then in his principle of writing through lacunae, of purposefully excluding something from a book that might ultimately provide its key. These books tend to be tests, of the reader as much as of the culture itself‚Äîtests as to whether a culture has preserved within itself enough of what Van Wyck Brooks called ‚Äúa usable past,‚Äù to enable the book‚Äôs comprehension. If you had only the most superficial idea of Nazi aesthetics‚Äîif you knew nothing at all of its cult of physicality‚Äîwould you be able to understand W? If you knew nothing about German writing outside of Germany‚Äîin Austria, in Austria-Hungary, at the fringes of the German-speaking world‚Äîhow could you hope to get at what Sebald is trying for, the assertion of an alternative German canon in the wake of et cetera? Their novels become trials of historical consciousness‚Äîdo you remember enough to understand them?‚Äîas much as of present-day consciousness‚Äîdo you see and hear the world around you clearly enough to make any connections between the world and the page? Books that omit context or explanation, books that refrain from acknowledging their analogies and allegories, books that withhold from the reader not in a spirit of exclusion but as a spiritual catalyst, books that, yes, summon up the cherub to cover their intentions‚Äîthese are the books that provoke the reader, or at least provoke me as a reader, into seeking out the sources that are being denied, and in the process of that seeking I find myself situated within and vital to myriad continua. Or, to put it another way, this is how tradition works. This is what it means to live in a culture. Our books should be missing something, the finding of which makes us whole.‚ÄùI will end with a couple of quotes I liked from the book:‚ÄúTo this day, the transmogrification of ancient feuds remains the primary process by which immigrants nativize: to renew a conflict is to acculturate.‚Äù‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm trying to say, Ruben, is that meeting this horrible man and his horrible wife, it made me realize something. It made me realize I don‚Äôt believe in anything anymore and not just that, but I don‚Äôt care. I have no beliefs and I‚Äôm OK with it; I‚Äôm more than OK, I‚Äôm glad‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm getting older without convictions‚Ä¶‚Äù"
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57003346-matthew-ted,Rating 5 out of 5,"107th book of 2023.2nd reading. This is still one of the most wickedly smart novels I've read that's been published in the last few years, maybe decade. Every single intellectual I've thrown this at has returned to me, gleeful. The humour, which make no mistake, is on nearly every single page of the novel, operates at a sort of postmodern high - there's a rich satirical flare spliced with an almost slapstick happenings. The passages on history and Jewishness aren't far off being painfully intelligent. It's a writer's novel, the sort of thing you wish you were smart enough to write. Cohen says he hates campus novels and hates historical novels. In his research, reading campus novels, he barely finished a single one (if you were to name a retirement home for Yiddish writers, you'd call it David Lodge). Someone, incredulous, asked him, 'Stoner?' to which he replied, 'Yeah' [pause] 'It was nice.' I'm bitter about that, I'll admit. Campus novels have always done it for me. Unlike Cohen, I love campuses. Anyway. This is brilliant, a true accomplishment and an astounding league above this year's joint-winner, Demon Copperhead, which against this novel, I almost feel embarrassed for Kingsolver. ____________________________42nd book of 2021. Artist for this review is photographer Jonathan Brand.It's blowing a hooley outside tonight. Over the last few years (this is unrelated to the hooley) I've mostly avoided reading new contemporary fiction, mostly because I never think it's any good. This year I've been trying slightly harder, and with mixed results. I've read some fairly mediocre novels like Real Life, Writers & Lovers, The Vegetarian, etc. I mostly say unsavory things of new literary fiction, which never seems to be very interesting or very original. I'm probably reading the wrong things, in fact, I clearly am. Anyway, the search is over and if literary fiction steers itself into Cohen's wry waters, then I would finally accept that the novel is bucking over some promising waves. The Netanyahus is officially published tomorrow, 4th May. It is described by the blurb as ""mixing fiction with non-fiction, the campus novel with the lecture, The Netanyahus is a wildly inventive, genre-bending comedy of blending, identity, and politics."" At times, it felt almost like a Jewish Pnin to me. Ruben Blum, a Jewish historian, but as he distinguishes, not ""an historian of the Jews"", is on Corbin College's committee to review the application of an exiled Israeli scholar, Benzion Netanyahu. 1959-1960 New York, because they are both Jews, the College presumed it would be necessary, even obvious, that Blum help with deciding a fellow Jew's fate. The expected sort of lines are used, ""One of your kind"", so along such lines. Netanyahu stays distant from the semi-abstract narrative at first. Cohen breaks down Jewish life in New York. Blum, his wife and his daughter try to live comfortable lives. Judy, the daughter, despises her nose, which causes her to snore loudly and profusely drip snot. There are several attempts (one very shocking) at changing the shape, reducing it, or simply damaging it beyond repair in an act of self-destruction, to lead to reconstruction. Once Netanyahu and his family arrive however, the true narrative kicks off and the pages move faster.It is a comic novel, wildly dry and intelligent, wicked, almost. Cohen's wit drips from every line of prose and carries the novel. He's a fantastic writer, and I read that Granta named him one of America's greatest young writers of today. I think it's a fair claim. I recently read Bellow's Paris Review interview (Bellow, with Roth, being one of the writers who frequently appears in any discussion of Jewish literature) where he says, ""He [a professor of Bellow's] said the subject was much too serious for fooling. I felt that my fooling was fairly serious."" This struck me as oddly profound when I read it the other week and as I was reading Cohen's novel, it kept lingering: I felt as if Cohen's fooling here was fairly serious. There are some wonderful lectures involved in the novel about Jewish history, about religion, about Europe. At one point, in the interview itself:
""I know the Jews are the chosen people, Dr. Netanyahu, but why choose them for this? What makes them the best vehicle, as you say, for such an undertaking?""""Because of all the peoples in the world, none is less historical, or less historically minded. Which is curious, given Judaism's antiquity. As Dr. Blum can surely confirm for you, it's a common enough quip among contemporary American Jews that Jewish parents would rather their children become pediatricians or litigators than, say, the messiah. But I would submit that even messianism, even false messianism, is more Jewish a discipline than history, whose allegiance to sublunary powers such as regents and facts was traditionally regarded by the rabbis as idolatry.""
And Cohen balances the lecture, the seriousness (seriousness that still reads with this sly humour), with scenes of great comic effect. 
""Forget just in this weather, also in summer. And you only know you left when you get to Allentown. Wilkes something, like the man who shot Lincoln.""""Wilkes-Barre,"" I said.""No, that's not it.""Jonathan, sleeve-wiping cocoa beads from his sparse Puerto Rican moustache hairs, said, ""Wilkes Booth.""""Yes, Wilkes Booth.""""Wilkes-Barre,"" I said, ""near Scranton.""Jonathan said, ""The actor John Wilkes Booth shooted, shot President Avraham Lincoln, the sixteenth president of the United States who gave to the slaves their freedom in 1865 at the end of the American Civil War.""
Really, I could type out whole portions of dialogue and whole scenes of humorous events. The novel is very fairly serious in its fooling. Anyway, bravo to Cohen. This is probably the best ""new"" novel I've read in some time. I want to discuss the back pages of the book to end. The novel is dedicated, I noticed (surprised) on starting, to Harold Bloom. I wondered why. At the back of the novel is Cohen's ""Credits and Extra Credit""; I read it with great interest and for the final punchline in this wonderful and strange novel. It turns out, Cohen got to know the late Bloom in the last years of his life and would visit him. Bloom would ask Cohen about what was being published in the world and if it was any good. All the while, Cohen admitted to trying to steer the conversation onto Bloom's own views, which he wanted to hear from the horse's mouth. He got some fantastic things from Bloom: a car crash he'd [Bloom] gotten into with Paul de Man, that he had argued with Anthony Burgess about limbo and purgatory (""as a lapsed Catholic, Burgess was going to hell, whereas I am still here and going nowhere""), that Bloom played chess with Nabokov (""it astonished no one that I did not emerge the winner""), that Cormac McCarthy would call Bloom on the telephone ""while soaking like a cowboy in the bath"", and that Bloom thought W.G. Sebald was ""gentle, maybe too gentle."". I am including these purely because they are beautiful to know (I think) and want to record them. But the point eventually comes down to the fact that Bloom told Cohen of a time he was asked to coordinate the campus visit of an obscure Israeli historian named Ben-Zion Netanyahu, who showed up for a job interview and lecture with his wife and three children in tow and proceeded to make a mess. (This works as a fairly apt blurb to the novel, funnily enough.) Cohen says it was one of the last stories Bloom told him before his death in 2019; later, he went about writing it as a novel, with many inventions from his own imagination to fill in the gaps Bloom left out (quite a few, it seems). Long story short: Cohen tried to contact a certain somebody who ""features"" in the novel, to ask for their consent to being involved, though mostly ""unrecognisable"". No answer the first time so Cohen went ahead and wrote the novel anyway. He then sent the finished draft to her for one final attempt and the book ends with her reply in verbatim. Its inclusion to end the book feels like the last punchline, in a way, the last laugh at the hilarity of the world and his fairly serious fooling:
Dear Joshua Cohen,I've just finished reading your 'book', and I'm going to say it once and for all and that's it: Judaism is just another word for THE PATRIARCHY (and for PATRIARCIAL HEGEMONY). We're all one people, the Human People, with no differences between us. The planet is ruined, the machines are taking over, and none of this Jewish crap still matters. WAKE UP!!!!!! No one reads books anymore and the Jews are either on the wrong side of history or just irrelevant. IF YOU'RE HAVING AN IDENTITY CRISIS, I'm sorry, your only choice is to expand your consciousness and join the Human People in our common struggle against pollution and technology or spend the rest of your life crying for a past that let's be honest couldn't have been that great if this is where it leads. Everything you believe in never existed, including your individual self, if you ever believed you could change that. Admit it, even literacy is dying‚Äîand when the last old Jew of you is finally as dead as (((God))) this proud nonbinary dyke YES DYKE IS GOING TO DANCE NAKED AS HELL ON HIS GRAVE.

10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56145680-ari-levine,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 stars, rounded slightly down. A superb blend of crude farce and political satire, laying bare the cultural divides on either side of the Jewish diaspora, between assimilated American Jews and battle-hardened Israelis. Cohen also painfully probes the deep psychic scars borne by professorial mediocrities and scholarly pedants who populate academia (not to mention their wives and families). Beyond Cohen's two hilarious parodies of tendentious recommendation letters and epic-fail job talks, this is much more than an academic roman √† clef, and positions him as the heir to a long lineage of Jewish-American Men of Letters: Bellow, Malamud, Roth. The novel bears the ponderous and knowingly ridiculous subtitle An Account Of A Minor And Ultimately Even Negligible Episode In The History Of A Very Famous Family. Cohen has very loosely fictionalized the literary scholar Harold Bloom's first-person story about the ill-fated campus visit to Cornell of the Israeli historian Ben-Zion Netanyahu, who dragged his (uninvited) wife and three sons with him to invade Bloom's house for a weekend. The elder Netanyahu was a revisionist Zionist political activist who spent his working life as a journeyman academic in America, slaving away on a massive tome about the Jews in the Spanish Inquisition. But of course, he was more famous for his progeny, as the father of Yonatan (Yoni) and Benjamin (Bibi) Netanyahu: respectively, the martyred hero of Entebbe and the long-serving and recently-deposed Likudnik prime minister of Israel. Our narrator, Ruben Blum (who is totally not a stand-in for Harold Bloom, okay?), is looking back upon his early career as a young and untenured American history professor at the fictional Corbin University (a stand-in for Cornell) in the early 1960s. Born in the Bronx to working-class Eastern European parents but married to Edith, a wealthy German Jew from the Upper East Side of Manhattan, Ruben is negotiating the boundaries of assimilation and seeking upward mobility into the professorial bourgeoisie at a time when strict quotas limited the number of Jews in the Ivy League. Ruben's the only Jew in his workplace, making him the recipient of unending anti-Semitic microaggressions from his WASPy department chair and dull colleagues. The Blums are the only Jews in their snowy upstate New York town, ingratiatingly attempting to fit into the American mainstream of Christmas parties, TV dinners, and TV Westerns, while their teenage daughter Judith is desperately begging her parents for a rhinoplasty to blend in with the gentiles at high school.With typical tokenism, Blum has been drafted to host his co-religionist Netanyahu, whom he's assured will be arriving alone to interview for a position at Corbin. Cringeworthy and disgusting hi-jinks ensue when the entire family (whom Blum mockingly deems The Yahus, sotto voce) suddenly shows up in a crowded and broken-down old Ford station wagon in the midst of a January snowstorm. The situation gradually escalates into total slapstick anarchy (Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf-style) as the wives engage in passive-aggressive emotional warfare, the bottomless martinis flow, and the ferally aggressive Netanyahu boys (one of whom is a diaper-wearing 7-year-old) destroy Chez Blum and threaten Judith's chastity, while Blum witnesses Netanyahu's spectacularly self-immolating lectures. Beyond its farcical and parodic elements, the novel's real source of tension is ideological and characterological, pitting Blum's assimilationist and accommodationist docility-- and his mortal fear of being associated with anything, you know, too Jewish-- against Netanyahu's militantly uncompromising dogmatism and insistence that the world will always be murderously hostile to Jews, and that the next pogrom is always right around the corner.In such a short semi-comic novel, all of these elements would normally be highly combustible and explosive, but Cohen narrates them with masterful precision, intellectual rigor, tight control, and perfect pacing."

17,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5864678-jan-rice,Rating 4 out of 5,"Thanks to all the recent readers of this review. I've subsequently completed my 2nd read of the book. I was in charge of a small-group discussion, and there's nothing like that to motivate a wrestling match between me and the book.The original review is immediately below, followed by the update.Rube and the YahoosI once made a lame joke in Torah study to the effect that it was a good thing Reuben got himself disqualified in favor of Judah; otherwise, instead of ""the Jews"" we would have been ""the Rubes.""So when Ruben Blum, the narrator and protagonist of this story, and also the first Jewish faculty member Jew ever at the fictional Corbin College, is called ""Rube"" by his department head, I thought it was just another microaggression. But, no: that's Ruben's nickname; that's what he calls himself.Ruben has been called into Dr. Morse's office and told he's been chosen (ha ha) to take charge of a prospective hire's visit. That would be Dr. Ben-Zion Netanyahu. Will the father of the (until recently) future Israeli prime minister be Corbin's second Jew?The senior Netanyahu arrives with wife and three rowdy sons in tow, and hilarity ensues (or not).In the course of the book, traditionalist Jews, invariably from Eastern Europe, are defined as those who wish to hang on to some semblance of Jewish identity and who fear accommodation to American mores will erode that identity. In case the picture is not clear enough, they also fear assimilation will lead inevitably to passive disarmament and, before long, going (once again) like lambs to the slaughter. Well, it is 1959 and not that long post-Holocaust.But any shred of Jewish particularism comes hand-in-hand with all the rest.In the scenario imagined by this book, Eastern Europeans = Zionists = right-wingers. Western Europeans were the passive leftists.In this dichotomy, where are modern Americans Jews circa 1959, other than literally in the wilds of New York State? Ruben Blum and family: who are they? What do they stand for? They don't know!They want to be American. As such, they espouse universalist values.They bend over backward to fit in.They abhor these pushy demanding people.They are passive victims to these Yahus. Even masochistic.Joshua Cohen shapes these factors into a polarity that some professional reviewers are eager to embrace as history. He does cast them into high relief.Ostensibly, his ""bad guys"" are (of course) the ""right-wing"" particularists. (The opposite of the breakdown in Philip Roth's ""Eli, the Fanatic."")He runs the risk of recapitulating the snobby attitude of early-twentieth century German-American Jews toward the influx of Eastern European Jews, whose otherness might affect their own status and acceptance.Who does the author want to send up? To take down?Who in this book are the ""good"" Jews?I started out being reminded of Roth, then Michael Chabon and his anti-Jewish particularism, and now maybe I've circled back to Roth.Either by design or by accident, the author paints such an uncertain, passive, and unattractive picture of the assimilationists that he comes close to proving the point their antagonists are making. After my first time through, the review ended here.The Second ReadingThe history according to The Netanyahus bothered me: the sweeping stereotypical characterizations of wide swaths of Jews in recent history, on top of the way the author conformed his groups to the political polarization we have today. I had learned something about the development of Zionism in Eastern Europe, but it didn't jibe with what Joshua Cohen's book says. And I knew next to nothing about Benjamin Netanyahu's father and the career of Jabotinsky.Well, Ben-Zion was a Jabotinsky disciple. That's right. But Vladimir Ze'ev Jabotinsky was 20 years younger than Theodor Herzl. Herzl was born in 1860 and Jabotinsky in 1880. Therefore he was 17 years old at the time of the First Zionist Congress. Now 17 then isn't 17 now, and by the time Jabotinsky was 18 and 19, he was a journalist. But he was not a Zionist. That happened after he was galvanized by the Kishinev pogrom in Bessarabia, in 1903 -- or maybe by Chaim Nachman Bialik's poem ""In the City of Slaughter"" about the pogrom. It was designed to galvanize (in today's language, to outrage), and it did its job with many young men. Bialik, too, had been residing in Odessa, a center of the development of Zionist thought in Eastern Europe. For that matter, so had Ahad Ha'am, who, before Herzl, had been the putative father of Zionism. And far from wanting to take up arms for his cause, Ahad Ha'am was quite patient for the culture to emerge. He thought only the cultural and intellectual elite of the Jews need return to Zion, from there to light the way for the diaspora, which he thought would and should continue to constitute the masses of Jews.What was on the horizon -- what we now call the Holocaust -- Ahad Ha'am didn't see coming. Herzl did. It was Theodor Herzl, that scion of assimilated Western European Jews, who was in a hurry, not the Eastern European Jewish intellectuals, at least not until Herzl lit a fire under them.Once Jabotinsky developed Zionist leanings, he idolized Herzl. He was not his ""rival,"" as Cohen writes in his epilogue. He didn't have much time to be, since Herzl was dead in 1904, having blown out his heart with his efforts.Maybe what's meant is that Jabotinsky became a right-winger and did want to take up arms. That history I have yet to pursue. Although maybe circa the mid- and late-1930s, being in that kind of a hurry was not as unreasonable as Joshua Cohen and/or his characters make it sound.Jabotinsky himself died of a heart attack in 1940. How would his nationalistic ideas have changed after the end of the war? After the founding of the state of Israel?Most of the early Zionist migrants to the Land of Israel were the poor and the young from Eastern Europe. They had been the victims of the pogroms, and, being poor and young, had less to lose. But I wouldn't say Zionist ideas in Eastern Europe were a poor people's product. No, they were born among the intellectuals, like new ideas everywhere.These ideas are in lots of books. They are out there! If I can find them in the last 12 or 13 years, or via Google, surely Joshua Cohen cut his teeth on them!So why the garbled history?That's why I've begun to entertain the idea of unreliable narrator(s). Yes, multiple unreliable narrators.There is some evidence beyond the apparent unlikeliness of his getting it so wrong.He plays with names. The original name of his character who gives most of the ""Zionist history"" means ""liar"" in German. That character also has this line:... The history of Zionism is so difficult to recount, and all attempts evanesce into metaphysics. ...On my first read, I thought the author was just being intellectually lazy. That's a line that could discourage the reader from checking out the author!Well, I don't know.I do know if you look for patterns you will see them.Maybe this ""unreliable narrator"" pattern is more interesting than seeing the author as following in Michael Chabon's footsteps, or something of the kind.I could also learn more about Joshua Cohen by reading his earlier books. But that may be a bridge too far....One more thing. That professional reviewer who said Joshua Cohen only attracted interest and eventually approbation because he used a famous name. That's ""predicting"" something that has already happened. A real prediction that the name ""Netanyahu"" would do that would have to have been made before the book was published.Since the book has make me think this hard, it gets another star."

Oddly, for a 235-page book, the Netanyahus do not ""land"" until p. 135 or so. Up until then, a lot of angst and foreshadowing and humor. Well, humor after that page, too. Before it's most memorable when the laws and the in-laws visit (the text reads like a sitcom script here).Then, after the infamous Family N. lands, the humor moves to Benzion Netanyahu and his handful-ain't-the-word-for-it wife as well as their three devil incarnate sons. Most notable is how the author uses Netanyahu's field of expertise (Iberian Jews in the Middle Ages), ignorance (he thinks upstate New York is part of New England), and fierce individualism to make the book so quixotic and erudite. This while slapstick humor is tumbling to the floor (or a snowbank) and rolling all around it.If you think this is easy to pull off, I wish you well in trying it. Though it's not consistently funny, it is funny so often that it's hard to complain without coming across as overcritical and petty. So you read, disbelieve, laugh, turn pages, and actually learn a little about the Jews (for starters, stop considering them as a monolithic bloc with like beliefs and opinions)Deceivingly complex, in its way.

Except that narrator, Ruben Blum, is really based on Harold Bloom and his for-real encounter with those Netanyahus, so that part is kinda true too.This is inventive. And it's definitely Jewish. I mean a lot of it is an exploration of what it means to be Jewish. A lot of it is scholarly, in the sense that characters are giving erudite college lectures. But they weren't boring. Everyone says this is funny and, sure, much of it is. There's a building that was once a synagogue but is now a Church of the Assumption, and the narrator has a lot of literal fun with that. Me too. But characters could become stereotypical, caricaturish, like the narrator's parents who could be George Costanza's parents. That made me wince.Inventive?

21,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54028986-dan,Rating 5 out of 5,"After finishing The Netanyahus: An account of a minor and ultimately even negligible episode in the history of a very famous family, I wondered if Joshua Cohen redefined the possibilities and boundaries of historical fiction. Is The Netanyahus an historical farce; an historical comedy; or more likely, a blazingly original and weird mixture of pure fiction and slapstick built upon an actual event recounted to the author by none other than Professor Harold Bloom. Regardless of its classification, The Netanyahus masterfully combines point-on re-creation of American Jewish culture in the 1950s and 1960s with wry observations on American Jewish interpretations of Jewish history. The Netanyahus tells the story of Ruvn (AKA Reuben) Blum, a professor of tax history in a small upstate New York college in which he‚Äôs the first Jew ever to step on campus. Professor Blum is assigned to shepherd Ben-Zion Netanyahu through his interview for a faculty post, since, of course, the only Jewish professor should accompany the only Jewish faculty applicant, although their fields don‚Äôt overlap in the least. Here‚Äôs a conversation between the history department chair and Blum: ‚Äù‚ÄôApparently one of the candidates is particularly promising. A Europeonist whose specialty is the Medieval era. . . Iberia, I think? Fifteenth century, was it? Anyway, we‚Äôd like to have your opinion.‚Äô / ‚ÄòMine?‚Äô / ‚ÄòYour opinion in particular.‚Äô / This was puzzling. He‚Äôd like to have my opinion of what? The Medieval Era? Which was the same as the Middle Ages? Which was the same as the Dark Ages? When it came to that era, I was less its expert than its citizen, its denizen, an illiterate peasant in the middling dark. I mean, I knew when the 15th century was, between the 14th and the 16th, but that was like saying I knew where the Sugar Pops were in the A&P, in the cereal aisle below the Cocoa Puffs and Cocoa Krispies.‚Äù. And here Netanyahu himself sums up the situation for Blum: ‚Äù‚ÄôThe History Department must decide upon a Jew and so enlists another Jew for help. Their own Jew. A Jew who is known to them. A Jew they at least partially trust. . . This is a venerable historical office. Usually inherited, a patrimony. El judio de corte, der Hofjude, the Court Jew. The protected Jew. The useful Jew to keep in your pocket. . .‚Äô‚Äù Following Netanyahu‚Äôs interview by the hiring committee, he offers his opinion to Blum: ‚Äù‚ÄôYou and the rest of the committee.‚Äô He spat. ‚ÄòMorons, Imbeciles, Idiots. That‚Äôs the classification I remember, the trinity of defective mental categories. Not Father, Son, Holy Ghost, but Morons, Imbeciles, Idiots.‚Äô‚ÄùJoshua Cohen‚Äôs The Netanyahus contains many delights. My favorites are those passages in which Cohen directly channels Philip Roth, as when the ‚Äùwho-shall-remain-nameless then-president of the American Historical Association . . . [commented to Blum] ‚ÄòAh,‚Äô he said, limply pressing my hand, ‚ÄòBlum, did you say? A Jewish historian?‚Äô‚Äù Then there‚Äôs this observation smacking of absolute authenticity: ‚ÄùNo one reading this, in the third millennium of Christendom, can have any idea ‚Äî none at all ‚Äî of what it meant to be a kid in 1960 encountering not just a TV but one in color. First off, in 1960, owning a TV wasn‚Äôt anti-intellectual, or some surrender to the hive-mind, but modern. Owning a color TV was more than that, it was fancy, it was elite, so much so that I was almost ashamed: it was a profligacy of Steinmetzian proportions.‚Äù And the warring in-laws, each representing radically different strands of American Jewry, and each despising the backgrounds and affectations of the other. Finally, Cohen treats us to Blum‚Äôs daughter‚Äôs unforgettable nose job and her sexual initiation.The Netanyahus is worth reading and then rereading, only to discover more treasures within. 4.5 stars"

Yes, this book features the family of the Benjamin Netanyahu, frequent prime minister of Israel. His father, mostly, but Bibi is there in a supporting role. The story is told by the fictional Reuben Blum, a stand-in for critic Harold Bloom, who shared an anecdote with Joshua Cohen that became the seed for this book. Blum is a young professor at a college in a rural portion of western New York State. In 1959, as the first Jew on the faculty, he is asked to participate in the hiring committee of one Benzion Netanyahu, to act as a kind of cultural intermediary. Blum, desperate to assimilate, struggles to make sense of Benzion‚Äôs sole publication and his wildly divergent recommendation letters, while coping with his wife, daughter, parents, and in-laws, fellow faculty members, and the local population.All of this leads up to the day of Benzion‚Äôs interview, when he arrives at Blum‚Äôs house with wife and three boys unexpectedly in tow. It is at this point that the humor, which has been bubbling dangerously all along, boils over the pot with disastrous results.IMO, The Netanyahus is fully deserving of the Pulitzer Prize it won earlier this year. It‚Äôs a very Jewish book, but not only a Jewish book. The observations on assimilation alone, on the challenges of being outside the norm, have broad application. And the humor - well, that‚Äôs pretty much universal.Aside #1: Although Harold Bloom‚Äôs story took place at Cornell, where he taught, Cohen sets his story in Chautauqua County, in the far west of the state on the shores of Lake Erie. A location where I lived for many years while my wife taught at the local state college. While the geography, weather and many place names were familiar, the schools were very different. Aside #2: I listened to the audiobook, which was produced by Malcolm Gladwell‚Äôs Pushkin+, which creates (I gather) podcasts and audiobooks. The author was the narrator for most of the book, with one chapter read by David Duchovny and another by Ethan Herschenfeld. While listening I noticed what appeared to be periodic mispronunciations by Cohen. Since his erudition appears extensive, I couldn‚Äôt figure out whether I was mishearing, whether I didn‚Äôt understand the correct pronunciation myself (I actually double-checked on verdigris), or whether Cohen was staying in character as Blum, a striver who was more immersed in tax history than literature and languages. If anyone who has listened knows the answer or has an opinion, I‚Äôd be interested.Aside #3: Thanks to Judith, whose review prompted me to try this marvelous reading experience!"

That‚Äôs the point of something you aspire to.This novel is a departure for Mr. Cohen. No trace of Cohen's early need ( see Witz) to dominate, to dazzle with action of vocabulary and metaphoric hijinks‚Äîleaving all anxious influences struck dumb in his wake. Perhaps a maturation, or an evolved sense of utility? I maintain an oblique curiosity about such matters. I have fashioned a series of dense, nearly impenetrable works, why don't I aim for something accessible, almost anecdotal? I read Cohen‚Äôs collected nonfiction a few months ago and marveled at his eye for detail and corresponding restraint. This novel continues this tendency. Such is a re-imagining of Bibi‚Äôs father and clan seeking academic employment in the New York of the early 1960s. The wife of the protagonist muses late in the novel about how passionate she and her husband were in younger years. I have no beliefs and I‚Äôm OK with it; I‚Äôm more than OK, I‚Äôm glad. . . I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm getting older without convictions. . .Perhaps it is rash to think the author has found a similar perch whether through resignation or some dialectic. I loved this novel, finding it a campus fiction with an apocalyptic promise. There are no spared barbs and regardless of whether the details are accurate there‚Äôs an agenda afoot."
24,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18868296-albert,Rating 3 out of 5,"There are several ways to look at this novel; I will take the simple approach. Ruben Blum is the sole Jewish professor at a small college in upper state New York. He has a very bright and manipulative daughter who is currently applying to colleges. Ruben‚Äôs wife, Edith, is limited by their location in what jobs or career she can pursue and is frustrated as a result. The story takes place in late 1959 to early 1960. The first half of the story focuses on the Blum‚Äôs. Ruben is assigned to a hiring committee; his department is pursuing a Jewish candidate, Ben-Zion Netanyahu, and feel they need a Jew on the committee to better understand the candidate and to make the candidate feel welcome. Ben-Zion, his wife Tzila and their three boys, including Benjamin, the middle child and future Prime Minister of Israel, travel to Corbin University so that Ben-Zion can interview for the position. The make-up of the Netanyahu family as portrayed is accurate and the general outline of the story is apparently accurate, as the author shares in the postscript, but in other ways the story has been highly fictionalized. You learn nothing about Benjamin at age 10 that would help you foresee his future, but you do gain an understanding of Benjamin‚Äôs father, Ben-Zion, and his goals, efforts and beliefs, which shed some light on Benjamin‚Äôs future career. This novel is very dry in places as it delves into and explains Ben-Zion's intellectual pursuits, but parts of the novel are hilarious. I realize the humor in this book can at times seem like a series of pratfalls: I was reminded of Chevy Chase‚Äôs Christmas Vacation. This type of humor is clearly not for everyone, but the scene where the Netanyahus meet the Blums and in particular where we observe the interactions between Ben-Zion and his wife Tzila had me chuckling and sometimes laughing out loud. Likewise, an earlier scene between Ruben and his mother-in-law, Sabine, was quite funny. Prior to reading this novel I was very much aware of Benjamin Netanyahu and some of his history, but this novel motivated me to read more about him. I have always found Israeli politics confusing, and while this novel and my subsequent reading have not cleared up that confusion, they have certainly helped me understand some of the layers and complexity that were previously unknown to me.

25,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33119635-neil,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Netanyahus is a very clever book. It is clever in the words it uses (I had to look up several words as I read). But it is also clever in the conflicts it brings about, including in the reader‚Äôs head.Our narrator is Ruben Blum. In an afterword, Cohen explains that the book is based on an anecdote told to him by Harold Bloom, the literary critic who died in 2019 and who called Cohen‚Äôs Book of Numbers one of the four best books by a Jewish-American novelist (I have no idea what the other 3 books are!). The similarity between Blum and Bloom is probably deliberate although Blum is not, I don‚Äôt think, supposed to actually be Bloom. From what I have read, however, it seems Cohen has stuck pretty much to the facts as he was told them for the rest of the story.As the story begins, Ruben Blum and his family (wife Edith and daughter Judith) are living in upper New York state and trying fairly hard to fit themselves into the gentile culture around them. Judith hates her nose (and ends up taking fairly drastic action to do something about it). Ruben is asked to be part of the panel interviewing a candidate for a professorship at the college he works in. That candidate is Benzion Netanyahu and Ruben‚Äôs conflict in the book is that he has been asked to take part because he is Jewish. It‚Äôs a Catch-22 situation: if he recommends Netanyahu for the post it will be seen as Jewish favouritism, but, if he does not recommend him, it will be seen as trying to avoid the appearance of Jewish favouritism.When Netanyahu arrives (unexpectedly bringing his family with him), a second conflict is set up. Benzion Netanyahu is a real historical figure known as a hardline Revisionist Zionist. His time with Ruben (attempting to fit in with the society around him by, effectively, hiding his Jewishness) is bound to bring tensions.And once the Netanyahu family arrives, chaos comes with them. Several reviews refer to the book as ‚Äúlaugh out loud funny‚Äù, but there‚Äôs a discomfort to the comedy because the conflict set up for the reader is whether or not they should actually be laughing at this. I have to admit that I didn‚Äôt actually laugh out loud. Except when Ruben says ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not holy, it‚Äôs just a nice rug‚Äù which really did make me laugh. The book‚Äôs portrayal of the Netanyahu family as a walking disaster area feels awkward to read, but I imagine this is exactly what the author intended as he raises questions about how much a Jewish historian should be a representative of Jewish history (I borrowed that phrase from a review in the Financial Times).I have mixed feelings at the end of the book. It is very well written but the farce elements were, for me, a bit off-putting. I did like the way the different conflicts were set up and explored in the book, though, so I find myself in favour of it overall."

27,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24672869-nastya,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Netanyahus: An Account of a Minor and Ultimately Even Negligible Episode in the History of a Very Famous Family, this minor episode being based on the anecdote of Harold Bloom about meeting the Netanyahu family in the 50s. In short: Ruben Blum, a historian who happens to be jewish, not a historian of Jews, gets a task to interview Ben-zion Netanyahu for the position in his small provincial college being the only other Jew there, the famous family arrives and mayhem ensues. This is a novel about identity, Jewish identity to be precise. Old world jews vs new world jews; American assimilating jews vs nationalists of Israel; Jews from the Bloodlands vs prosperous jews from Western Europe.And all this is told with wit and sometimes mockery. Joshua Cohen doesn‚Äôt pull punches at Netanyahus, they come out as quite a bunch of chaotic ridiculous pushy whiny people, there's not munch sympathy here.I wanted to read it the first time it came out, but after it won the Pulitzer, I took it as a sign. And I had a great time with it. Somehow the Pulitzer turns out to be the most fresh and interesting literary prize of all that I vaguely follow.Just a few quotes I enjoyed:And so my childhood was tugged between conflicting exceptionalisms, between the American condition of being able to choose and the Jewish condition of being chosen . . .And so it might be more accurate to say that though Dr. Netanyahu was certainly a believer, he didn‚Äôt believe in an all-powerful God so much as he believed in the all-powerful goys, who were obviously more accountable and identifiable to academia than God was. Because unlike God, these kings, queens, ecclesiastics, and Jew-butchers who ruled the Jewish world had names and dates and places of residence and nationalities; they could be quoted with citation, marked by crosses and stars.I might cite, in this regard, such luminaries and American patriots as Dr. Albert Einstein and Dr. Hannah Arendt. Do we hold against these folks a ‚Äúgap‚Äù in their CVs between 1933 and 1945? Do we decide against them because their employment histories have ‚Äúholes‚Äù? Of course not! That would be lunacy! And while the lacunae in Ben‚Äôs career are of a different nature, they‚Äôre not unrelated. Because while he himself didn‚Äôt suffer the European ordeal, he certainly did have to contend with less-than-ideal Palestinian conditions, from typewriter shortages and typewriter-ribbon rationing to Arab arsonists and biblioclasts who kept trying to torch the university archives. In other words, history came also to him.Just about a decade prior to the autumn I‚Äôm recalling, the State of Israel was founded. In that minuscule country halfway across the globe, displaced and refugee Jews were busy reinventing themselves into a single people, united by the hatreds and subjugations of contrary regimes, in a mass-process of solidarity aroused by gross antagonism. Simultaneously, a kindred mass-process was occurring here in America, where Jews were busy being deinvented, or uninvented, or assimilated, by democracy and market-forces, intermarriage and miscegenation. Regardless of where they were and the specific nature and direction of the process, however, it remains an incontrovertible fact that nearly all of the world‚Äôs Jews were involved at midcentury in becoming something else; and that at this point of transformation, the old internal differences between them‚Äîof former citizenship and class, to say nothing of language and degree of religious observance‚Äîbecame for a brief moment more palpable than ever, giving one last death-rattle gasp.Love is generally a one-to-one affair and mortal, but hatreds tend toward immortal typologies, with each change of identity becoming translated into more relevant terms, so that the Old World distinctions between my Ukrainian/Russian Jewish parents and Edith‚Äôs Rhenish Jewish parents became, in the New World, secularized rivalries between the Bronx and Manhattan, the Grand Concourse and Upper Broadway; mass-transit v. Cadillacs; no days off v. Lorelei vacations and half the year in Florida.The earliest Zionist Congresses were split between these polar-opposite positions‚Äîbetween the ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù ‚Äúevolutionary‚Äù Zionism of the West, and the ‚Äúpractical‚Äù ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù Zionism of the East, whose disagreements centered on geography and method: the questions of whether a land or the land should be negotiated for or seized.According to the son‚Äôs Revisionist obituaries, Rabbi Mileikowsky died not of any of the chronic diseases that he was afflicted with but from grief that men so dedicated to the cause of Jewish statehood would be so harshly treated.No student, however brilliant, would be forgiven this behavior, and Netanyahu was only brilliant by foreign standards‚Äîa statement I make with due respect. At any American institution, he would have been ‚Äúa star,‚Äù but please remember that historical circumstances have conspired to hold Israel to a higher standard. Each year Netanyahu was at Hebrew University, new refugees streamed in, until, on the eve of the Second World War, the school was a monstrous teeming haven of the best faculties of Europe, all jostling each other for prestige. In the History Department alone we had Baer, Koebner, and Tcherikover, who together were fluent in something like 22 languages;Tell me how, in this atmosphere where everyone was a world-historical genius in Tanakh, Talmud, Kabbalah, Hasidut, cuneiform, modal logic, matter, anti-matter, and quantum dynamics; where everyone had a theorem named after them and field-defining publications translated into Esperanto and a dragon‚Äôs hoard of advanced degrees from the universities of Berlin, Munich, Paris, Basel, Zurich, Vienna, Petersburg, and Moscow‚Äîtell me how, in these conditions, a position could be found for an Israeli-educated malcontent with no PhD and no book and a history of inciting terrorist violence?The world is full of real events, real things, which have been lost in their destruction and are only remembered as having existed in written history. But Zion, because it was remembered not as written history but as interpretable story, was able to exist again in actuality, with the founding of the modern state of Israel. With the establishment of Israel, the poetic was returned to the practical. This is the first example ever in human civilization in which this happened‚Äîin which a story became real; it became a real country with a real army, real essential services, real treaties and real trade pacts, real supply chains and real sewage. Now that Israel exists, however, the days of the Bible tales are finished and the true history of my people can finally begin and if any Jewish Question still remains to be answered it‚Äôs whether my people have the ability or appetite to tell the difference.‚ÄùBoth my daughter and Netanyahu were natural overactors whose best roles were in assigning the blame they deserved to others, and demanding to be applauded for it, and pitying themselves when they weren‚Äôt."
28,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/123715572-jay,Rating 4 out of 5,"I was all over this. Cohen has been on my radar for a while, and, for many months, I‚Äôve had a copy of The Netanyahus sitting, waiting patiently, somewhere down in the thick of the big pile of ‚Äúbought-on-a-whim-and-soon-to-be-read‚Äù books that I keep in my flat. However, having purchased it ages ago, I hadn‚Äôt touched it since. I had it in my head that it was going to be an intensely dense book ‚Äî a sort of Thomas Pynchon for the new era ‚Äî and, even though I was intrigued, my trepidation outweighed my curiosity. This misconception was mostly instigated by the tone of the reviews I‚Äòd read of Cohen‚Äôs previous and much longer novel, Book of Numbers, which had been brought to my attention, last summer, by Harold Bloom‚Äôs The Bright Book of Life. Bloom, himself, said that Cohen is ‚Äúa difficult writer and is likely to become even more difficult‚Äù and that ‚ÄúBook of Numbers is difficult enough and has to call upon invention to palliate readers having an arduous experience‚Äù. I‚Äôll remind you that these were the thoughts of a man who had Moby-Dick committed to memory, and who, I am informed, could read 1,000 pages an hour, so perhaps you‚Äôll agree that my concerns about the inaccessibility of Cohen‚Äôs latest book weren‚Äôt entirely without cause. The clear message was that Cohen was going to be no fluffy, cosy soft toy of an author. I found myself picturing him as a kind of superhuman hyper-being with a pen, too clever to concern himself with my basic requirements for entertainment. However, a few days ago, while looking for something short to read between instalments of In Search of Lost Time, I did finally pull The Netanyahus out from the middle of my big pile. Opening it up, I was immediately pleased to discover that the reality was quite different to what I‚Äôd been led to expect: My experience was that Cohen is an astonishingly readable writer. In fact, given the intellectual intensity of his writing, I feel like he has no right to be as glossily readable as he is. Furthermore, The Netanyahus‚Äôs addictive, conversational readability is just one of the many things about it that keep making you ask: How is this guy doing this?By about 40 pages in, I was convinced that the hype surrounding Cohen is, indeed, entirely justified. There was one paragraph which, in particular, made that specific penny drop. It starts on page 40 with ‚ÄúIt was the differences with history that got me the most‚Äù, and ends on page 42 with ‚Äúcarnage was the Jewish destiny and those of us who didn‚Äôt survive could at least be sure that those who did would interpret our deaths as foreordained and sacrificial‚Äù. It‚Äôs too long to quote in full, but, in its proper context, I thought it an almighty piece of writing, and the fireworks kept on coming from there.The whole book is essentially one big gag ‚Äî right up to its deliberate punch line of a final sentence ‚Äî; however, it reads as the kind of comedy which is truer to human interaction than a lot of the monochrome works of dramatic fiction which we tend to exalt. It covers a whole range of serious, and touchy subjects, but I felt like it never tries to overreach, nor is it overtly one-sided, and the comedic aspects are used to lighten the seriousness of the ideas.I was initially tempted to go with five stars, but, in the end, I‚Äôve decided to stick with four and a half (mostly because I‚Äôd like to reserve my five for when I read something of Cohen‚Äôs that is a bit more substantial and because you don‚Äôt get no 3.18 average rating on Goodreads by being Mr. Chips ‚Äî and, yes, I‚Äôm weirdly proud of my low average). I would like to say, mind you, that I think this is one of the best new books I‚Äôve read in ages. It‚Äôs a worthy tribute to Harold Bloom and I like to imagine that he would have enjoyed it. He would, no doubt, have said something like: ‚ÄúIt is a misfortune that my own transformation into Ruben Blum is neither as large nor as complex a creation as the respawning of Benzion Netanyahu ‚Äî whose intellectual magnitude and canonically unpleasant irascibility piteously defeats Blum‚Äôs ingratiating mediocrity ‚Äî but my commitment to aesthetic merit and invention impedes me from criticising Cohen‚Äôs choice‚Äù. Almost brings a tear to the eye."

Fiction/anecdote mashup featuring Harold Bloom‚Äôs story of meeting Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs father, transposed onto a middling American academic serving reluctantly on a hiring committee as the only other Jew in town?I think I‚Äôm not qualified to judge this one.I will say it was great fun to read, at least the first half, what I‚Äôm assuming to be the more fictional half, because Ruben Blum is not Harold Bloom, and I very much enjoyed the building of his character, his wife, his daughter, his appalling in-laws and parents, his escape from New York to the snowy wastes in the form of mediocre college town Corbindale.The actual Netanyahu half tipped too far into the realm of farce for me, though it was a good read too. I enjoyed the depictions of passive-aggressive anti-semitism, but also of raving Zionism, of academic in-fighting, of Jewish childhoods, without feeling like I could really parse them, where Cohen was ultimately coming down, if he was coming down anywhere.

33,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6997828-bonnie-g,Rating 5 out of 5,"Hilarious, smart, challenging, edifying, just a great read. This is more of a 4.5, but I rounded up because it is so damn fun.This is my first book by Joshua Cohen. When I started looking into him I saw a number of comments indicating he is the new David Foster Wallace. I see what the commenters are saying, but I don't agree. DFW is a midwestern boy no matter how much time he spent in East Coast ivory towers. I see a lot more Jonathan Lethem here than DFW. I absolutely get that quoting another review of my own is pretty gross, but I am going to do it anyway. In a review of a Lethem book I said ""It is hard to decide if Jonathan Lethem is more in love with his general self-loathing or his certainty that all else be damned, he is the smartest guy in the room."" All of this applies to Joshua Cohen. But Cohen is, to quote another East Coast Jew with a jaundiced eye and impeccable wit, the master of his domain. Lethem spins off into rabbit holes and forgets what story he was trying to tell. Cohen does not, he tells his story and he tells it well. His digressions are amusing and brief and never took me out of the story. What is that story? Well it is a good one.Apparently Harold Bloom told Cohen the story of his meeting with Bibi Netanyahu's father, and from that story this book arose. After a lifetime in NYC our MC Ruben Blum (everyone calls him ""Rube"") has taken a job at an upstate New York college where he is the only Jew, (faculty, staff or student.) His parents and his in-laws behave like he has moved to a place where Western civilization can no longer be glimpsed. It is the 60's and the women's movement has not yet hit Ithaca (yeah, it is Cornell, though in the book it is ""Corbin"") so Rube's wife is pressed into the role of faculty wife-sidekick despite her intelligence and education . Rube's daughter misses the city but makes the effort to fit in with the cool kids in bucolic Corbin and in doing so she fully embraces all things goyish. Ruben is up for tenure so despite being aware of the many issues he is not rocking any boats. When the history department decides to vet a candidate for a newly opened tenure track spot somehow Benzion Netanyahu (Bibi's father) ends up on their radar. Because he is Jewish Ruben finds himself on the welcome committee for the Netanyahu clan and hijinks ensue. The book is a deep dive into Zionism and both Jewish identity and Jewish-American identity (they are different things, really.) These are complicated issues that most of the Jewish people I know deal with. Earlier I quoted Larry David, and when reading this I kept thinking of a scene from Curb your Enthusiasm where Susie Essman and Larry David are yelling at each other ""you're a jewface"" ""I'm a jewface? No you're a jewface."" (Its a really great episode.) For many Jewish Americans there are elements of old school Jewishness that make us squirm. The yelling, the hondeling, the conspicuous displays of spending power, the presumption, the pushiness. That is not me, (well I am loud, that is true) and though (unlike Ruben) I have no desire to not be identified as Jewish I am really bothered when I see that sort of behavior from Jewish people because I know people are going to make the same assumptions about me. Side note: It really did feel like Ruben's goal was to fully assimilate. He was like Ralph Lauren (nee Lifshitz) - the Jew trying to be waspier than the wasps. Ruben's last line in the book truly encapsulates this, and it made me bark a laugh on the train so suddenly that the woman next to me skootched away from me. So yes, we reject this stuff, and we can make fun of it, but we also have to reckon with what makes us Jewish if we are so set on distancing ourselves from that real part of our culture. This is hard stuff! Anyway, Cohen goes there, and I laughed a lot on recognition and admiration, but also, I learned a lot. There is a bunch of information on the Spanish Inquisition that was enlightening to say the least. And did I mention it was funny? (The book was funny, not the Inquisition. The Inquisition was not funny, other than as interpreted by Mel Brooks.)So why did I start by saying this is a 4.5 and not a 5? There are some problems. I mentioned the Jonathan Lethem connection in my head, and in part that is because both Lethem and Cohen are really really pretentious. I am not a person who is put off by preening displays of intellect. Believe me when I say my life would be miserable if I was one of those people because I am surrounded by that pretty much all the time. And if I am being honest I can occasionally be one of those people (though I am not half as smart or informed as Cohen or Lethem so I have less material to work with.) Still, I was a little put off by the pretension, the casual assumption that the reader was well versed enough in the differing approaches to and definitions of Zionism and the last 600 years of European history and the entrenched behaviors of Ivy faculty that no elucidation would be necessary. And perhaps paradoxically because Cohen is so broad in his references he can be downright pedantic when it comes to discussing things Jewish. I felt sometimes like he was in my head telling me why my opinions on Zionism and my ""performance"" of Jewishness were all wrong -- like he was picking away at all my factual and emotional truths and finding them ridiculous. I felt lectured to in parts, and that wasn't great. Overall though, this is genius. I am not sure it will resonate with non-Jews, but I am guessing if you enjoy Bellow and Roth, and especially if you like Jonathan Lethem it will work for you."
34,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1381728-maxwell,Rating 4 out of 5,"I will be the first to admit I don't know much about what this book was talking about. It contains a fair bit of academia about Jewish history, and is itself commenting on the Netanyahu family, specifically Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his father, Ben-Zion Netanyahu.I honestly didn't realize until near the end that the characters in this were based on real people. I was familiar with the name, but assumed this was just taking that as inspiration. And yes, this is fiction so it's taking some creative liberty with the actual events that occurred, but the main character Ruben Blum is also loosely based on author Harold Bloom (with whom I'm also unfamiliar).All that being said, I really enjoyed this book! It was just the perfect balance of serious and outlandish, that sort of quirky modern novel that uses its hilarity to comment on the existential dread of living. And Cohen does it through a distinctly Jewish perspective, much like famed Jewish writers before him. It feels fresh though. It reminded me of a mix of Stoner by John Williams and Crossroads by Jonathan Franzen, if it was written by Jonathan Safran Foer. Did I understand everything it contained or what it was trying to say? Nope. But the ride was worth it and I could see myself revisiting this one in the future. It makes me interested in learning more about the history it talks about and going down a Wikipedia rabbit hole. I enjoy when a book opens my mind to something I'd be ignorant of otherwise, even if I'm not able to fully comprehend everything on my first reading.There's no doubt Cohen is a skilled writer. While this won't be for everyone, those who appreciate social commentary, situation comedies, and academia (and books focused on academia) will likely appreciate this!"

The story takes place in the sixties when Prof Blum had to look after Benzion Netanyahu, a Zionist revisionist, who was trying to get a fellowship at the same university.If the name sounds familiar it's because this Netanyahu is the father of Jonathan Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister for many years.I'm not Jewish and I'm no Jewish history expert, but I was interested in the non-fiction bits, even though, at times, they were dry and a bit over my head.I'm always interested in reading about people's duality when it comes to their origin, background etc. That was well done.Using real people as characters in a work of fiction is tricky. I personally don't think it was necessary.So, to conclude my ramblings, this was unique and interesting, I just didn't quite love it."
36,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73115613-wes-allen,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Netanyahus by Joshua CohenMany months have passed since I last penned a review: The Netanyahus is worth the time it takes to type one up.A couple years back, I read Cohen‚Äôs early novel Witz. At over 800 pages of dense, unremitting post-modern prose, Witz was exhausting at times. For its shortcomings, which I have detailed elsewhere, the book makes one thing eminently clear: Cohen has writing chops. When I read Witz, I recall thinking that Cohen could come into his own if he would only curb some of that opaque verbosity‚Äìthat showmanship that characterized Witz. While the maximalist novel holds a special place in my heart, not every author can effectively bring it to fruition. (Cohen‚Äôs results here are mixed.)And The Netanyahus is not a maximalist novel, but it is good‚Äìmuch better, in fact, than Witz. How Cohen manages to cram so much into 237 short pages is unclear, but he does so with aplomb. The plot is plain enough: A New England Jewish professor, Ruben Blum, is coerced into a committee formed to evaluate one Benzion Netanyahu as a potential addition to the faculty. Of course, Ruben‚Äôs prime qualification here is his Jewishness. Upon him falls the onus of making B. Netanyahu feel ‚Äúat home‚Äù during his visit to Corbin College. When Netanyahu arrives with family in tow, hijinks ensue. ‚ÄúHijinks‚Äù is the right word here, as The Netanyahus is that rare book that both purports to be and actually is funny. After Witz, I had the sinking feeling that Cohen was another of those ‚Äúcomic‚Äù authors destitute of anything resembling humor, too self-serious to make the layman chortle. Thankfully, Cohen‚Äôs wry comedy features throughout all of The Netanyahus. See, for example, the exchange on p. 19 between Blum and department chair Dr. Morse: When discussing slashes to the budget, Morse remarks, ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt worry, Rube. You have no reason to worry‚Ä¶And anyway, haven‚Äôt you been cut already?‚Äù After Blum responds with concern, Morse deftly clears it up: ‚ÄúI was merely trying to lighten the occasion by making reference to circumcision.‚Äù As the only Jewish faculty, Blum bears the brunt of many such droll witticisms; his longsuffering is laudable. Another laugh-out-loud section of dialogue can be found on p. 55, when Blum and his daughter Judy engage in a tiff re: her vacation plans. Judy says,‚ÄúI‚Äôm supposed to tell the only friends I‚Äôve ever had, sorry, I won‚Äôt be coming east for West Side Story, count me out for The Miracle Worker with Patty Duke as Helen Keller, who at least was born deaf and blind, whereas I‚Äôm being made that way by my own parents who‚Äôve turned into total totalitarians?‚Äù‚ÄúAt least Helen Keller couldn‚Äôt talk,‚Äù I said.Judy and Ruben are often at odds with one another throughout The Netanyahus, but perhaps the most regular contretemps is her longing for a nose job. This ever-pressing issue even makes its way into Judy‚Äôs college essays. When the prompt is the Platonic theme of ‚Äúfairness,‚Äù she writes with conviction, ‚ÄúAnd fairness must also be this: that everyone in this country who can pay for a nose with their own money can have one‚Äù (100). This debate comes to an explosive head in a heated conversation‚Äìand subsequent altercation‚Äìwith her grandfather, who is of a stringently conservative bent, insisting that Judy wear her nose with pride. But Blum‚Äôs father‚Äôs conservatism plays second fiddle to that of Netanyahu, who properly appears on the scene about halfway through the text. Benzion Netanyahu arrives with his wife and three children‚Äìwhom he neglected to announce‚Äìand proceeds to make a shambles of the Blum homestead. After some conjugal squabbling and general destruction by the aforementioned three terrors (one of whom remains in diapers at age seven), Blum and Netanyahu head over to Corbin: Netanyahu is to give a lecture as part of the application process. His area of expertise is antisemitism during the Spanish Inquisition, which figures in his disorganized and far-reaching lecture. After the class, Netanyahu notes that ‚ÄúSpeaking frankly, the specific period doesn‚Äôt matter to me as much as do the Jews, who for me are chiefly a vehicle for the study of how history is written‚Äù (175)‚Äìa bold claim, but perhaps grounded by biblical precedent. As for Blum‚Äôs own Jewishness, Netanyahu scorns it: Ruben's lack of cultural identity is anathema to the more zealous professor. In a conversation between the two, Netanyahu's strident view comes to the fore: ""This is what I think of American Jews‚Äìnothing"" (211). (Perhaps this is unfair, given his own desire to settle in America.) A page later, Netanyahu‚Äôs vitriol continues: ‚Äú[Y]ou have traded your birthright away for a bowl of plastic lentils‚Äù (212). He cannot sanction Blum‚Äôs assimilation to American culture‚Äìin it he sees the disregard of primogeniture and the cowardice of the weak. These feelings of high nationalism are unshared by the Blum family; in particular, Ruben‚Äôs wife Edith cannot abide them. Toward the end of The Netanyahus, she says frankly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick and tired of hearing about Jews‚Äù (216). Her attitude is again aptly captured on p. 217: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm getting older without convictions‚Ä¶‚Äù While Blum‚Äôs own feelings toward his Jewishness remain nebulous, he does not contradict her, acting the dutiful, listening husband. While The Netanyahus presents some probing questions of identity, it never strays too far into navel-gazing territory. This book has convinced me that Cohen is, in fact, a comic writer (but one unafraid to engage profound material). The prose flows like honey, reading effortlessly but never losing its intelligent edge‚Äìits learned wit (though Cohen‚Äôs lucubrations are masked by the sheer readability of the book). The Netanyahus is the apogee of what can be done with 200 pages."

Alla fine degli anni Cinquanta Bloom si trov√≤ a ospitare a Yale lo storico e agitatore del revisionismo sionista Benzion Netanyahu, con la moglie Tzila e tre bambini, due dei quali sarebbero entrati nella storia: Yonatan detto Yoni, che nel 1976 sarebbe morto a Entebbe diventando un martire dell‚Äôesercito israeliano, e soprattutto Benjamin detto Bibi, il pi√π longevo primo ministro della storia d‚ÄôIsraele e a tutt‚Äôoggi la figura politica pi√π influente del Paese.Diciamo che Cohen fa opera di fantasia e ricostruisce a piene mani la situazione, posizionando Blum (s√¨, non √® un errore ortografico) in una remota universit√† americana immersa nella neve, gli dona una figlia acutissima ma torturata da un naso possente di cui far√† di tutto per sbarazzarsi, e di una moglie iper colta annoiata del lavoro che le tocca, archivista nella biblioteca universitaria.√à come recita la quarta un campus novel, una lezione di storia, una lezione di religione nella storia, ma soprattutto, e questo √® il motivo che per me ha valso la lettura, un ironico e spiazzante quadro di vista domestica, in cui i coniugi Blum vengono soverchiati dalla qualunque (genitori ingombrantissimi, rettori ignoranti, ospiti imbarazzanti). E anche qui due lettere esilaranti (s√¨, le lettere come in Bellow e Richler). E ho riso davanti ad alcune scene di uno humour irresistibile, alla Woody Allen, direi.

39,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5," It's hard to believe that any literate person would have considered this book for a Pulitzer Prize. The story is amusing and inventive. What is inexcusable is the author's lack of historical knowledge regarding the year 1960. It's been mentioned elsewhere that an underpaid assistant professor would probably not have purchased that lovely console color tv that year, but there are a bunch of other blatantly improbable anachronisms. Here are a few: 1. Pump soap dispensers were not found in residential bathrooms. 2. An undergrad named Gary refers to himself as ""G-man"". 3. Disney sweaters. 4. A 7-year-old wearing a Pampers diaper. 5. Tipp-Ex was not on the market yet and probably not in use by college undergrads. 6. High-class visitors from New York City would not have unzipped their suitcase; suitcases had metal latches. "

The humour is good even though the slapstick at the end was a bit over the top. 4,5...I may round up in a few months' time"

It's obvious that Blum has been deputized solely because he is the only Jew on faculty, and the applicant is also Jewish. However, he and Ben-Zion Netanyahu have little in common. Blum and his family try to assimilate, while Netanyahu, who arrives with a wife and three wild boys in tow, is noticeably Jewish, and has toggled between the US and Israel. Events around his visit challenge Blum's sense of self.I liked parts of the novel very much - it has a lovely tart beginning and I especially enjoyed the succession of visits from Blum's in-laws and parents, followed by a heck of an incident with teenage daughter Judy, who hates her nose and wants surgery. The charm wore off for me in the latter third to a half, which was a weird mix of slapstick and academic exposition. The afterword explains the relationship between the novel and real events/characters, namely that Netanyahu was the father of today's Benjamin Netanyahu (who figures as one of the three young 'Yahus' who descend on the Blum household), and the events draw from a real-life visit to English prof Harold Bloom. My overall impression was that the story was very much enmeshed in a dialogue that I'm not part of or all that familiar with. "

44,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,Rating 3 out of 5,"Academics who obviously live a life focused around elite University campuses and go only to parties where everyone is employed as a university academic, or in some New York City cultural circles, write fiction like 'The Netanyahus'. Joshua Cohen's novel is centered around two scholarly Jews and their families, their minutely dissected but competing ideas about history and religion, and the job of being a university academic in a primarily Western Protestant college world. American academics or the academic-minded usually write fiction about university life like this one as a kind of slap(stick) about what, I guess, is how viciously academics really despise each other behind their walled gardens of high-minded intellectualism. I have read some other current literary authors popular with academia and the intelligentsia before, usually people who live around New England and that Motherland of White Tower novels, England. The English novels are more politely obscure in their plots and seemingly try very hard to appear unconscious of their class snobbery or of the fact that their books will be read only by intellectual literary snobs to the last page (or by the curious, or the sometimes self-taught wilders like me). American academic writers are more open about the class snobbery of intellectuals and write plots more aware that their subject matter is esoteric and stiflingly boring to most people. But the authors know they will get high praise in literary circles and maybe awards! What does it matter if the book only sells, perhaps, 30,000 copies, mostly to libraries?Frankly, if intellectual Jews are STILL going on and on (for millennia) with the arguments about what being Jewish is, about the hatreds within and without the world of Judiasm, about whether their sufferings are commanded by God, and about the right of Israel to be a Jewish Homeland, even if it is done by a jaundiced eye by a clever author, I am very disheartened. So. 'The Netanyahus' is boring for TWO reasons then. At least, for the seasoned readers.The true-believer myopia of all arguments and prejudices within religions is disheartening to me, actually, but especially those two-dimensional believers in the Abrahamic religions. The fact that many male demigogues are elected to office (or are given tenure) because they are populist theological demigogues is awful, too. I suppose laughing at everyone's manners and grossly myopic politics is all an author can do. I'm on Cohen's side on this. But why withhold the introduction of the Netanyahus until page 130, almost two-thirds into the novel? Cohen based this novel on a supposedly true anecdote about Ben-Zion Netanyahu, father of the Benjamin Netanyahu who is an infamous Israel politician. Cohen fills out the book with the backstory of Ben-Zion's ideas, why American academics embraced him as a university lecturer, and what Ben and his siblings were like as children. Although the book is an insider one humorously skewering academia and the being a token Jew among Eastern American Protestants, and how a second- and third-generation American Jew meeting an old-school European zionist Jew is shocked, especially by a zionist Jew with a unique acceptance of intolerance and hate because they believe intolerance and hate are a Good to be encouraged (on several levels), I found the book yet another meta-literary conversation of yet another Jewish generation going over the same ground again. On one hand, it's good that conversation is happening, on the other, it's horrible the conversation is happening again. No religion, even one of the oldest Abrahamic ones, can stop disputing viewpoints of what a believer should believe, and political infighting again cycles and recycles generation after generation. Hilariously sad."

It's an experience I imagine was shared by readers who keep an eye to book prizes. Typically I've heard of the winner before it's announced, but it was a treat to have an introduction through the prize. The style and density of the novel makes it a bit of a Pulitzer anomaly in my mind, but I can also see how the committee would want to highlight such a unique novel.The Netanyahus is a fictionalized version of a second-hand account of a visit from the world's worst house guests. While the eponymous family definitely takes centre stage in the later half of the novel, the main theme asks what it means to be an American Jew. The reader is led through the proceedings by Dr. Blum, a history professor at a mediocre university, who struggles with his family and identity. Now, had the novel been only the riotously funny social encounters I'm sure I would have been entirely enamoured with the whole thing. However, there's patches of oratory, exposition, and history that are bolstered with a thesaurus worth of diction making for some exceedingly dense passages. I struggled through these bits having very little footing in the historical plight of the Jewish people outside of the 20th and 21st centuries. I definitely learned some things, but I think I would have enjoyed it more had I come prepared for hefty passages of, essentially, nonfiction. Having read two Pulitzer Prize winners for fiction in as many months, I much prefer Cohen's quirky and wordy romp to Louise Erdrich's The Night Watchman. There's an undeniable charm to Cohen's thick writing and the ending is a laugh-out-loud affair that had me in stitches. In the end, pretty darned good, but not easy."

Il romanzo di Cohen viene definito (in seconda di copertina) un ""campus novel, una commedia dissacrante, una lezione di storia, una conferenza accademica, una polemica sul sionismo, una riflessione sui conflitti culturali e religiosi degli ebrei americani e sulle vulnerabilit√† dei discorsi identitari"": forse troppo, ma in ogni caso il libro √® buono e l'autore, premiato con il Pulitzer 2022 per la narrativa, merita ulteriori attenzioni e letture."

Forse si tratta della confluenza in queste pagine di due generi, o meglio sottogeneri, a me poco graditi come il ‚Äúcampus novel‚Äù cio√® un racconto che si svolge interamente in un campus universitario americano con dinamiche, personaggi, ambienti fin troppo sfruttati, e il romanzo incentrato sull‚Äôebraismo in tutte le sue sfaccettature. Un tema, quest‚Äôultimo, che ho ben accolto e apprezzato come componente imprescindibile della prosa travolgente di un narratore della consistenza di Philip Roth (che pure non lesinava prolungate dissertazioni in materia), di un Saul Bellow o di un Bernard Malamud, ma che qui invece mi ha piuttosto estenuato, enunciato come √® con i canoni e i ritmi di un saggio molto pi√π che di una narrazione.Oppure il mio scarso entusiasmo √® dovuto a ragioni puramente soggettive, accentuate da una ‚Äúcollettiva‚Äù che sto affrontando in contemporanea e che, al contrario del romanzo di Cohen, mi avvince e assorbe profondamente le mie energie mentali. A distrarmi dalla lettura di ‚ÄúI Netanhyaus‚Äù ha contribuito la scelta dell‚Äôautore di mettere in scena la famiglia che produrr√† uno scossone decisivo nella tranquilla vita del narratore e nelle pagine del romanzo ben oltre la met√† della narrazione; tutto ci√≤ che precede si consuma in un‚Äôattesa prolungata intervallata da racconti e riflessioni sulla carriera del protagonista Ruben Blum e sul passato dei familiari, meditazioni costantemente pervase da ossessioni persecutorie sull‚Äôantisemitismo pi√π o meno consapevole da parte degli interlocutori.Quando Ben-Zion Netanyahu, con la sua ingombrante famiglia, finalmente irrompe nel libro, il romanzo prende quota, si fa interessante nel conflitto, peraltro quasi tutto in punta di fioretto (sono docenti universitari dopotutto‚Ä¶), fra il mite ebreo statunintense che anela all‚Äôassimilazione e l‚Äôaggressivo israeliano sionista continuamente pervaso dalla natura tragica del destino ebraico. Il conflitto/confronto assume anche caratteri ironici e satirici, con punte di esplicita comicit√† per il comportamento spiazzante e invadente dei nuovi arrivati e l‚Äôimbarazzato atteggiamento di un Blum conciliante o fin troppo condiscendente, come gli viene non a torto rinfacciato dalla moglie esausta.Questo √® quanto; ho tralasciato, poich√© a mio avviso ininfluente sulla narrazione, il fatto che il personaggio di Ruben sia ritagliato sulla figura dell‚Äôeminente critico Harold Bloom (che narr√≤ l‚Äôepisodio a Joshua Cohen), e che uno dei figli Netanyahu sia l‚Äôattuale primo ministro di Israele, individuo oggi detestabile ma che nel romanzo non √® che un bambino, irrequieto come tutti i decenni‚Ä¶"

I don‚Äôt think American Jews are sad and sorry, so can I accept that this book is a chance for a (mean-spirited or meaningful?) riff on Bibi‚Äôs parents? No, b/c not a single Jew here (in the book), from university Jews to religious Jews to New York Jews to Israeli Jews (academic or warriors) is happy or sympathetic. They push intractable ideas about the Spanish Inquisition (actually an interesting part of the book, also the Jabotinsky history), they rue their noses, they hustle for jobs, they try to be like the New Englanders, they are embarrassed. Reviewers say they laughed ‚Äì it was hilarious! it was madcap! - but even at 1.4x speed it couldn‚Äôt be over fast enough for me. I wonder what the other Bloom (Harold, RIP) would think about it.

58,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9281934-louise,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is certainly in the firmament of fellow Pulitzer Prize winners Philip Roth, Bernard Malamud, and Saul Bellow. It goes beyond satire of Jewish American family life, it takes on academia and the background of Israel‚Äôs (contemporary to its publication) Prime Minister. The challenge is not just for the writer, but for also the reader. The setting is a university in New York State‚Äôs Finger Lakes region. In Roth style, the narrator, Professor Ruben Blum, presents his in-laws, his parents, wife and his wildly independent daughter who obsesses over the lump in her nose. Ruben notes his role in Corbindale where he, his wife and daughter are the only Jews. Realizing how harshly they will be judged, he and his wife interact very carefully in the community.The laugh out loud stars right away. On p. 2 Blum describes his discipline is ‚Äútaxation studies‚Äù a field he ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù since other specialties were crowded. He researches ‚ÄúAntiquity‚Äôs development of customs, duties and tariffs all the way back to the Rosetta Stone and even the Bible, both of which‚Ä¶ are substantially just tax documents‚Äù. He goes on about his research and publications such that it sounds almost real. (On p. 76 Blum quotes a letter, couched in academic parlance, from a ‚ÄúLecturer in Assyriology, Aryanology and Indo-European Linguistics and Philology‚Äù.)Anyone familiar with office politics in academia will love how Dr. Morse ‚Äúnever developed a deep European bench‚Äù and conversations on how the budget will drive curricular (hiring) decisions. Then, there is the conversation where Rubin is told he was selected to host a ‚ÄúJewish historian‚Äù who is an applicant for a budget compromised position. If you are laughing out loud at the family scenes you will fall over when the Netanyahu‚Äôs arrive. While their final events are too way out, the subtle and overt satire will shock you, when you realize the middle child will serve as Israel‚Äôs Prime Minister for 15 years.In the end, Cohen says his inspiration for this was a conversation with Harold Bl00m, who did interview the senior Netanyahu. Cohen produces a letter from Bloom's daughter who has no comment for the book, but was said to be present at the time time when her father hosted the real Netanyaho family.. It is hard to tell if the letter is real or continues the satire.If you are a fan of Roth, Malamud and/or Bellow you will not want to miss this. If you enjoy a good satire, you will like it especially if you are steeped in academia or 1950's Jewish American culture. If you are steeped in Israeli politics, it probably depends what your politics are."

But it would have been so much funnier if the scholarship were not over my head. I envy the laughs of people more educated than I and especially people who work in academia.The 1960 college campus novel is based on a true incident when Ben-Zion Netanyahu, father of the embattled Bibi of current history, auditioned to teach at a small American college (the nonfiction is detailed in an afterword). Meeting the senior Netanyahu in this zany story, I sense a new understanding of the attraction between the Fabulist Orange Guy and the son of the ridiculously pompous and demanding Bogus Historian from Israel. And particularly brilliant‚Äîno matter your education‚Äîis the scene when Netanyahu and his miserable wife and three sons invade and decimate the home of the protagonist narrator, Ruben Blum, a beleaguered Jewish historian (take note, as the book does: the guy is Jewish, but not an expert in Jewish history) who is doing what he must to get tenure and therefore accepts his assignment to serve on a hiring committee and host Netanyahu simply because he (Ruben) is the only Jew on campus. This is comedy writing at its best.That said, my biggest laugh came early on page 25 when Rubin‚Äôs department head, Dr. Morse, introduces this ridiculous assignment: The rest of our conversation was logistics, followed by Dr. Morse attempting to pronounce the candidate‚Äôs name and me failing to understand him‚ÄîI was getting Bento Nehru, Benzedrine Nakamoto, Benzene Natty Yahoo . . .In ConclusionI loved the laughs, but my biggest frustration reading this sometimes esoteric comedy is that, because I cannot swim (will not? am not up to the task?) in academic discourses that use as many words as the author can think like the myriad matrices of rapid streams coalescing into a roiling ocean (this is me pretending to be an academic), I could not decipher the no-doubt brilliant meaning about the nature of revisionist history vis-a-vis Jewish anything and the notion of objective history, which appeared to be an important theme under all the hilarity. I got lost and feel cheated because I missed something I would actually like to know.(Please don‚Äôt be daunted by this last paragraph. This book is not a slog. I finished it in two days and there is plenty of nonesoteric human nonsense that will appeal to nonacademics like moi.)"

Es lo que yo suelo llamar un artefacto de efecto retardado: la lectura puede ser m√°s o menos entretenida pero no intensa o espectacular (en plan Denis Johnson) y no es hasta que le das un par de vueltas que descubres que ha sido una experiencia especial y por encima de convencional.As√≠ que desando el camino y en breve adjuntar√© el comentario propiamente dicho.Gracias por la paciencia, buscad a Los Netanyahus, robadla, compradla, leedla. Tiene humor e inteligencia, si es que ambos t√©rminos no son ya sin√≥nimos.*** *** ***Escrib√≠ en ese primer esbozo, y vuelvo a afirmar ahora, que Los Netanyahus me confirma el gran talento de Joshua Cohen, principalmente en su destreza para tejer un lenguaje tan flexible como preciso en los t√©rminos que aborda, ya sean hist√≥ricos, pol√≠ticos o psicol√≥gicos, una lengua que maneja con una soltura notoria y que logra que el cauce de su narraci√≥n discurra con una fluidez ejemplar.En apariencia se nos presentan retales de la t√≠pica comedia jud√≠a d√≥nde encontramos familias con relaciones algo neur√≥ticas y de refinada tiran√≠a, posteriormente muda y descubrimos otra comedia de invitados indeseables, todo ello entretejido con una novela de campus, en la que no faltan disputas internacionales entre acad√©micos que liman sus rivalidades conspirando unos contra otros, adem√°s de ofrecer una visi√≥n de la jerarqu√≠a acad√©mica como una especie de corte que atesora sus peque√±as y mezquinas miserias.Pero el meollo en verdad reside en el oficio de Historiadores tanto de Ruben Blum como Ben-zion Netanyahu. Si lo he entendido bien, Cohen establece un paralelismo entre estas dos figuras, un paralelismo con resonancias pol√≠ticas, d√≥nde Blum ser√≠a el reformista y Netanyahu el revolucionario. Una indagaci√≥n a prop√≥sito de la identidad jud√≠a, a la cual Cohen pertenece, en la cual Blum prefiere la integraci√≥n silenciosa y tranquila y Netanyahu por contra prefiere construir una imagen omnipotente de s√≠ mismo, gasta una actitud prepotente y avasalladora y no escatima en autoelogios, lleg√°ndose a portar como si el mundo al completo le debiera algo de forma permanente. Netanyahu forma parte de una escisi√≥n radical del sionismo, que empez√≥ como una cosa y que ha acabado por ser percibida como un movimiento fundamentalista, que apuesta en tomar las cosas por la fuerza y por hacer prevalecer los derechos hist√≥ricos que hipot√©ticamente concede la Tor√°. Precisamente en esa fusi√≥n de Teolog√≠a e Historia se centra la idea de la reescritura a conveniencia de la Historia por parte de intereses particulares, de una clase dominante, de un grupo social, etc√©tera. En la escena de la reuni√≥n del claustro de profesores, d√≥nde deben evaluar la viabilidad de la candidatura de Netanyahu como profesor adjunto, cuando uno de los catedr√°ticos, un hombre muy conservador, reniega de ""los rojos"" que quieren modificar la Historia y convertir a ""los h√©roes en tiranos y a la ciudadan√≠a en v√≠ctima"", dando a entender que una vez establecida, a los que sufren la Historia no les queda m√°s remedio que abnegarse a sus consecuencias. Es otro punto de vista, sin duda, para el cual hay que tener una confianza casi ciega en las clases dominantes. Bajo ese punto de vista tambi√©n han aparecido maravillosas teor√≠as en la que vienen a decirnos que la Inquisici√≥n era un tribunal estupendo, muy garantista, que mataron poco y persiguieron a pocos jud√≠os en comparaci√≥n con el c√≥mputo hist√≥rico y universal. Otra visi√≥n torticera, ¬øpor qu√© ha de resultar m√°s fiable o leg√≠tima? En verdad, esto se responde desde cada generaci√≥n o cada grupo. La novela de Cohen pone el foco en la reescritura del sionismo revisionista, pero al estar narrada desde el tiempo presente, como unas memorias, y menciona tambi√©n los contempor√°neos movimientos universitarios que incluyen no pocas cancelaciones, creaci√≥n de espacios seguro y dem√°s hierbas.Joshua Cohen es uno de esos escritores que prefieren disimular sus referencias, si bien las resonancias de Kafka se perciben claras en su melod√≠a. Este Ruben Blum, m√°s o menos un trasunto de Harold Bloom, en no pocos momentos se transforma en Josef K, azorado frente a un proceso incognoscible, atrapado por el frente dom√©stico y por el acad√©mico, con un Ben-Zion Netanyahu que representa todo lo que a √©l le falta. Un clima de refinada pesadilla en la que Blum experimenta sus carencias, pues √©l parece m√°s descre√≠do y con ganas de llevar una vida tranquila, mientras que Netanyahu, en cierta forma su antagonista, que no duda en posicionarse de la forma m√°s notoria posible, vendi√©ndose como una figura imponente y respetable, desde√±ando sin contemplaciones las opiniones contrarias o que sencillamente no le agradan. Netanyahu vive para trabajar y Blum trabaja para vivir.Reuniendo las dos lecturas que he realizado de la obra de Joshua Cohen, me doy que la discusi√≥n contra el fundamentalismo sionista, aunque no desde la perspectiva palestina, si no desde dentro de la cultura jud√≠a, ocupa una parte fundamental en sus historias, donde tambi√©n esboza las diferentes posiciones. En ese sentido, la carta que un acad√©mico israel√≠, rival de Netanyahu, env√≠a a Blum para advertirle qu√© clase de personaje es el doctor Netanyahu, ilustra esta divisi√≥n y divergencia de posiciones dentro de un mismo movimiento. A eso, por supuesto, tambi√©n se a√±ade otra externa, la del propio Blum, para quien el juda√≠smo es una serie de ritos familiares y sociales, pero no forma parte de la vida pol√≠tica.No hay duda que el libro se presta a sacarle todav√≠a m√°s punta, va m√°s all√° del tiempo de lectura, no se trata solamente de la dieg√©tica, de desgranar la trama y se acab√≥. Sin duda Cohen es lo bastante l√∫cido como para detallar cada postura y luego ceder la interpretaci√≥n al lector, todo esto conducido por una voz ir√≥nica pero no fr√≠vola, ducha pero no pedante, en verdad da la sensaci√≥n que domina el material con la intenci√≥n de transmitir la sensaci√≥n que habla del tema desde dentro, como si sus personajes fuesen gente que √©l ha conocido. Relativamente esto tambi√©n es cierto, pues como se sabe y he mencionado, alguno de estos personajes parten de modelos reales y la an√©cdota de la visita a la universidad por parte de Netanyahu, padre del corrupto Benjamin Netanyahu, en verdad le ocurri√≥ a Harold Bloom. Esta capacidad para refinar y transmutar materiales reales, para convertirlos en ficci√≥n y materia de reflexi√≥n, demuestra a Cohen como un narrador muy dotado, y a la vez confirma que de las cosas serias s√≥lo se puede hablar en broma."
61,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"This was one of the most disappointing books I have ever read. There is so much wrong with it, I don't even know where to begin. The sneaky, dishonest mixture of fact and fiction, the nasty, petty zingers against a dead person who is no longer around to fire back (I have no love for the Netanyahu family, so this is not some personal defense of a friend or someone I admire), the pretentious usage of Hebrew, Yiddish, German, French, and Spanish words, shockingly often with errors in meaning and nuance (where were the editors and copy-editors?), and the self-important deployment of ""big words"" that leave the reader with the impression that the author wrote this just to impress, with a thesaurus on his lap. The entire book seems like the author's engineered effort to create some Philip Roth - Woody Allen - Harold Bloom (yes, we get it, you two were close...) identity among literary giants, but it falls pathetically flat. Even in its funny passages, the book fails to be funny (unlike, say, Shalom Auslander's Foreskin's Lament). How this book won the Pulitzer Prize is beyond me. If there is one (and only one) upside to reading it, it's that I'll never again feel compelled to read a book because it won a Pulitzer."

It just keeps going. It‚Äôs got plenty of tone. It's all tone. Even with its changes of narrative style, it manages to keep that tone going. Here‚Äôs a little sampler that offers some of the ironic beauty, elevated prose and comic absurdity: Consider these stories: A band of across the border desperados threaten a ranch and a lone gunslinger is warily hired to despatch them, paid a bounty with the last of a sweetheart prostitute‚Äôs dusty nuggets‚Ä¶ a tribe of savage Apache attack a wagon train of honest Christian missionaries who must compromise with violence‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not saying these stories had an outsize influence on the future direction of the Netanyahu boys, so much as I‚Äôm saying they had an outsize influence on everyone at the time. And anyway, when I put on my galoshes, blew a kiss to Edith she refused to lasso in, and I left the hacienda amid the giddyups and crack of gunshots, the association I had was with the father himself, Ben-Zion, and frankly with eth visiting lecturers and guest professors of all kinds, those solitary marksmen who wander as strangers from town to town, itinerant in habit, itinerant in mind, burning with the need to live down their pasts and prove their strength to the cruel and hostile locals. I could‚Äôve chosen many others. It‚Äôs an anecdote, so it doesn‚Äôt need to be true; an embellishment, so it doesn‚Äôt need to stick hard to facts. Well, it doesn‚Äôt bother with facts. It‚Äôs apocrypha, based on a story told by an ageing Harold Bloom to his young friend, the author Joshua Cohen. THE Harold Bloom. So it maybe happened, so there may be a primary text it‚Äôs based on, certainly a coda appears at the end of the book as though it is the primary text of that conversation with Harold Bloom. But in the end I didn't care. Because this book is one enormous hoot of a book. That's all that mattered. I‚Äôm so glad the Pulitzers thought it was a good idea to award it the big prize recently. (Later addition)My name is Ruben Blum and I‚Äôm an, yes, an historian. Soon enough, though, I guess I‚Äôll be historical. By which I mean I‚Äôll die and become history myself‚Ä¶‚ÄùRuben Blum starts with a fatalistic truth of it all, that he is inevitably about to tell us about the Netanyahus he encountered. The Netanyahus. Who are they? Well, they are the family made famous by the previous Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin (Benny) Netanyahu. His brother Jonathan was made famous by Benny after dying at the Entebbe hostage assault. The father, the Jewish scholar rabbi Benzion Netanyahu is as mad as a cut snake (my interpretation as it may not fit hard facts outside of fiction) as we say down south. He‚Äôs got a long book on the go about Jews in Inquisition Spain. He‚Äôs trying to get an academic job somewhere. These may all be facts, but they kind of get in the way of good story-telling. So they aren‚Äôt mentioned, except for the 1400 page magnus opus of the father which he talks about at length in a letter. He‚Äôs kind of desperate, lugging his large family of boys around the world in the meantime. He ends up in one of those little liberal art colleges in the USA, you know the ones with picturesque houses, deciduous trees, lots of wood panelling and fine east-coast manners (made famous as a setting for humour by Nabokov). The college has one Jew, the narrator Ruben Blum. He gets to read the application for a lecture from Mr Netanyahu. The polite new Englanders really don‚Äôt know how to deal with the Jew, so they give the task over to the Jew in residence. So after some positive noise and acceptance, the entourage arrives on a dreadful winter‚Äôs day. The Netanyahus have nowhere to stay, the boys are semi-civilised and trash their hosts place in an atavistic manner. (A very funny and indecent scene) After all, teenage boys ARE teenage boys. And yes Yahu sound like Yahoo! So remember Jonathan Swift. There may be some serious elements in the book, so look out for them. On my list is how not to raise boys; racism can be very subtle when it‚Äôs to your face, how deep does tribal allegiance run, it‚Äôs not family after all, but it comes close and mid-century American automobiles can offer comedic possibilities."
68,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41305720-jarrett-neal,Rating 5 out of 5,"Discussions regarding The Netanyahus revolve around two questions: 1) Why did this under-the-radar novel win the Pultizer Prize, and 2) Is it any good. The quality and literary merit of The Netanyahus has garnered both praise and ire. A BookTuber whose channel I've been following for several years recently uploaded an exoricating review of the novel that you can view here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSS6e.... Challenging as this novel may be for some readers, I found Joshua Cohen's seemless blend of fiction, nonfiction, history, religion, and politics masterfully executed. The result is an enthralling text that links the past to the present in stunning fashion.At its core, The Netanyahus is a campus novel but its forays into dense academic prose will try some readers' patience. I went all in for those sections and unlike other readers I took delight in happening upon those hundred-dollar SAT words Cohen sprinkled throughout the text (more on that later). Ruben Blum, the narrator, is a man perplexed by his private life and his professional circumstances as the only Jewish faulty member at a small liberal arts college in New York state. Practically strongarmed into hosting Ben-Zion Netanyahu, who hopes to land a teaching position at Ruben's college, Ruben is like a spindly tree in a hurricane when Netanyahu and his family arrive at his home, a meeting that forces Ruben to wrestle with Jewish history and solidarity, the purpose of education, anti-Semitism, masculinity, and a whirlwind of other issues. The Netanyahus may be a challenging book, and Cohen, much like Netanyahu, does not apologize for his erudition or endeavor to simplify his text to make it more accessible to readers. I truly admire that. In an era where so many literary fiction offerings have the same MFA workshop burnish to them, it's refreshing to encounter a book that puts demands on readers. This is espeically true in Cohen's diction. Folks, you will absolutely need to keep a dictionary close at hand when you read this book. As wide as my vocabulary is, even I was knocked sideways by the language. But I loved coming across those words; they kept me active in the reading, as if I were hunting for treasure. I'm glad that in this current trend of literary minimalism, Cohen has the guts to force readers to take the job of reading seriously and raise stakes for us. Anyone who thinks Cohen choice of words is pretentious or snobbish should just avoid this book.But it is also important to remember that Cohen is writing out of a long tradition of Jewish literature, encompassing Philip Roth to Saul Bellow to Adam Levin and others. Long, digressive stories are par for the course, and internecine questions regarding Jews' place in society and their commitment to the community expand the corpus of Jewish literature. Did The Netanyahus derseve to win the Pulitzer Prize? I believe so, but that doesn't mean there weren't plenty of other books that could easily have taken the win (personally, I thought it was going to go to Crossroads by Jonathan Franzen, a similar novel released in 2021). Awards are about many things. The timeliness of The Netanyahus' release, just around the time Benjamin Netanyahu had been removed from office only to be reinstated months later, says a great deal. Love it or hate it, this novel captures an important moment in history, and in a strange way it does so twice."

75,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30178291-fraser-simons,Rating 4 out of 5,"A highly Academic comedy in which the caricatures of a hedonistic most literal of all Zionists is invited to interview at a backwoods school for a history position, and the only Jew Americanist is required to subject himself (by way of cajoling from the institution) to being on the committee reviewing the application, as well as the actual hosting of the ideologically opposed, perhaps soon-to-be colleague. While most of the humour comes from the conception‚Äîat least for me‚Äîit does dip into absurdism. Predominately to accentuate how even in the 1950s campus life had similar polarization of politics and how revisionists were well and truly spotted back then. Given what we now know about the now normalized, once actually absurd revisionist movement the absurd individual that is the Netanyahus absolutely are, pioneering the Israeli state‚Äîthe fact that this anecdote from Harold Bloom‚Äôs life is itself undergone revisionist history in the form of this book, revising the father of revisionism while also subtly (most of the time) showing the do-nothing attitudes leading to that end goal as forgone, but also the anti-semitism steeped in that movement aimed at any Jewish peoples against the movement, is really pretty deft. And where the humour primarily stems from.Now, this said, there‚Äôs also just wild events that occur to make it clear that no character is depicted fairly remotely to reality, other than their ideology. There‚Äôs no slip-sliding on that front. That makes it particularly biting while retaining the low brow wit that breaks tension. Heck, even whether or not a particularly funny sex scene takes place is answered with a plumb, if you infer, in the credits and more credits section. Had I been more into the text. By that I mean, educated on the subjects it speaks intelligently about, I think I‚Äôd probably have gotten much more out of it. But the strength of the writing propelled me anyway. And there is, quite literally, a history lesson. The prose do weaken somewhat when it shifts to the framing of the actual arrival of the Netanyahus though. Our man is less razor sharp and playful with diction, which was the primarily enjoyment until I skated to what made this piece funny at a structural, conceptual level. Especially because the formatting is fairly academic as well: Thick, meaty paragraphs that can go on for pages glide much faster in the first third of the book. The more granular it gets with history, and you have to really hunker down to internalize it, it does creep to a crawl. Will not be to everyone‚Äôs taste. In that way it might be a deft slight of hand, shifting to that. But I think I‚Äôd prefer have had the voice maintain throughout. Combined with the niche quality of the high brow humour, it‚Äôs probably not got much of a chance to blow me away. Even to a layman, however, very enjoyable."

It is narrated by Reuben Blum, a historian who is also the first Jew ever to be hired at Corbin College. Since Reuben is Jewish, he is asked by his department chair to serve on the hiring committee that will interview Ben-Zion Netanyahu, an Israeli scholar of medieval Jewry and the Spanish Inquisition, for a position at Corbin. Through a wacky turn of events, Blum and his wife and daughter also end up hosting Netanyahu along with his wife and three boys at their home. I quite enjoyed all of the juxtapositions in this novel - Jews and WASPs, Americans and Israelis, assimilationist Jews and political Jews, older and younger generations, academics and non-academics, etc. I really loved one scene that occurs before the Netanyahus appear when Reuben's father is having a discussion with his granddaughter Judy about one of her college application essays. The topic of the essay is fairness, and on this point, he says, ""In America, they tell you to [assimilate], and in return, you get fairness. That's the deal. And so you change it all and then go to collect this fairness you were promised but all the offices where you make your claim are closed, because this country never holds up its half of the bargain"" (104).Would recommend if you enjoy campus/academic novels, fiction that blends together different genres, political or literary fiction, and/or have an interest in contemporary Jewish American literature."

But even when moments in the book are sharp or melancholy, they keep an undertone of witty and ironic observation.

Not without slips ( a nose gets fixed in a slapstick scene) but who cares?Blum is a professor at a small college and his being Jewish is of prime importance - not just to his colleagues. . Often I transposed the faces of the actors from the Marvelous Mrs Maisel onto the characters - a compliment to both. Blum is assigned to accompany around campus a candidate for a teaching job - Ben Zion Netanyahu. (Not lost is the college assigning a Jew to shepherd a Jew) Bibi is one of the three boys who wreck havoc - their mother a force of nature, their father a zealot. All of this born from Cohen‚Äôs relationship with Harold Bloom who had in real life met and survived the Netanyahu family.

86,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"The funniest book I've read since perhaps The Sellout, the language was also superbly crafted from the very first page, and it all very thought provoking as well.The book is a fictionalized account of a real event: Ben-Zion Netanhayu's visit to Cornell for a job talk in the 1960. This was not, however, any job talk as the University found their only Jewish professor and put him on the search committee even though it was outside his area, had him host Netanyahu, who ends up without telling anyone showing up with his wife and three bratty children (one of whom is Bibi Netanyahu). Joshua Cohen uses a fictional stand-in for Cornell and the Cornell professor (although all is eventually revealed), but draws realistically from Ben-Zion Netanyahu's biography and scholarship, and then presumably makes up an awful lot else.The Netanyahus fits into the genre of campus novel with its slightly satirical and amused descriptions of the minutiae and silliness of the practices on campus, who serves on what committee, who teaches what, which department gets the resources, etc. But it does it while also depicting American Jews in the late 1950s, the conflict between religion (on one side of the family) and secularism (on the other), the combination of anti-semitism, tokenism, and just well-meaning people unsure how to behave, and the like.And then into this we hear a little about Netanyahu, then we get a glowing portrait of him from a recommendation letter that is printed in full, and then we get a more candid and negative portrayal, and finally the character himself enters and he is a bully, a brute, and the rest of his family members are even worse, and yet his Jewish host is meek and permissive in the face of them, unable to stand up to any of it until it goes to extreme lengths.As such it also fits into the genre of Jewish comic novels, with Cohen stylizing himself (and referring to) the tradition of Bernard Malamud, Saul Bellow, and Philip Roth with humor that is both a combination of outrageous, things that should not have been said, and also a meek way of deflecting and avoiding confrontation with the problems of the world.Mostly, however, the book is pure fun, funniness, and delightful writing from the first page to the last."

This book combines several things very skillfully, managing to be thoughtful and perceptive and also just wildly hilarious in its depiction of the ungovernable Netanyahus as they descend like a whirlwind on a small New York state college. [There‚Äôs added pleasure in learning from the author‚Äôs afterword that this is a thinly veiled, fictionalized account of the real-life 1960 encounter between future academic luminary Harold Bloom and Jewish historian Benzion Netanyahu (father of Benjamin ‚ÄúBibi‚Äù Netanyahu, future Prime Minister of Israel), visiting Bloom‚Äôs college to interview for a teaching post.]Ruben Blum is a young history professor hoping for tenure at a small New York college in a completely white-bread town. He is the only Jewish employee at the college, faculty or staff, and he and his family are the only Jews in town. Ruben is subject to the constant ‚Äúgenteel‚Äù anti-Semitism of colleagues, and the latest example is that he‚Äôs not only been reluctantly co-opted to serve on the hiring committee to assess the candidacy of a Jewish historian (and historian of the Jews in medieval Spain, especially during the Inquisition) but has also been dragooned into hosting him. Benzion shows up unexpectedly accompanied by his bellicose wife and equally aggressive three sons, and they all quickly proceed to trash the Blum‚Äôs home. Netanyahu‚Äôs sample lesson to a Bible-studies class and public lecture (both part of the hiring process) are very interesting and illuminating (to this reader anyway) but jaw-droppingly ill-suited for a hopeful job candidate. (Talk about shooting yourself in the foot.) And so it goes.There is academic satire aplenty, family dynamics, looks in at the struggle to found a Jewish state, medieval history, the post-war assimilationist bent of middle-class American Jews, especially as contrasted with Netanyahu‚Äôs insistence that the world is relentlessly anti-Semitic and inherently unsafe for Jews. There‚Äôs a lot to unpack in a shortish serio-comic novel, but Cohen puts it all together masterfully. "

It's a campus novel that is properly funny. Perhaps the funniest since Lucky Jim. It's also very specifically about the nature of Jewishness in America at the start of the 1960s. Perhaps parallels could be drawn with Jewishness in America today and its relation to unapologetic, right-wing Israel. In 1960 a Jew in America is trying to keep his head down and fly under the radar until he is reminded of his otherness and embarrassed by the crassness of an Israeli. I guess that may resonate for some in the here and now.Calling the book ""The Netanyahus"" is mere sleight of hand. You are looking in one direction while something else entirely is going on. Something richer and more rewarding. Of course there is enough early Zionist history and outright ridiculing of the young Bibi to satisfy people who turned up for the title, but the focus of the novel is the assimilating diaspora Jew, not the Zionist in exile."

I admit I find this shift of meaning to be inspiring: a word that originally meant a tempering of radical doctrine for purpose of compromise went on to mean a dangerous threat to established order.""Netanyahu plays the perfect antagonist as he comes across as a snarky know it all, with a victim mentality. He is a perfect contrast to Blum who tries to see fairness and possibility to not live in history repeating itself when it comes to the Jewish people. We learn about Jewish history and the Zionist movement and the differing sects within it.""But the past doesn't have to be the future. That's the point of something you aspire to.""The Netanyahus by Joshua Cohen is a humorous and intellectual take on themes post war American life and the Jewish diaspora. Joshua Cohen has a way with words, and the ability to make one think and laugh out loud, sometimes at the same time. Though the story went kind of off the rails near the end, I found myself intellectually stimulated and pleasantly entertained by The Netanyahus. If you're looking for stirring syntax, a good laugh while learning something, you can't go wrong with this Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Joshua Cohen. ""What else is salient? I wish I knew. But do we ever know?""""I'd like to think my profession has made me more attuned than most to the selective use of facts and the way that each age and ideological movement manages to cobble together its own tailormade chronicles to suit its aims and glatter its self-conceptions.""""The past was merely the process by which the present was attained, and the present merely the most current stage of the American superlative, to be overtaken by tomorrow's liberation and capital's spread, until the ultimate transfiguration of world history into world democracy.""""The plunger gave gasps like wet flatulence.""""She had that smart cruelty of someone who'd gotten what she wanted. And she'd gotten it the fairest way, through suffering.""""I asked whether you think it's fair that by making a study of your faith, you lose it?""""Perhaps I should just conclude with the antagonism between the belief that history never repeats itself and the belief that it always repeats itself, in the very circular eternity of this table.""""History treats time as a chain of happenings that we humans set into motion by our own free will: its first lesson is that a first cause does not exist because, as my teachers put it back in public school, we learn history in order to learn how to change it. Theology, however, treats time as a chain of changes that are visited down upon us by the will of God, Who makes things occur for reasons of His own- Who brings about alterations and modifications in the fabric of existence not haphazardly, but according to a mystical scheme or pattern that can't be humanly interpreted as anything but miraculous, or as a punishment, we've earned in retribution for our sins.""""It felt as if by doing so, I was holding my own history in check; I was blocking out the past, those lost old hoarse-cricket voices of the basement rabbis from long long ago, who with the infelicity and stiffness of another foreigner's thesaurusized English were murmur- ing again-warning me against complacency... warning me against America.""""In an environment like this-in an understimulated environment where the only stimulus besides your own blockage is the mediocrity of your colleagues-survival can be difficult. Ignorance is a subtler enemy than vulgar xenophobia. Because it's the enemy within, requiring no demagoguery to stir it up. No uniforms. No rifles. Nothing incendiary. Just a job, a job title, a college. It's latent in the college. You dedicate your life to knowledge and your society can only reward you by placing you in an institution. And yet the real tragedy is that you yourself regard this as a reward, being placed behind high stone walls in the midst of the woods, where you can't hurt anyone, where you can only hurt yourself. Frankly it's a miracle that not everyone has committed suicide.""""The earliest Zionist Congresses were split between these polar- opposite positions-between the ""political"" ""evolutionary"" Zionism of the West, and the ""practical"" ""revolutionary"" Zionism of the East, whose disagreements centered on geography and method: the ques- tions of whether a land or the land should be negotiated for or seized.""""All of us are born how we are born and suffer how we suffer and if even God can't make us equal who are we to think our laws can?"" He prodded the spoon against a bunched rill in the tablecloth. ‚ÄúOr maybe God doesn't want us to be equal.""""Maybe.'""""That's the deal. And so you can change it all and then go to collect this fairness you were promised but all the offices where you make your claim are closed, because this country never holds up its half of the bargain. And even if it does, even if it treats you fairly by accident maybe, or maybe only by treating someone else next to you more unfair and you feel better when you compare yourself, there will still always come some problem that fairness can't solve, and the moment it does, everyone jumps overboard from the sinking ship and rushes back to the people they came from.""""So that's your argument against fairness? Seriously? That because death is unfair, we can be too? That we can cheat others because life cheats us?"""

The two most enjoyable scenes involved, first, the protagonist's hilariously judgmental in-laws visiting his house, critiquing every piece of furniture and decor. Second, when the Netanyahu family finally arrives in the novel, on p. 135. Protagonist Ruben Blum teaches history at a middling upstate New York college. Because he's the only Jew on campus, he is assigned to welcome the new Israeli professor Benzion Netanyahu, who arrives with his wife and three young sons. The whole family is horrific. It's snowing outside but they refuse to take off their shoes when asked; they stain the carpet, grab up knick-knacks, bang on the piano, 7-year-old Iddo rubs fireplace ashes on his face, mother Tzila lays him on a tray table to change his diaper as brother Benjamin finger-flicks his penis, then because they have no fresh underwear, Tzila places a square of toilet paper over his boyhood. Benzion has borrowed a local rabbi's car and gotten into an accident that damaged the grille, and now wants Blum to lie and write a letter explaining that there are no mechanics in town available to service the car. ""They're so horrible, so pushy,"" complains Blum's wife Edith to him in the kitchen. The scene goes on for more than twenty pages and it's not the end of the Blums' suffering: later, the Netanyahu children will break the Blums' new color TV and the eldest Netanyahu child Jonathan will seduce Blum daughter Judy while future prime minister Benjamin watches.Cohen explains in an afterword that the inspiration for the novel came from Harold Bloom, a mentor and the book's dedicatee. On one of their last visits Bloom told Cohen about ""the time he was asked to coordinate the campus visit of an obscure Israeli historian named Ben-Zion Netanyahu, who showed up for a job interview and lecture with his wife and three children in tow and proceeded to make a mess.""The plot and the prose flow along nicely, but it's hard to ignore all the big words Cohen tosses around. Caudillo, glabrous, sudorous, lucubration, frum, yecca, nugatory, midden, meekened, entelechy, ponton, labent, proboscine, pelage, heliumated, sere, mittened, eisegetical, sublunary, hyemal, glorioled, pentimento, recense, capirote, hidalgo, connate, tenebrous, coruscant, carceral, serried, horripilated. Another oddity was the use of ""diningroom"" rather than dining room. You wouldn't notice this once or twice, but Cohen used it eight times."

This is a book that is hard to categorise and I laud the author for not getting caught in categories - it is fiction, but close to fact; it is funny, but also serious; it has some obnoxious people in it, who one dislikes but learns to see their point of view a little. It is well written. The topic touching on the Jewish identity, had things to think about for many immigrant communities thinking about where they belong with sometimes conflicting ties to old and new homes. For all this, it did not totally engage me, at least not after the first few chapters. I found I could take it or leave it. A good read but not good enough for the expectation. Perhaps this points to a problem with writing awards and prizes. When I choose a book because of them I expect more and grade accordingly. Possibly unfair on the author, although given the books sales such a prize generates, I doubt they are that bothered!"

Ovviamente n√© io n√© lo scrittore vogliamo entrare, proprio in questi momenti nella politica attuale israeliana e statunitense, anche se non si pu√≤ fare a meno di pensarci. Il passato, comunque e sempre, serve a comprendere il presente e in questo caso a puntualizzare i rapporti che ci sono stati e che ancora ci sono tra l‚Äôebraismo americano e quello di Israele. La vicenda si svolge nei primi anni ‚Äô50 (quindi pochi anni dopo la creazione dello stato di Israele) nello stato di New York presso il Corbin College. Il professor Ruben Blum, unico docente ebreo del suo college, √® incaricato di accogliere e seguire l‚Äôeccentrico professor Netanyahu e la sua famiglia. Gi√† questo √® il primo punto sul quale soffermarsi perch√© Ruben, come molti degli ebrei statunitensi √® laico e completamente americanizzato. E gi√† questo incarico per lui e la moglie √® discriminante ma allora certi ambienti americani erano ancora esclusivi e poco aperti al confronto con altre identit√† e culture. Il secondo aspetto √® la descrizione del personaggio di Year Netanyahu, una figura narcisista, che si appoggia alla figura del padre, allora primo ministro israeliano e figura politica carismatica ed importante, per farsi largo nella societ√† pubblica e nella politica. Yar √® uno studioso dell‚ÄôInquisizione spagnola ma soprattutto √® legato alla al sionismo revisionista, un sionismo a tutti i costi! Non mi soffermo su questo punto doloroso, dico solo che Ruben si vede costretto a riflettere profondamente sulle sue radici come non aveva mai fatto.

I‚Äôm a year late opening the 2022 Pulitzer-winner for fiction The Netanyahus: An Account of a Minor and Ultimately Even Negligible Episode in the History of a Very Famous Family, and it‚Äôs not the variety of memorable winner for me that I hoped for.It‚Äôs pedantic and tedious to where it gave me a headache trying to keep up with the cumbersome, lumbering sentences that stacked up like endless lists of obscure, erudite insights and descriptions. With that said, Cohen‚Äôs knowledge and intellect are impressive, and he possesses a skill for cleverness and humor that is easily apparent. The problem is that he buries his cleverness and humor with limitless telling and an accumulation of details before actually giving us the story in between. Then he labors out the story so slowly, again buried with a tonnage of academic and scholarly minutiae.The story, when there is one, deals with Professor Ruben Blum who is chosen to host Israeli scholar Benzion Netanyahu at Corbin College, a fictionalized university in not-quite northern New York. What constitutes the narrative could have worked better as a short story. To the contrary, it‚Äôs incredibly slogged out to the point of yawning and exhaustion. High-level scholarship on Jewry and Jewish history is loaded up throughout, and so too are the obvious laughs intended, but the story lacks.A much more rollicking and brilliantly comedic and satirical campus novel is Richard Russo‚Äôs Straight Man. As for more ingenious dry and dark humor and more piercing drama about the Jewish experience, seek out the incomparable Philip Roth‚Äôs oeuvre. In particular, I‚Äôll suggest the works of his that have made an indelible impact on me: The Ghost Writer, The Counterlife, Operation Shylock, American Pastoral, I Married a Communist, and The Human Stain."
119,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5159924-shira-reiss,Rating 1 out of 5,"This book was one of the book selections for my Hadassah Book group. It was chosen for 2 reasons: it won a Pulitzer Prize and it was described as a humorous mix of fiction and non-fiction about the Netanyahus. We deduced from this that it would be a book about the Netanyahus. I feel like the title was a ‚Äútrick‚Äù to get people to read the book because it is NOT about The Netanyahus. It‚Äôs a fictional account of them as the worst house guests ever. Maybe the author has met Israelis that he found aggressive and decided to project this fantasy on the Netanyahus. It really was very mean-spirited.  After listening to a good part of the book which is supposed to be a true story about Harold Bloom, a professor (who has passed that the author claims to have cared for), and Bloom‚Äôs experiences in the 1960s as the only Jewish professor on campus, I don‚Äôt understand why he would choose to ridicule him as he does. I can‚Äôt imagine that this professor wouldn‚Äôt be appalled at the way he is described as an insecure out-of-place, meek college professor with a teenage girl who hates her Jewish nose, a harsh, entitled, judgmental mother-in-law; all of the stereotypes of assimilated self-hating Jews. One reviewer called Cohen ‚Äúheir to the literary throne of the late Philip Roth.‚Äù This makes sense since Roth produced books with similar messages about the American Jewish experience.  The Pulitzer Prize committee called the novel ‚Äúa mordant, linguistically deft historical novel about the ambiguities of the Jewish-American experience, presenting ideas and disputes as volatile as its tightly-wound plot.‚Äù I just don‚Äôt understand why it won a Pulitzer.The author said: ‚ÄúI wanted to write something about the identity politics and the campus politics that are around us,‚Äùand make a connection to Ben Tzion representing ‚Äúthe tribalism that happens when these large ethnic or racial collectives collapse ‚Äî these empires collapse, and they collapse into tribalism.‚Äù I never enjoyed reading about Philip Roth‚Äôs struggle as a Jew in America which may be why I didn‚Äôt enjoy this book.

I immediately used an Audible credit to purchase it.Over the past few years I have read several novels by Philip Roth, Saul Bellow, and Bernard Malamud. However, as a middle aged woman born in Iowa, and raised in Colorado, I have had very little exposure to Jewish culture, history and thought. My knowledge and understanding is negligible. Going into this one, I wish that I had more background first.The Netanyahus felt completely unique and the writing is brilliant. I laughed aloud several times. I stopped my book and rewound in order to listen to the well-crafted passage a second time. I appreciated the unique storytelling style which combined real people with fictional, actual history moments of imagination, and satire with realism. However, (and this is perhaps due to the missing chunks of my knowledge) I couldn't find a deeply resonant connection with the characters.What did work extremely well for me, was the examination of what it means to be Jewish. I loved the author's deft portrayal of contrast. The fictional narrator's way of living life in midcentury America was to assimilate (to perhaps hide much of his Jewishness) and to be moldable, progressive and pliant. Cohen sets this against the real man, Benzion Netanyahu, who is the opposite, an unbending Zionist who believes that the Jew must not assimilate. He is a harsh, brash, antagonistic man who is seen as a fanatic even by Israel. This is a story that resonates with me, as the opposing views of right and left, black and white, religious and nonreligious, and conservative and liberal, tend to have these kinds of contrast and frustration.I am glad to have read it, but I think perhaps I will need to attack this one again after more exposure to Jewish literature and thought."

The language, to start with, showcases a literary genius at work. The reviewer felt that his vocabulary was shamefully inadequate all through, but frequent runs to the dictionary did not make the prose any less joyful. The descriptions, statement structures, and dialogues will keep any collector of quotable quotes busy with their highlighters and the non-collectors mesmerized.Rivaling the language is the book's wit. Superficially, the jokes are based on time-worn subterfuges involving eccentric personalities, clumsy actions, and embarrassing outcomes. However, the intelligent undercurrents move the story forward in powerful ways and create easy avenues for rather intricate and serious discussions on various political and historical matters.And the book is about the Jews in various communities, including within their own - as individuals carrying interpretations of the collective history. Like in real life, the book's Jews come in all varieties. What binds them is more than just religion (or even ""race,"" as the book expounds on) but the sufferings of their ilk for millennia. The story shows the difference between what the outsiders simply see as one whole is a set of individuals with divisions as pronounced as their common denominators. Above all, it is about the Israeli leader in his formative years and his family in a fictionalized, humourous setting. Through his parents, particularly his father, the author shines the light on the possible genesis of his current orthodox views. Although never overtly, the author finds rather innovative ways to discuss relevant episodes of the near- and far-pasts to build the case.There is a lot to enjoy and learn, even more to ponder on in this intelligent work.

Of course, afterwards the novel went on to win a little award called the Pulitzer Prize. I borrowed the book from the library the day the winner was announced. This book is smart with erudite diction, a fractured structure, and a plot that captures a snapshot in time in 1960. I thought the novel was brilliant. Most of the novel is narrated in the first person by Ruben Blum, a Jewish history professor in New York. He moved to the small town from New York City with his wife, Edith, and daughter, Judy. Ruben is the only Jewish professor at the college, and the family may be the only Jewish family in town. Ruben describes their move and their life in the small college town while preparing to interview Ben-Zion Netanyahu for a professorship. A few chapters are complete letters of recommendation for Netanyahu. In the last third of the book, we meet the titular Netanyahus. Though the plot is quite thin, I was riveted by this book. The writing is smart and engaging. I didn‚Äôt expect it to be as funny as it was containing many moments that border on slapstick and dark humor, especially towards the end. I liked how the book builds tension by not presenting the Netanyahus until almost the end. The characters, the situation, the humor all create a really creative book.

So unfolds a series of events involving Blum's in-laws, an unfortunate injury and questionable accident with his daughter, culminating in the tumultuous arrival of not just potential Professor Netanyahu, but his wife and three sons. Cohen's characters are the best part of this novel. They are well-developed, equipped with intelligent dialogue and conversation that is believably instead of overly pretentious. There is a lot of Jewish history peppered in between the family dramas, but just as I felt I was slipping away with a new account of the Jewish experience during the Spanish Inquisition, Cohen brought me back with an unbelievable comment or action from the Netanyahus or Blums. my childhood was tugged between conflicting exceptionalisms, between the American condition of being able to choose and the Jewish condition of being chosenShe had that smart cruelty to her of someone who‚Äôd gotten what she wanted.

126,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5651714-nadirah,Rating 4 out of 5,"Campy and funny, ""The Netanyahus"" is a fictional account of Ben-Zion Netanyahu's visit to a university in the US once upon a time, where it turned out the man had brought his family in tow and 'proceeded to make a mess'. As the details of the actual visit remain relatively unknown (the anecdotal story was related to Cohen by Harry Bloom, who had been the one to handle the visit), Cohen took some creative licenses to speculate on what might have happened on that day, so it's best to treat this book as 90% fiction and roll with it.The offbeat humor here lies in Cohen's writing, where the snappy dialogues and the almost slapstick comedy made me feel like I was watching one of those 1940s movies. Blume's inner dialogue tickled me to no end (the Church of Assumption was a nice touch), but there are also heavy discussions of history and theology, and the blurred lines between those two, especially once the titular character made his appearance. The themes of identity and tokenism within academia and/or the corporate world was also discussed within the narrative to great effect, considering this barrier still exists for POCs and women.While I enjoyed this, it's probably not for those who are easily offended by fictional portrayals of real-life people because Cohen's version of Netanyahu leaves readers no doubt as to which side of the fence he stood at."
127,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13323030-jaclyn,Rating 4 out of 5,"Last week Joshua Cohen went and won the @pulitzerprizes for fiction with a book I had not heard of. The last book of his I read was Book of Numbers. Anyway all that is to say this was surprising. The Pulitzer is probably my favourite prize. The Netanyahus tells the comic account of Harold Bloom, reborn here as Ruben Blum, hosting Benzion Netanyahu (father of Benjamin) as he interviews for a university academic position. Cohen had heard about this from Bloom himself and transformed it into inventive and bold fiction. So much about this book should not work and yet against all odds it does. There is so much here about Jewish identity and politics that I‚Äôm sure I missed some of it but feel like I still learnt a lot. Cohen is an unmatched prose stylist and I delighted in his stylistic acrobatics. This is not the kind of book you love, it‚Äôs the kind of book you admire and appreciate. Cohen‚Äôs intelligence is impressive and his ironic and droll reimagining of this moment in time is something to behold. "
128,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69489764-b-ra,Rating 3 out of 5,"This novel is undoubtedly one of a kind, in its spellbinding experimentation with both genre and narrative, and perhaps that‚Äôs what makes it so popular. I quite enjoyed the contextualization of post-war Jewish identities into a campus environment. I felt that the relationship between Netanyahu and Blum fell a bit short and would have wished for the dialogues between them to be in the center, as the reader‚Äôs understanding of their conflicting ideologies is largely informed by prior, disconnected ramblings or letters, barely interactive. That Cohen is an eloquent writer is unquestionable and yet the different types of texts employed, from lectures on the Inquisition to letters written to and conversations with other characters and finally monologues ‚Äì while interesting in their own way ‚Äì missed a linguistic, more precisely a stylistic uniqueness that makes them stick out from one another."
129,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10168276-george,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 stars. A very interesting, humorous, inventive, memorable novel about the visit of Ben Zion Netanyahus, a prospective Israeli scholar specializing in the Spanish Inquisition from the Jewish perspective. It is the winter of 1959-1960 at Corbin College, New York. The story is told by Ruben Blum, a Jewish historian employed by Corbin College, who is reviewing the application of Ben Zion Netanyahus. Ben Zion arrives for an interview and to give a lecture. Unexpectedly he brings his family, which leads to some surprising events. Ruben and his wife, Edith, are taken out of their comfort zones.This book was first published in 2021 and won the 2022 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Highly recommended. A novel worth rereading."

However, I found myself enjoying every page I read of Cohen's fiction meets lecture meets biography. This texts is brilliantly witty every step of the way, weaving the real-life thesis and academia of Ben-Zion Netanyahu, with a humorous and insightful depiction of what it is to be Jewish, particularly in America. . The way Cohen shows the differentiation and indeed tension that arises with the intersection of class, culture, language, etc and the Jewish diaspora was something that I, as an outsider, found to be particularly interesting. "
131,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76558755-v,Rating 3 out of 5,"Charming dialogue, snowy upstate atmosphere, and skillfully rendered diatribes lead this short novel to the finish line and support its liberal, gently ironic message about identity. Otherwise -- the underdone fiction/reality diddling, lazy humor, and the really dry dull dullness of it all -- it's quite small potatoes and reminds me of a lesser later Roth."

137,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4999879-lindaj,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book is a nominee for the 2021 National Book Critics Circle Award. While this is not one of the awards that I regularly read the nominees for, when I realized it was the only one on the list I had not read, I decided I needed to be a completist. I enjoyed it as I did most of the books on the list. It is a strange but clever novel that apparently has a true story as its core, one that the author was told by critic Harold Bloom. Ruben Blum is the only Jewish professor (teaching the history of taxation) at a small liberal arts college in upstate New York (upstate NY, like the Pennsylvania T, is right of center country). Blum and his wife are not religious and would just like to blend in. Their daughter Judy is at the top academically in her class and very desirous of getting her nose fixed. The two sets of grandparents are almost complete opposites, with Blum's parents being hard working, lower middle-class, religious Jews and his wife's parents being rich, not-so-religious Jews (think of Mrs. Maisel's parents from the TV comedy Mrs. Maisel). Blum is asked to be part of the history department's hiring committee that has been told it will lose a chunk of its budget if it does not hire a professor to share with the religion department. A candidate has been recommended - Benzion Netanyahu (a real life figure - zionist and father of recent Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu). The Department head asks Blum to check Netanyahu out. Blum figures he was added to the committee only because he is Jewish. Blum is to host Netanyahu when he comes for his campus visit, at which he will not only meet the hiring committee but also give a public lecture and teach a Bible class at the campus chapel. Unexpected by everyone at the college, Netanyahu shows up at Blum's house with his wife and their three children, all of whom behave badly.The author's afterward describes how he got to know Harold Bloom and hear the Netanyahu story."

Regardless of the length, the characters were well-crafted and amusing. Maybe because the book was mainly about the characters or some history rather than events. And I'm saying this lovingly. Maybe not so lovingly about the historic parts. These were hard to relate to for me, a non-scholar non-jew. Even though they were expository, it was just hard to follow.But the rest? It was clever and funny. The limited events that happened in this book, the dialogue, the inner thoughts, and the wanderings of the main character, Professor Blum.And the ending? It just felt brilliant. It's remarkable how one sentence in a dialogue felt this genuine to me. Needless to say, it was something funny and the book made a great job setting up this witty carefully-constructed atmosphere for the ending to hit just right.Ah, and the ending credits. I've never read any afterwords more interesting and intriguing to follow.

This is really funny at times, I adored the family dynamics, the awkward relationships between the families and the outrageous behaviour of so many of them. This book takes you all over the place, it takes you down rabbit holes of history and then into the popular culture of the USA in the 1970s. The visit of the Netanyahus into the home of our protagonist and his family is incredibly awkward reading, their awful children and their manipulation of their hosts is simultaneously funny and horrifying. Unusual and interesting and offering the occasional groan of comedic horror. Happy times. "

155,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43332042-lindsay-saligman,Rating 5 out of 5,"I loved this book for the way it made me, as a Jew, think deeply on issues of identity. To me, this book was all about what it means to be a American Jew in a post 1948 world. It‚Äôs first half, which details the history of the fictional Blum and his family, seemed to me to encapsulate a lot of aspects of the Jewish American experience: It showed how many communities of diverse experience from around the world bubbled and boiled in the American melting pot to create a somehow ancient somehow brand-new diaspora identity the members of which, while definitely distinct from Christian America, are not fully sure of who they are or to what extent they should assimilate.The book also brilliantly lays out how the Diaspora Jews (though this statement applies to the diaspora at large, I should acknowledge that this book focuses mainly on the US Jewish experience) is in a very complicated relationship with the other half of the Jewish community: the Israeli Jews. This brings me to the second half of the book, when the Netanyahus meet the Blums. Though this part of the book is nothing short of absurd when taken at face value, when I started thinking of it as a metaphor for the clashes and tensions between Diaspora and Israeli Jews I found it highly relatable and at many points illuminating. It made me think about the ways the two communities shape each other, and the overall affect these interactions have had on the Jewish identity as a whole. If you want to know what specific truths the book ‚Äòrevealed‚Äô to me, I‚Äôm happy to discuss privately, but it seems too personal for a book review. Critics of the book will say it is unnecessarily pretentious and inaccessible, and I agree, but it still gets five stars for making me think so much. As for those who are offended by the negative and fictionalized portrayal of the ‚Äúvery famous family‚Äù I kind of think it‚Äôs within the fair bounds of satire and criticism which should be welcome in a democratic society. Is it a bit sketchy to claim the portrayal of the Netanyahu‚Äôs is the real them in the same breath as saying you needed to invent certain details? Perhaps. But it would also appear Cohen went to great lengths to research the family and even contact them for their perspective, to no avail. This being the case, even the aforementioned sketchiness is understandable in my view (Cohen did what he could). "

Non tanto perch√® Cohen affronti la questione israelo-palestinese (non lo fa affatto), quanto per la prospettiva cos√¨ peculiare e unica sulla famiglia Netanyahu: una prospettiva cos√¨ inaspettata, cos√¨ casual, cos√¨ nonchalant, che alzare lo sguardo dalle pagine per ritornare poi a leggere lo stesso cognome sulle testate dei giornali e in televisione e sui social, e in un contesto cos√¨ drammaticamente diverso, d√† davvero i brividi. Ma questo non √® un romanzo storico. Non √® neanche un saggio. √à una commedia, √® una storia, √® un aneddoto. Un ""episodio"", come preannuncia anche il titolo, che sembra un'enorme barzelletta dalla punchline grottesca e volgare, ma che comunque si trascina dietro un bagaglio di riflessioni impossibili da evitare. Joshua Cohen √® uno scrittore brillante, soprattutto un narratore coinvolgente e dal senso dell'umorismo vibrante (a mio parere ben pi√π sagace di Allen, cui l'ho visto spesso paragonato). Ho apprezzato molto la sua prosa e in particolare i suoi dialoghi. Leggere ""I Netanyahu"" significa accettare di fare una capriola dentro la storia rocambolesca di un disgraziato docente di storia che prova, disperato, a gestire un ospite ingestibile. Ma significa anche, e sopratutto, trovarsi immersi fino ai gomiti in una questione che forse proprio adesso emerge pi√π prepotente del solito per noi ""occidentali"": quella dell'identit√† del popolo ebraico, della sua storia, del sentimento di appartenenza, dell'ebraismo che da culto si fa razza ed etnia, degli ebrei americani, degli ebrei occidentali, del sionismo e degli ebrei che, anni dopo l'episodio da cui trae ispirazione questo libro, supporteranno Bibi Netanyahu, fino agli eventi che negli ultimi giorni e mesi hanno visto l'inasprirsi del conflitto in Palestina e il massacro del popolo palestinese."

The fact Joshua Cohen can just make up whatever he wants and leave it to us to decide whether it is a truth or a lie is just a tad too 1933 nazi germany for my taste (or maybe too ""two lies and a truth"" id you're not as dramatic as me) - and the fact thia book is being supported wildly and even won awards is very very worrying.I agree that every non-fiction book has fiction in it, but I feel here it crossed the line into propagenda and politics that it shouldn't have. I don't support RPF and this was a blantant RPF by someone who met the family once and honestly if someone I met once and barely spoke to would write this kind of book abou tme I'd probably feel him to be very creepy to say the least."

Unrelentingly agonising and crude, it felt like an attack on the family that went far beyond a credible critique - rather the fulfilment of the author‚Äôs personal agenda. If Cohen‚Äôs objective was to make his reader hate the Netanyahus, then of course he succeeded.

177,no user info,Rating 2 out of 5,"Listened to audiobookThis is a difficult book for me to rate. I found some parts funny, others sad, and a good portion of it confusing or just over my head. I think there is something to be said for my gross lack of knowledge or understanding of Jewish culture and history, which definitely left me feeling ill-equipped to fully grasp references or inferences that those more steeped in this tradition would know and appreciate. The most enjoyable chapters were spent with the Blum family. They contain equal parts absurd comedy and relatable family conflict. The lectures and letters and history portions of the book were the most difficult for me, and my brain tended to wander during parts of them. Not because of any disinterest, but rather due to my ignorance in the subject.A question that Cohen seems to be hinting at through the novel is ""What does it mean to be Jewish in America?"" Or even more broadly it may be ""What does it mean to be American?"". This contemplation is played out in the Blum's household through the family dynamics, as well as in the scholarly halls of the college campus in which the main character, Ruben Blum, is a professor. Both in his career and in his familial role, Ruben tends to go along to get along. He takes no particular stance on his Jewish heritage, neither culturally nor religiously, and is often being put in the center of conflicts or situations that show the reader his lack of conviction. Despite this, he begins to acknowledge to himself that perhaps his constant placating and lack of established identity is harmful -not only to himself, but to his family. The most powerful example is in the character of his daughter, Judy. She is fully immersed in American culture, and seems to have no consideration for her Jewish heritage. In fact, she is so determined to fit into her American world, that she longs (and goes to great lengths) to completely change a physical characteristic that signifies her lineage. This comes to head in a funny yet heartbreaking scene which prompts more inward contemplation from Ruben to wrestle with the past, present, and future, and what that looks like for a Jew in America.The Netanyahus come barging in late in the book, and they certainly make an impression. Honestly, I am a little confused by what exactly they represent, since I know little of Jewish politics and not much about Netanyahu himself. They were definitively depicted as a crude, uncouth and raucous family. Their antics were mutually funny and anxiety-inducing. When Blum listens to Netanyahu (here it is the father of future Israeli PM Benjamin) give his lectures on the history of Iberian Jews and his views of Jews in America, it enhances Ruben's feeling of emptiness and disconnect to any particular identity. The Netanyahus are quite a disruption to the Blum's seemingly complacent, normal American life, and thier visit exposes the bits of disfunction that were hidden underneath.The ending of the book felt abrupt, and I wish there was a little more to indicate what changed, or didn't change, for the Blum family after the Netanyahu visit."
178,no user info,No Rating,"I did not understand my reaction to this book - I loved it at first and/but grew to almost hate it. I was really intrigued by the time and setting at the start of the book, but I guess steadily lost interest as the Netanyahus themselves entered the story and things went off the rails (and got more slapstick - the door/nose job might have been a low point of the book for me, maybe matched only by Judy's last interaction with the eldest Netanyahu son). There's a lot of fun and humor early on with etymology and language. Some of my issue as well was probably the fact vs fiction elements, especially around the elder Netanyahu's hypothesis about the Spanish Inquisition. I guess it's my own ignorance but I didn't know how seriously to take the idea - I got the sense the author was mocking it?And then everything about Harold Bloom in the afterword rubbed me the wrong way. I guess it made me wonder how much I should revisit the story and again, the fact/fiction tension throughout. I felt the same way about Second Place and its afterword. It probably also didn't help my experience that I was reading Attention: Dispatches from a Land of Distraction, so maybe I was just getting tired of Cohen.But I would be happy to read MUCH more of Taffy Brodesser-Akner's thoughts on the book!!! https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/18/bo..."

After Ulysses, I‚Äôve been craving this particular dark humour, absurd characters and highly incomprehensible, theological, philosophical pondering; The Netanyahus gave me just that. Plot: First of all, Benjamin Netayahus is the longest serving Prime Minister of Israel, a highly controversial leadership figure. And this book is‚Ä¶ not about him, but about his father ‚Äî wait, but it‚Äôs not really about his father either. It‚Äôs about Ruben Blum, a Jewish historian who is on the hiring committee for Benjamin Netayahus‚Äô father‚Äôs as a professor in a small-town university. The story mixes fiction with non-fiction, creating a hazy atmosphere that makes you question what you‚Äôve just read, and brings John Lennon‚Äôs Strawberry Fields to mind, where nothing is real. Cohen basically throws in a cup of theology and a handful of philosophy, then sprinkles of politics and race along with a lashing of humour into this brilliant novel. Prose: Cohen is a highly intelligent author, too intelligent for me sometimes. Many parts of this novel are hard to grasp with completely alien knowledge to me. To top it off, I have no idea what‚Äôs true and what‚Äôs not since he clearly states that this is a fictional story. Yet Cohen‚Äôs humour shines through it all, I enjoy reading this very much solely because of how funny and witty the writing is.The novel starts with: ‚ÄúMy name is Ruben Blum and I‚Äôm an, yes, an historian. Soon enough, though, I guess I‚Äôll be historical. By which I mean I‚Äôll die and become history myself, in a rare type of transformation traditionally reserved for the purer scholars‚ÄùThe novel ends with: ‚ÄúAdmit it, even literacy is dying - and when the last old Jew of you is finally as dead as God this proud nonbinary dyke YES DYKE is going to dance naked as hell on his grave.‚Äù A whole 5 stars!

I regret that my thoughts on this are so superficial: a book about the place of Jewish people in a post-war America, and I immediately thought of Herzog and Humboldt and Ravelstein. I mentioned the book to my father, and he said he'd give it a wide berth as he has no interest in books about politicians. I reassured him that Benjamin Netanyahu (the most famous of the family) played a very small role in the book. Rather, the novel stands along side other great campus novels like Lucky Jim, Straight Man, Pnin and Special Topics in Calamity Physics. (Admittedly this is a personal collection of favorites, far from definitive). Cohen gives us great set pieces skewering the campus job interview, the guest lecture, and the awkwardness of hosting an obnoxious guest.The Afterword, in which Cohen recounts a brief history of the Netanyahu family after the events and how he came to write the book, gave to me an envious glimpse into what must have been a remarkable life. Name dropping galore. I sunk to invidious muttering, imagining working and socializing among those luminaries of 20th century literature."

183,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22735121-matt-bender,Rating 5 out of 5,"Cohen‚Äôs book is a hysterical, short novel with an A-side about the Netanyahu (family‚Äôs) job talk for a tenure track professor post. During the interview, Netanyahu is hosted by Harold Bloom, his wife, and Judy Blume. Cohen‚Äôs post script (which is also 5 star material) claims it is a tale largely based in truth. The inquisition of Netanyahu, who is portrayed as a narcissist propagandist, was probably the funniest description of ‚ÄúThe Academy‚Äù that I‚Äôve ever read. Netanyahu bombs the interview and the job talk through the course of several extraordinarily funny scenes. Bloom‚Äôs anxiety while preparing for the callback and efforts to navigate his faculty politics are equally clever. The B-side is an even funnier description of the Netanyahu family (yeah that one, Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs fam), which Cohen portrays as a set of striving, ridiculously blame shifting, and antagonistic parents with feral children. Cohen claims this hit piece is largely truthful (although based on the hearsay of Harold Bloom). The Blooms‚Äô family dynamic (much more fictionalized per Cohen) is not as ridiculous, but it‚Äôs probably even funnier, especially the parts involving the grandparents and Judith. This book is political too, which I won‚Äôt dive into other than to say the juxtaposition of faculty politics was fascinating plotting. Recommended for professors of all sorts and anyone who enjoys subversive comedy (these two categories should not be conflated)."

Durante a leitura, o autor mostra as peculiaridades da integra√ß√£o da fam√≠lia Netanyahu nos EUA onde n√£o renunciaram com tanta facilidade √†s suas origens judaicas, n√£o permitindo que a vida americana os influenciasse. Um livro com uma mistura de fic√ß√£o e n√£o fic√ß√£o com uma pitada de s√°tira, que levanta quest√µes de integra√ß√£o, identidade e politica pelos olhos da popula√ß√£o judaico-americana. Este romance mostra tamb√©m o inicio da ascens√£o de uma familia importante que mais tarde iriam ser respons√°veis pelas pol√≠ticas de Israel at√© aos dias atuais. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
185,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/129485227-veda-sunkara,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5!! this book was not at all what I expected. The story follows a Jewish history professor at Corbin College, Ruben Blum, who at the time (1960s?) is the only Jewish faculty at the school and is tasked with vetting a new faculty member who turns out to be Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äòs father, Ben Zion. Honestly this read like a sit com, it covered a very short time period and had such profound character development - the authors pokes fun at the absurdity of the situation and Zionism in really clever and funny ways. So many scenes felt like they were transcribed from a slapstick comedy/90‚Äôs sitcom, but also had many levels of humor. It‚Äôs based (loosely) on a real interaction along these lines, with character traits from real sources that then were used to craft this cast of characters. I think this is worth a reread for me - I only docked it .5 because I think at a few times I felt lost and had to reread/some of the humor I‚Äôm sure went over my head."
186,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3511708-mark,Rating 2 out of 5,"Read for the 2022 PopSugar reading challenge. I'm calling this ""A book that features two languages,"" as Hebrew is significant to its pages, though it may not be, strictly speaking, featured. This was the winner of the 2022 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.This is one of those books where both the title and the description of the book are not really telling you the truth about what the book is. Or at least, if you ask me, a book with the name The Netanyahus had really ought not have more than half of the book gone before anyone with this name appears on the page. They are important, in the sense that their eventual arrival does drive some of what passes for the action here, but this only goes so far. It's not about them! It's mostly about an elderly narrator looking back on a period of professional tumult in the middle of his career.When I was younger, I went to school with a lot of Jewish kids. On more than one occasion, one of the Jewish kids assumed I was also Jewish. A kid who was in band with me said my habit of picking up pennies if I saw them on the ground made me an honorary Jew. A friend made this proclamation after she witnessed me order a pastrami on rye. A third declared a demonstration of my morbid humor to be very Jewish. Adults would do this too. One time I went to get my hair cut like a week before Rosh Hashanah and the stylist wished me happy holidays. A friend's mother, whose house I had been going to for a couple of years at the point she said this, once wished me Happy Hanukkah in December. I absorbed their jokes about Jewish parents, about hypochondriac relatives, and all kinds of other things.None of which made me Jewish-adjacent enough to get just about any of the jokes in this book. Again, it bills itself as a comedy, except it's not! Unless it's funny to have the narrator getting a lecture from his perpetually disappointed mother-in-law while the text periodically inserts descriptions of the father-in-law in the bathroom unleashing a monster, toilet-clogging shit, which the FIL attempts to unclog with a plunger. Or funny for one set of your Jewish grandparents to hate the other because of grudges between cultures that dated back to the old world.Maybe I'm just neither Jewish nor literary enough to get it. In a post-text comment by the author, he describes having gotten to correspond with the literary critic, writer, and professor Harold Bloom towards the end of his life, during which correspondence Cohen eventually heard the anecdote that forms the back third or so of this book: Ben-Zion Netanyahu (father of Benjamin) showing up for an interview at Cornell with his entire family in tow unannounced, being absolutely rude to everyone, bombing the interview, bombing the guest lecture, bickering with his wife. The basic problem is this whole thing is not a book! It's a story to tell at a party - for Bloom himself perhaps when he was alive, or even just Cohen to swear that he heard it straight from Bloom's lips. The time a ten-year-old Benjamin Netanyahu was swept along with his idiot father, and the entire weird-ass family never once remarked on the fact that the seven-year-old kid showed up in diapers. If all you've got for symbolism is the sledgehammer of a family unexpectedly invading a house, being asked to take their shoes off, blowing into the house without doing it, then complaining the whole time after they comply with this modest request, well, you know.Cohen, through his narrator, the fictional (but not that fictional) Ruben Blum, lands some sick burns on the Netanyahu clan, about Ben-Zion's perpetual grievances about his own shortcomings, about the arrogance of the change of the family name from a banal reference to being from a mill town to ""God's give,"" his unearned sense of entitlement, his apparently weird interpretation of the Spanish Inquisition that seemed to have no support in scholarship but lined up neatly with a Netanyahu-preferred way of viewing the state of Israel in its infancy in the 20th century. If this is the patriarch, could any son of his possibly have much good to offer in the world of geopolitics? The implied answer, of course, is no. And we know that Benjamin did not. Yet even if one is inclined as a matter of one's own politics to accept that every one of these burns is the truth, that does not make this any more of an interesting book to read. The few interesting bits, e.g. Blum's observation about ""the church of the assumption,"" the contrast between the secular in-laws and the religious parents, petty departmental politics grudges, and so on, are scattered and don't come together into an interesting whole.This is one of those Pulitzer winners where I'm just floored by what merit they found in this. I will make the assumption, with a dose of cynicism, that a certain type of literary person who would be chosen to nominate/award Pulitzers was won over by the book-long reference to Bloom. I am not that type of person. I did not know Harold Bloom existed before reading the ""Credits and Extra Credits"" following the close of the novel. The process can award amazing books sometimes - last year's winner The Night Watchman was brilliant. The two recent wins for Colson Whitehead were great books. Even ones I was less overwhelmed by at least had something that felt interesting at the heart of them. So it's not like it's always bad. Or even often bad! But then sometimes there's... this."
187,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"You can‚Äôt make this stuff up!!!A brilliant comedic account (on the verge of cringe) of a hellish encounter between a Jewish American professor with an eccentric Israeli professor (Bibi Netanyahu‚Äôs father) who is on a mission to land a faculty position in an obscure upstate NY college. The chain of events that follows is so outrageous and is told with such mastery by Cohen that there is no doubt in my mind it actually happened. For those intimately familiar with the nuanced intricacies of Jewish and Israeli culture, as well as the last 50 years of Netanyahus active (and often destructive) involvement in Israeli government, military and social dynamics - this story definitely hits home. Not sure how it reads for anyone else, because you really need a lot of inside information to fully appreciate the humor and the horror of this story.My favorite part btw, was not related to Netanyahu‚Äôs visit but the chapter that described Blum‚Äôs in-laws visit to campus.

Fun idea for a story, as Joshua Cohen explains in his afterward. The ideas that Ben-Zion N expresses are explained with erudition and energy, no little feat. Yet I wanted to get beyond Rube Blum's narrative voice; why was Edith so snippy? What did students think of the test-lecture? How old was Yoni exactly when caught in delicto flagrante? And, for the author: check your 1960 time-set. Pampers did appear a year later, but I doubt that an Israeli wife let alone the Blums would have heard of or used them. Percodan did not come along until 1965. While Blum narrates his past, a period of grade school he recalls two teachers would put their encounters with him around the start of the Depression, when nobody went by ""Ms. Ianone"" or ""Ms. Murphy."" Can't figure out the anachronism."

235,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3106785-beth-bonini,Rating 4 out of 5,"At times immensely readable, at times a proper challenge - it can read more like an academic paper than a work of fiction - it‚Äôs difficult for me to form a coherent response to this book. I felt little emotional connection to it, and didn‚Äôt have much appetite for it, yet it certainly earned my regard and admiration. I read it with my Pulitzer Prize reading group, and probably wouldn‚Äôt have persisted with what felt like a task if that hadn‚Äôt been the case. It‚Äôs undeniably clever, but I constantly felt like I was missing the point or not quite in on the joke. Let me give you a bit of the flavour of the writing, and this is an excerpt that I did understand:
Just about a decade prior to the autumn I am recalling, the State of Israel was founded. In that minuscule country halfway across the globe, displaced and refugee Jews were busy reinventing themselves into a single people, united by the hatred and subjugations of contrary regimes, in a mass-process of solidarity aroused by gross antagonism. Simultaneously, a kindred mass-process was occurring here in America, where Jews were busy being deinvented, or uninvented, or assimilated, by democracy and market-forces, intermarriage and miscegenation. Regardless of where they were and the specific nature and direction of the proces, however, it remains an incontrovertible fact that nearly all of the world‚Äôs Jews were involved at midcentury in becoming something else; and that at this point of transformation, the old internal differences between them - of former citizenship and class, to say nothing of language and degree of religious observance - became for a brief moment more palpable than ever, giving one last death-rattle gasp.
The narrator of the story is Ruben Blum, the first Jewish professor on the faculty of Corbindale College - a ‚Äòsub-Ivy‚Äô college in New York state. A former Bronx Jew, of Russian/Ukranian immigrant parents, Blum‚Äôs speciality is the history of American economics. His family is rounded out by wife Edith and teenage daughter Judy. During the school year of 1959/60, Blum is just getting a firmer toehold into the community; if asked, he claims that he would say that domestic life is ‚Äòwonderful‚Äô, although he admits to himself (and confesses to the reader) that his wife is ‚Äòbored‚Äô and his daughter is ‚Äòangry‚Äô. If Blum and his family represent the mid-century Jewish American experience - a state of semi-assimilation - then the Netanyahu family represent something far more intractable. The first half of the book focuses on Ruben Blum, whilst the second half is given over to the visit of the Netanyahu family of the book‚Äôs title. (In the book‚Äôs Afterword - which Cohen titles ‚ÄòCredits & Extra Credit‚Äô - it‚Äôs revealed that the Netanyahu visit is actually based on a real visit to an American university, as recounted to the author by the famous academic Harold Bloom. ) I won‚Äôt entirely spoil the narrative surprise, but let‚Äôs just say that the visit is intense, comic, absurd and grotesque. It has been proposed that Corbindale might hire Dr Netanyahu - and presumably because of their shared Jewishness, Blum is given the responsibility of vetting Netanyahu‚Äôs references and hosting him during his visit. Unexpectedly, he brings the family - wife Tzila and their three sons - with him. I wasn‚Äôt sure, until the novel‚Äôs afterword, what was fact and was fiction. On reflection, it‚Äôs clear that the novel is attempting to elucidate how and why the United States became critical in the formation of the state of Israel. (At least that is one idea in the book, and there are plenty of others - most of them related to the Jewish experience, although Cohen is certainly very funny and knowledgeable about American academia.) The future Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu- the middle son of the Dr Netanyahu featured in this book - is characterised in this way by Cohen:
His reign, marked by the building of walls, the construction of settlements, and the normalisation of occupation and state violence against the Palestinians, represented the ultimate triumph of the formerly disgraced Revisionist vision promulgated by his father.
Reading this book was, in a way, a history lesson for me; but if anything, Cohen‚Äôs book is also (always?) a reminder that ‚Äòhistory‚Äô is just a construct shaped by the storyteller."

Not to mention, he is somehow able to make the history of the Spanish Inquisition - as it pertains to Jewish racialization - fascinating. Informative lectures on such topics are disguised with masterful fiction through the framework of really great characters and a weird premise. Not a dull moment in this book, definitely recommend. "
239,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/412881-judy,Rating 1 out of 5,"I wanted to like this book and enjoyed the first quarter or so, narrated by Ruben (Rube) Blum, where he relates the changes he has seen over a long career in academia, particularly the changes in students who have become intolerably sensitive and require coddling. But this is all just a slow build-up to the purpose of the story--taking a sledgehammer to the reputation of the real Netanyahu family. To achieve this, Blum recalls the train-wreck visit of Ben Zion Netanyahu, desperate to win a teaching position at Corbin College, where Blum, the only current Jewish faculty member, has been corralled into researching Netanyahu's academic background and chaperoning him through his visit. Blum resents this task, knowing he is only being asked because he is Jewish, as he and the visiting professor have nothing in common academically. Blum himself is totally apathetic Jewishly.In an end note, the author concedes that the book's premise was based on an anecdote told to him by the late Harold Bloom, about the historian Ben Zion Netanyahu, who indeed tried out for such a position at a college where Harold Bloom had taught, and apparently, it was a fiasco. This was thin gruel out of which to write a quasi-novel, based on real people and the memories of one now deceased witness. While Cohen can be very, very funny, when the point of a book is a mean-spirited attack on an entire family the humor begins to fail. In that same end note, Cohen also slams Bibi Netanyahu, the middle son of Ben Zion and former Israeli prime minister, even implicating him in the murder of Itzhak Rabin at that hands of extremist Yigal Amir. Cohen claims that Bibi didn't condemn extremists who attended his own political rallies with Rabin in effigy, insinuating that this may have led to Rabin's murder. I do not know whether this is true or not, but it is despicable for Cohen to identify Amir as ""Orthodox"" and driven by supposedly religious impulses without also noting that his evil act was condemed as evil such by Jews worldwide, including by the Orthodox community. He also slams many of Netanyahu's acts as PM that helped reduce the rate of terrorism in Israel, failing to note such terrorism even existed.And the novel itself is a failure on many levels. Themes that promise some exploration are dropped instantly. For example, the thoroughly secular Blum is drawn back into his painful memories of a religious upbringing by having to wade through Netanyahu's writings on the history of Jews in the Middle Ages. Will this lead to a new understanding of Blum's Jewish identity? No. It's a premise that is drop-shipped into the story but then is dropped, period. The Netanyahus themselves are so thoroughly obnoxious (Ben Zion, his wife, and their 3 sons) that any potential renewed interest Blum might have had in Jewish history or peoplehood would have been quashed.Additionally, Cohen inserts lengthy scenes, one with his parents (immigrant Jews who are not formally eduated) and one with his in-laws (secular, wealthy, and snobbish), seemingly to showcase various flavors of unappealing Jews. The parents are not part of the storyline on any ongoing basis. Blum's daughter, Judy, is a cynical high-school senior who is unhappy about her nose--another way in which Jewishness is negative in this story. But, so what? None of these characters or the scenes they are in add up to anything other than more evidence that so many manifestations of Jewishness, whether the smug, secular mother-in-law; the street savvy but crude father; the disaffected teenaged daughter, or the horrible Netanyahus themselves, are huge turn-offs.Cohen loves pretentious words, too, such as chthonic, verdigrised, coruscant, sudorous, sebacious, etc, but they do nothing to lift this disjointed story into something coherent. All it adds up to is an excuse for Cohen to exercise his anti-religious and anti-Israel bias. Talk about a turnoff."

241,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5968522-karen,Rating 2 out of 5,"I am absolutely in shock that this troubling book won a Pulitzer Prize. Maybe there are too many professors on the committee who were happy that this book, as well as Less, spoke to some of their personal teaching experiences. Perhaps they were impressed with the overwrought writing style that constantly used vocabulary almost completely forgotten by humanity. Perhaps they felt that honoring a Jewish author for writing a book that did not show one positive aspect of Jews, Judaism, Israel or the Netanyahus, was a socially acceptable way of criticizing Jews and Israel in general. No matter the reason, the result is deeply disturbing.Ruben Bloom, based on a real person, is the only Jewish professor at a college in upstate New York around 1960. His discussion about some of the issues created by that situation, were to me, the highlight of the book. Sadly, the highlights ended there.Ruben's character, as well as all of the characters, were pure stereotypes, seen often before. Ruben even describes himself with some of the same adjectives often used by Woody Allen, without Allen's clever humor. His daughter Judy, is another painful stereotype- a smart girl obsessed with getting her nose fixed. His in-laws are parodies. The only memorable family member is his father, who is given a good speech about the meaning of fairness in the world. Other than that, the parents are stereotypes as well.The most disturbing part of this book however, is its skewering of a real family. Cohen takes an anecdote about the Netanyahu family and uses it to thoroughly bash every aspect of every member of that family- even the youngest child. I have never seen anything like this deliberate hatchet job that Cohen has delivered in the guise of a novel. Many of the people that Cohen attacks are still alive, which makes it even more disturbing. In his afterward, Cohen confesses that the person Judy is based on asked to be made unrecognizable. He then has the nerve to skewer the real person, citing a letter that she wrote and making her seem deranged. He then attacks Benjamin Netanyahu's career and criticizes his political decisions. The Netanyahus isn't a novel. It is an attack piece. At some point, my main focus was on the viability of several libel suits."
242,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28476785-desirae,Rating 3 out of 5,"Joshua Cohen has written a snarky and humorous book of speculative fiction about Benzion Netanyahu‚Äôs job interview at the fictional Corbin College in western New York during the winter of 1959-60. One of the buildings at the college is called Fredonia Hall. True there a town in New York called Fredonia, but I believe the real reference to Fredonia, the mythical country in the 1933 Marx Brothers movie ‚ÄúDuck Soup.‚Äù The book is patterned after his real-life visit to Cornell where he was hosted by Harold Bloom. Netanyahu brings his whole family with him including is wife and three kids, one of whom is his son Binyamin.Much of the book has to do with his host, economic historian Ruben Blum, his family, and his identity as the only Jewish faculty member. Because he is Jewish, he is chosen to host Netanyahu who is an expert on inquisition Spain, a subject Blum knows little. Blum comes from the family of an East European garment cutter, while his wife Edith comes from a German-Jewish family of a small factory owner. The conflicts are obvious and their teen aged daughter pines for a nose job. Here we have all kinds of identity issues rapped up into one family.The Netanyahus overwhelm the Blums wreaking havoc with their home and breaking their color TV, an anachronism here because in 1960 there were very few assistant professors who owned a color TV. Color television did not become a mass consumer product until 1964. In another anachronism he has Blum‚Äôs former employer CUNY, which was not formed until 1961. Further, Ruben condescends to call the Netanyahu family the ‚ÄúYahus.‚ÄùThe book is serious when it discusses Netanyahu‚Äôs thesis that antisemitism in inquisition Spain was racialized. It did not matter whether or not a Jew converted to Catholicism, it was their blood that kept them from being true Christians. Hitler would adopt a similar view 450 years later and to me that was reinforced when I visited an exhibition on converso Spain at the New Mexico Museum. Thus, if Judaism was racialized the only solution for Jews was to have a state of their own.I sense that Cohen really does not understand the Revisionist Zionist philosophy of Benzion Netanyahu. I did learn that Netanyahu was Jabotinsky‚Äôs, the founder of Revisionist Zionism, man in the United States until he died in 1940. Several years ago, I reviewed Hillel Halkin‚Äôs biography of Jabotinsky. There I learned that Jabotinsky and Netanyahu by implication understood that 1) there would be an inherent conflict between Jews and Arabs in Palestine, 2) Nazism was going to destroy European Jewry and 3) the Labor-Zionist socialist model was not going to work in Israel. Simply put Jabotinsky and Netanyahu were clear-eyed realists. I wish Cohen grasped that fact.Nevertheless, when you get beyond the issues I have raised, I believe the reader will learn much from the issues concerning the role of Jews in America, especially in a very non-Jewish community and will enjoy the comedic touches throughout the book."

The book somehow combines slapstick comedy, history, politics, academia, and religion to analyze the Jewish Question following the Holocaust and the establishment of the state of Israel. What is our place in the world following these major events? Is the future of Judaism assimilation as an American Jew living in a non-Jewish world? Or is the future Jewish nationalism that seeks to take control of our own history by any means necessary? This tension between American and Israeli Jews continues today- between Zionism and the diaspora. Between participating in the nationalist political project of Israel or forging along with creating our own Jewish identity elsewhere. The main character is Ruben Blum, a history professor at an Ithaca like college town in random upstate New York. The history department is interviewing Ben Zion Netanyahu, father of Bibi, for a position at the college, and thru a seemingly meaningless encounter between Blum's Jewish American family and Netanyahu's Israeli family, we are given something of an allegory for the tension that exists between the Israeli and American Jewish communities: who were we in the past and who are we going to be in the future?For such intense subject matter, the book reads extremely light and humorous. Sprinkled throughout the slapstick is an extremely nuanced look at historiography and the role of history shaping Jewish identity. Netanyahu is a revisionist historian who offers an alternate interpretation of the Spanish Inquisition, in that it was the first time Jews were perceived as a race and set in motion the violent European anti-Semitism that followed in the later centuries. This idea of historical revisionism is a major theme of the book- how your interpretation of history shapes your identity. How revising and changing history shapes your identity.Blum, a historian of American history, and Netanyahu, a historian of Jewish history, have had their identities shaped by history they study. Blum is very happy with his upstate New York living, even when his parents and parents in law believe that he is not engaging in Judaism enough. Blum is an assimilated American who mostly participates in Judaism just socially, not religiously. Netanyahu is a nationalist Israeli who doesn't think too favorably of Blum's assimilation and isolation upstate. Netanyahu's criticism of American Jewry are from his Zionist beliefs that are shaped by the Jewish history he studies. The identities of these two men create a fascinating tension that is explored throughout the book.Check out this book if you are interested in history and history's relationship to political identity.Some moments you'll find yourself laughing, other moments pondering your existence. It's all great fun."

246,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/129273903-jakub-dovcik,Rating 5 out of 5,"What a fascinating, through-provoking, enjoyable and funny book this is. While at some sections a linguistic challenge, it is nevertheless a gripping, really genre-bending story that puts together a funny campus novel with a discourse on the nature and history of Jewishness, Judaism, Zionism and American-Jewish experience (and their various stereotypes and tropes), as well as the history of the Spanish Inquisition.The story is a fictionalised narrative of a job interview and a visiting lecture by Bibi Netanyahu's father, Benzion (or rather Ben-Zion), taking place in a small college in northwestern (not Upstate) New York State - something between Cornell (where Benzion actually taught) and to a very limited degree Yale (where Harold Bloom, whose actual memory the story was spun off, taught for ages). Narrated through the eyes of a taxation studies historian, professor Ruben Blum (""a Jewish historian - but not a historian of the Jews"") tasked with chaperoning the Netanyahus during their visit due to the fact that he was the first (ever) Jew at the school, whose family exhibits the conflicts and aspirations of the 1950s America, it is also somewhat a story of the crises of identity or identities, and the conflicts between religion and secularism.Some parts would be probably funnier or would bring greater insights had I been a part of any of the groups directly sharing the experiences presented in the narrative, I nevertheless found it amusing and the book's arguments about Benzion Netanyahu's scholarship and theses intriguing. Cohen's pure mastery is in creating a semi-fictional story taking place in 1960, with discussions of the history of Revisionist Zionism and Inquisition, that feels strikingly relevant and thought-provoking in today's (and 2021s) environment and situation, when one of the characters of the book has once again become the Prime Minister of Israel, this time relying on even more divisive platform and allies. And it makes it even better that Cohen deals with this real-life continuation of the characters and theses of the book in the appendix.An absolute joy to read, even better as the Fitzcarraldo Edition of the book feels like a piece of art. "
247,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11657479-richard-thompson,Rating 3 out of 5,"I don't know. I wanted to like it. The book is based on an anecdote told by Mr. Cohen's friend and admirer, the great Harold Bloom, who listed Mr. Cohen's ""Book of Numbers"" as the lone contemporary choice among books that we all must read. I slogged through ""Book of Numbers"" and found things to admire in it, but did not share Mr. Bloom's enthusiasm. I liked this one a bit better than ""Book of Numbers"" but overall had much the same reaction. The shifting narrative voice is good. It's clear that we can't completely trust the principal narrator, Ruben Blum, though he sees the world more clearly than most of the people around him. So we are given different perspectives on Netanyahu to fill out the portrait through two chapters comprised of recommendation letters from other scholars, and then Netanyahu is given the chance to damn himself with his own words in his job interview and his guest lecture to the academic community. I liked the the portrayal of the senior Netanyahu as a man who is personally repellant, difficult, thin skinned, overly academic, philosophically dangerous and having a family from hell, but still undeniably brilliant. As the anti-recommendation letter from Israel says about him, he is the kind of scholar who should be sent to a corner of the library to study and not allowed to teach or probably even to publish. As he expounds his theories, my reaction, which I think Mr. Cohen intended, was ""Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, but wait a minute, maybe not completely bullshit."" That's a common theme with the theories a lot of dangerous demagogues.Though the book is billed as a tribute to Harold Bloom, it is in some ways more a tribute to Philip Roth, with its prose style, its small town college setting and its obsessive Jewishness. It was only missing the sex, but that also makes a brief appearance at the end.Still in the end the book just didn't do it for me. I'm not entirely sure why. I think that it may be because it feels to me like Mr. Cohen is trying too hard. I feel the same way about Michael Chabon though Mr. Chabon's version of trying too hard expresses itself in different ways."

They are, essentially, the only Jewish people around. The father, a professor, is definitely the only Jewish faculty member. For the first 75% of the book, we‚Äôre given anecdote after anecdote about life among the gentiles. The stories vacillate between zany and bleak. Discrimination abounds in some unsurprising‚Äîand some shocking‚Äîways. Eventually, the protagonist professor is called upon to host a visiting Jewish professor from Israel who has applied for a job. Dr. Benzion Netanyahu shows up with his wife and three sons unexpectedly in tow. Chaos ensues. Confession time: a thing about me is that I don‚Äôt like to know too much about a book before I read it. General vibes maybe (spooky? funny? frustratingly cerebral?) but as far as plot goes, I like to be a ~blank page~.

My suspicion ‚Äì as it turned out, based in fact ‚Äì was this: in a few short years real-person fanfiction was unceremoniously booted from the shadows and went from being an object of scorn and critical ridicule (Fifty Shades of Grey) to winning a Pulitzer. I mean, technically RPF has already won a Booker (hi, Hilary Mantel!), but RPF has a special and specific flavour when it‚Äôs about people still living (Benjamin Netanyahu, junior, presented as an incontinent toddler), or within living memory ‚Äì and indeed, national icons, in the case of Jonathan Netanyahu. I don‚Äôt know enough about the history of Israel or its politics to say, but I suspect the portrait of Jonathan herein presented went down like a lead balloon among his true devotees. That aside, this was really well done. It probably does help that I know very little aside from name recognition about the characters/people in this story. It‚Äôs extremely funny in places:‚Äò[...] the Rosetta Stone and even the Bible, both of which ‚Äì most people forget ‚Äì are substantially just tax documents‚Ä¶‚Äô‚Äò[...] accounts of the Kennedy assassination, which give the sense of the mafia, the CIA, the KGB, and Marilyn Monroe all meeting up for a planning powwow in some screened-off back-booth at The 21 Club.‚Äô‚ÄòYou‚Äôd think they weren‚Äôt just electrocuting pigs in [the science department], but cooking up a bomb. Their time and effort would be better spent setting up a mint and developing novel methods of counterfeiting currency.‚Äô‚ÄòAnd so it might be more accurate to say that though Dr Netanyahu was certainly a believer, he didn‚Äôt believe in an all-powerful God so much as he believed in the all-powerful goys, who were obviously more accountable and identifiable to academia than God was.‚Äô‚Äò[...] Chapel, where weekly attendance was still mandatory for students and faculty alike, though the students were expected to derive spiritual benefit, while the faculty was just required to take roll.‚ÄôIt makes some pointed and fascinating remarks about topics like leftist snowflakes:‚ÄòSo many of my former students [...] were so tolerant of others‚Äô psychosocial fragilities and resentments as to become intolerable themselves, junior Torquemadas, sophomoric Savonarolas, finding fault with nearly every remark, finding bigotry and prejudice everywhere.‚ÄôI‚Äôm sorry, did you mean: Twitter?Also America:‚Äò[...] a world that brightened with the Enlightenment and steadily improved; a world that would continue to improve illimitably, as long as every country kept trying to be more like America and America kept trying to be more like itself.

They were the first who understood that all that was possible was a truth shared by the dominant people, the group or subgroup or family in power.‚Äô‚ÄòWhen it came to chronicling Jewish life, what difference could there be between Rome and Greece and Babylon? Weren‚Äôt they all just ultimately variations on Egyptian bondage, and all of their rulers essentially incarnations of the Pharoah?

271,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10687161-andy-klein,Rating 5 out of 5,"I enjoyed the book on many levels. First, it resonated with me culturally. While I didn't experience the degree of cultural stereotypical behavior satirized in the book, I definitely have experienced some, so it was amusing to see it so prominently displayed. Second, I found the portrait of life at a small, middle-tier, liberal arts college interesting and amusing. The entire description rang true for me. Middling, self-important intellectuals weaponizing their ""power"" wherever possible. I'm glad I didn't go into academics. I was particularly galled by the theology professor accusing Blum of theft of this pen and then calling him an empty suit (this of the same Blum who relieved him of embarrassment for not knowing any Hebrew). Third, I enjoyed the erudition of Cohen on the different types of Zionism as well as Netanyahu's (mis)interpretation of the Inquisition (including the non-recommendation letter from a colleague at Hebrew University). Fourth, I like Cohen's writing. He's excellent. Finally, like many, I found the portion on the Netanyahus to be my least favorite. There were a lot of cringeworthy moments (a la Michael Scott from The Office) that were funny at times, but it was too over the top for me. It needn't have been so unrealistic, down to the absurd ending, to have entertained. In fact, I think the reality of the Netanyahus' actual behavior would have improved the book. But I am gilding the lily here. This was an excellent, thought-provoking, well-written novel. Two post-scripts. I read an account by the author of one of his conversations with Professor Bloom. To say that the conversation ascended the lofty heights of literary scholarship above the head of this reader is a major understatement. The author definitely has real scholarly chops.And the book does explain, in part, Benjamin Netanyahu, who did more to set back the peace process in Israel with his policies than anyone else in Israeli history. After all, he was forged in the fires of his father's zealotry. He, of course, rather ironically, treated Palestinian Arabs with the same sort of treatment as the Middle-Age Spaniards treated Iberian Jews, albeit with less extermination, that his father spent 80 years decrying."

273,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/131627746-david-partikian,Rating 4 out of 5,"Although the parents of the narrator and his in-laws present ample comedic material in a farce about assimilated Jews living in an ‚Äúupstate‚Äù New York college town where the narrator works for a mediocre, anodyne college in somewhat of a sinecure, Joshua Cohen‚Äôs The Netanyahus reserves its most biting distain for bratty children since. . .well. . .Jane Austen. And while the children steal the show whenever they appear, the crux of the novel involves the easy-to-dislike patriarch of the Netanyahu clan‚Äîand the father of the former Prime Minister of Israel, the omnipotent right-wing politician, Benjamin Natanyahu. The elder Netanyahu, a controversial scholar on the Spanish Inquisition, breezes into town like a bull in a China shop and presents himself at various committees and college social functions where he is being considered for a tenure track position. He is rude to his host. His wife complains. His children wreak havoc. The result of a radicalized Jew in Goyland is the premise for this much-touted farce and slapstick of academic life interrupted by the arrival of an idiot savant and his uncouth family. Only a Jewish writer could get away with this satire of other Jews in today‚Äôs political climate. Joshua Cohen does a masterful job in weaving this tale, ostensibly once related to him by Harold Bloom, with tacit allusions to one of the bratty children as the future leader of Israel and‚Äîdepending on how one might think‚Äîeither a savior of his people or a ruthless leader and exploiter of Palestinians.As the epilogue, ‚ÄúCredits & Extra Credits,‚Äù makes clear this ostensible work of fiction is closely based on eminent Yale professor, Harold Bloom, acting as host for the then unknown scholar, Ben-Zion Netanyahu, who eventually wrote the controversial tome, The Origins of the Inquisition in Fifteenth Century Spain. While truth may be stranger than fiction, one can only intuit that Cohen tried to remain true to the anecdote related to him, with deviations mentioned in the epilogue. An entertaining college farce, not nearly as tragic and timeless as John Williams‚Äôs Stoner, but ultimately more gratifying than anything by Kingsley Amis."
274,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17501320-helga-cohen,Rating 4 out of 5,"In this blend of fiction and nonfiction, the winner of the Pulitzer Prize in fiction, Cohen wrote a literary story of a bleak figure of Benzion Netanyahu in a comical way. It is filled with historical and philosophical forays among college campus politics.The narrator of the story is economic historian Ruben Blum. He is the only Jewish faculty member at a small upstate New York college. Because he is Jewish, he must host Netanyahu who is an expert on inquisition Spain of which Blum knows little and assess his application for the hiring committee. The Netanyahu‚Äôs overwhelm the Blums and wreak havoc on their household when they have them at their house. Netanyahu brings his entire family including his wife and 3 children, Jonathan, Binyamin (Bibi) and Iddo. He calls the family ‚Äúthe Yahu‚Äôs‚Äù. Things begin to spin out of control for Blum and his family.Benzion Netanyahu discusses his thesis before the college faculty and administration. He states that anit-semitism in Iberian Spain during the inquisition was racialized. Even if a Jew converted to Catholicism, it was their bloodline that kept them from being true Christians. This was a view later adopted by Hitler. Hence if Judaism was racialized the solution was a state of their own. He then discusses Revisionist Zionist philosophy. He was a thinker with Jabotinsky-the founder of Revisionist Zionism. The tenets implied a conflict with Jews and Arabs in Palestine, Naziism would destroy European Jewry and Labor-Zionist socialist model would exist in Israel.The visit of the Netanyahu‚Äôs in New York was a real event and was told to the author by the American literary critic Harold Bloom. A reader can learn much about Jews in America and especially a non-Jewish community from this book. The account of this fictional college takes place in the end of the 1950‚Äôs. It is humorous with serious tones that teaches a message of history, identity, and Jewish conflict in America. "

Let me start by saying I liked it. There's no question about that. Especially as the book began, and as I got to know Professor Blum and his family. I found him an empathetic protagonist. The book was so amusing, and I was thinking all sorts of nice thoughts about what a funny people we Jews are. But then the parents and in-laws show up, and they're... extra. After that, the eponymous Netanyahus enter the novel and they're... awful. I mean, they are over-the-top, hard to believe awful! And this depiction made me feel more than a little uncomfortable. In a world so full of anti-Semitism, do we really need to fuel the fire? (To be emphatically clear, I do not believe Joshua Cohen to have an anti-Semitic bone in his body, to have done anything inappropriate in the writing of this novel, or to have had any bad intent.) It's actually unusual for me to feel uncomfortable when reading a book, and generally upon reflection, I find myself impressed by any author who can inspire that intense a reaction. I'm not sure if that was the author's intent, or if anyone else had a similar reaction. (Isn't it awesome that we all experience books our own way!) What IS obvious is that he was mining history for humor. But as with the best comic novels, there's a lot more going on under the surface, with all sorts of social commentary going on, with a soupcon of academic satire, and yes, well-depicted historical fiction.The author's note at the end, sharing historical notes and the story behind the story was tremendously interesting and enjoyable, and should not be missed.Other readers, what was your reaction to the book? Please share!"
276,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/136293945-elisa-kriza,Rating 1 out of 5,"The title of ‚ÄúThe Netanyahus‚Äù is click-bait: it lures you into buying a book which is irrelevant if you are interested in political satire about the famous (or infamous) Israeli political dynasty. The Netanyahu family appears in less(!) than half of the book, and when it does, it is only to wallow in stereotypes about boorish Israelis in a poor attempt at slap-stick comedy. This book is the epitome of literary laziness: instead of writing a biting satire about a controversial political dynasty, the book uses cheap toilet-humor, vulgarity, impoliteness, and stereotypes about different Jewish groups (Israeli, German, Eastern European) to try to sell this dreck as humorous literature. (Dreck is Yiddish for rubbish or excrement, by the way).When I started reading the book, I was shocked this won a literary prize. When I continued my perusal, I was stunned that this got published. It has many anachronisms (places things that don‚Äôt belong in an era into that era), its rendering of historical views on Spanish Jewry are puerile, and most of all ‚Äì it is utterly irrelevant. Who cares about a fake version of Harold Bloom (called Ruben Blum in the book) and a non-sensical account of an allegedly disastrous campus visit by a scholar called Ben-Zion Netanyahu, whom we know - although not from the book - that he did get hired in the end? After painfully treading through the book, I arrived at the author‚Äôs afterword in which he reveals the important historical role of the Netanyahus, which most of us know already. He would not have had to remind us of this, had he written a fine political satire in which this significance would have made itself known. What a waste of time and money! If you are looking for good satire, look elsewhere."

Despite his own ambivalence towards his Jewish American identity, he is asked to join a hiring committee considering employing Benzion Netanyahu, a [very real] professor who is a fervent Zionist first and historian of the Iberian Inquisition second. The novel culminates with the Blums hosting not just Netanyahu and his wife, but rather the whole family.I‚Äôm not sure why this book worked as well as it did for me, but, man, did it work. It is a fascinating meditation on Jewish American identity, especially in light of the still relatively new state of Israel. The story itself is a highly fictionalized account of an interaction that Harold Bloom had with Netanyahu. As a side note, Cohen states in the afterword that his characterization of the Netanyahus was meant to be realistic, even though the Blum family doesn‚Äôt have quite as clear of a historical counterpart.I found Blum to be a thoughtful narrator. Cohen weaves in modern issues, but is able to transcend the specifics and circle in on larger questions of identity that stand in every generation. That‚Äôs not to say that this isn‚Äôt still a deeply Jewish book - it is. However, the specificity grounds the narrative. Even though this is a cultural conversation where I have almost no skin in the game, it still felt like a vital conversation.I found Netanyahu‚Äôs character particularly well-realized. He is combative, but not mean. Just by reading about this one incident, I could see why he produced such extreme reactions from colleagues. He is a zealot, through and through. His scholarship has a divine prerogative backing it. Blum, as mild mannered as he is, didn‚Äôt stand a chance.Also, this book is legitimately funny. While it has a wry sense of humor through much of the book, once the Netanyahu‚Äôs arrive, it‚Äôs no holds barred. The kids, in particular, are hilarious in the same way It‚Äôs Always Sunny in Philadelphia is hilarious - you want to hate them. I don‚Äôt know how historically accurate these characterizations are, but imagining the current prime minister of Israel as an unruly delinquent made me laugh."

Funny and wise observations (e.g. on wokeness) and preparing the setting. We have a Jewish historian, Ruben Blum (based somehow on Harold Bloom), at a some small New York university. And he gets chosen because of his religion to be the guy responsible to make a visiting scholar from Israel, Benzion Netanyahu (and family), feel welcome. Very good indeed, even hilarious.Unfortunately, once Cohen gets from laying the grounds to actually telling a story it declines rapidly. He seems more comfortable in describing issues than in making people become alive through dialogs.It takes ages (and it is a small book) until the Netanyahus actually arrive. Before that there is e.g. a very long letter from a guy in Israel preparing (warning?) our story-teller for/of the man. Now, whenever Netanyahu is allowed to speak it gets interesting again (there is a nice monologue at the end of chapter IX). The lecture he finally gives is about his theory (apparently this is all real) that the inquisition in Spain and Portugal for the first time saw the Jews as defined by blood. The Jews were by the time actually converted to Catholicism. Why they did that is unclear to me, because if they needed the Jews as scapegoats why throw them out of the country? Anyway, interesting in itself.What an excellent writer Cohen is becomes apparent again in the final chapter/afterword ‚ÄúCredits & Extra-Credits‚Äù where we learn about the history of the family after the events described in the novel.

Very few even try, but this one certainly does--though some of the musical interludes were way too long (the chapter breaks, maybe?).I am always ready to admit my frustration with books that are ""based on history"" ie, present real people in real-ish situations and write around it. I hate this, especially when featuring living people or their immediate descendants. It is fake history, there are no standards, and often presents a negative image (which may or may not be accurate--but there are no sources!!). So, much of this story annoyed me. BUT--the sections that can truly be considered a ""campus novel"" were hilarious. The politics of departments, the infighting in class schedules and the ownership of subjects were absolutely hilarious. I truly laughed, especially in the section where Blum explains that though his history department has a reputation as being progressive ahead of its time in that it focused less on Europe, it wasn't because of any anti-colonial belief. It was because the chair. wants to be the only Europeanist in the department. Europe was his, and he would not hire anyone who might compete with him. This is so hilariously believable AND it is also hilariously believable that that would get twisted into the department being ahead of its time (when really it was the opposite--old WASP can;t tolerate any ""competition"").So--this evened out for me. Good audio production, hilarious and infuriating sections. "

Set in 1960, on the campus of a would-be Ivy League college, the place of American assimilation, it is comedic and dramatic, polemic, and provides an alternate history of Jewish migration and assimilation, and a new view on the Spanish Inquisition, and highlights the tensions within the Jewish identity. Though the parents of Professor of History Ruben Blum are still religious Jews, he has left the Bronx and his upbringing behind, settled for the last couple of years with his wife and daughter in this small upstate New York town.

This book is a far cry from the soft beauty of Potok‚Äôs work. The Netanyahus chronicles a fictionalized visit by Ben-Zion Netanyahu (father of Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu) to Corbin College for a job interview. Netanyahu brings his entire crazy family along and stays with the family of the college‚Äôs only other Jewish professor, Ruben Blum. What is the author‚Äôs point in writing such an account? That is a good question. There are passages of Jewish history that seemed out of place and were far too in depth for my simple layman‚Äôs mind. There were passages of family drama that were quite funny and mildly entertaining. Then there were passages, including the ending, that were just disturbing. None of these seemed to come together in any cohesive way to convey a point, at least in my opinion. Perhaps that was Cohen‚Äôs objective‚Äîto portray the life of Jewish Americans as scattered and feeling out of place? The Jewish people have suffered more than their share of hardship and dispersion, so maybe that is part of the purpose?

The book starts with the self effacing and over rationalization that will always feel like home in its familiarity. At once I knew the book would ring true‚Äîif only because it rings close to home. The theme explored that echos in my mind is repeated history, the cyclical nature of the oppression of the jewish people and how that narrative was used to excuse occupation. In the spirit of that theme, I could not help but wonder why the narrator, the funny self aware yet ultimately powerless somehow charming man, always seems to narrate our stories‚Äîwhich is acknowledged by the author. Not only is oppression ‚Äòconstant‚Äô, but also the stereotypical man who is deemed palatable enough to narrate them to critical acclaim. Ultimately, I am left with a hole where feelings should be. I knew only that Netanyahu is an extremist looking to exterminate a people; what should I do with this new information that exists between fact and fiction?"
287,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I went into this without expecting much--can't even remember why I decided to put the book on my TBR--but was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it.The hilarious story of a visit by Benzion Netanyahu and his family to a small college in semi-rural New York looks at Jewish-American identity in the post-World War 2 years. It is a blend of fiction and non-fiction. The main character is fictional, but of course Benzion Netanyahu, his wife, and his three children were very real. And Benzion Netanyahu did look for an academic position in the US and ended up teaching for a few years at Cornell. The writing is wonderful, even if at times the story didn't completely hold together, and the ending struck me as somewhat unbelievable (I hope the ending is fiction!). The Netanyahu's scholarship is presented as being somewhat controversial, and indeed there is still controversy around his conclusions. Nevertheless, I think Cohen has a little bit of sympathy for Benzion, even if he is presented as being overbearing and comical at times. Cohen obviously has no sympathy with Benzion's wife and three children. They are presented as monsters.The Afterward was very interesting and tells about how the genesis of the book came about through his conversations with Harold Bloom, who actually hosted the Netanyahus. I assume that everything in the Afterward is true, but who knows!Anyway, this novel is both funny and serious and far from lightweight.Strange that I'm reading it now....."
288,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"New favorite book of the year. The Netanyahus is incredibly erudite--often esoteric--but its sitcom-like humor and its level-headed and self-deprecating narrator ensure that the book never feels pretentious and inaccessible. And Cohen makes it incredibly apparent why this history is relevant today, making the book‚Äôs obscure historical episodes feel vitally relevant.Likewise, the Netanyahus is both vehemently anti-Zionist but never dogmatic, holistic in its depiction of Zionism's origins in centuries of violent anti-Semitic persecution and its tragic manifestation in an aggressive and paranoid State of Israel. Joshua Cohen takes issue with Zionism for an oft-ignored reason in our climate of progressive anti-Zionism: the ideology's insistence on the erasure of Jewish life in the Diaspora. At a moment in which some of the world‚Äôs most staunch Zionists live in the Diaspora--especially the U.S.--Cohen reminds us, by brilliant way of Bibi Netanyahu's father Ben-Zion, that Zionism is explicitly founded on a disgust for Diaspora Jewry. (Which helps to explain, perhaps, why America‚Äôs most fervent Zionists are not Jews but right-wing Christian nationalists).But, at its core, The Netanyahus is a family drama and a comedy of manners. Cohen's ability to balance both the intellectual and emotional aspects of its narrative makes the Netanyahus one of the best books I've read on Israel, American-Jewish identity, and postwar America in general."

The intellectual level of the writing, often, bordered on, what I would consider, an advanced academic grad school level and discussed the philosophy and history of the Jewish people. But the story itself was exceptional. It's about a Jewish professor, Ruben Blum, at Corbin College, a small upstate New York school, who teaches history, but not Jewish history. His is the only Jewish family in the town and so he often has to put up with some insulting conduct by some of the other residents but he seems to deal with it all right. He is enlisted by the school to assist in the interviewing process for a new prospect for the school, Benzion Netanyahu. The humor in the story was outrageously funny as Cohen took every stereotypical Jewish trait, that comedians use, and ran with it. It was hilarious enough when he described visits by his parents and his wife's parents but when he described the visit by Netanyahu and his wife, it was absolutely laugh-out-loud funny. A great book!"

Either way, it wasn't my favorite reading experience. I found myself having to stop multiple times per page to look up words I didn't know the meaning of, which‚Äìnot to toot my own horn‚Äìis rare for me.I didn't feel any kind of connection for any of the characters and, at times, this felt more like a history textbook than fiction. Also, I'm confused by the non-fiction aspects of this book. Obviously, Ben-Zion Netanyahu and his family are real people, and he really did visit an American college. I don't know, it just feels like an awful lot of liberties being taken with real people, not all of whom are historical yet.But aside from my qualms about what can rightfully be called fiction, I just didn't enjoy reading The Netanyahus. I couldn't wait to be done with it. So many of the reviews call it ""hilarious"" or a ""comedy."" Sure, some humorous things happen, but they're so bogged down in over-intellectualism that I couldn't enjoy them. It's a hard pass on this one for me."
292,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1999603-elliot-ratzman,Rating 4 out of 5,"What an insane novel! I am wondering if anyone outside of the world of Jewish letters‚Äîprofessors, rabbis, readers‚Äîwill appreciate how wicked and clever and spot-on this send-up (or is it?) of the Family Netanyahu is; a send up, as well, of the micropolitics of academia. The novel gives us long recommendation letters, job files, and robust‚Äîif somewhat inaccurate‚Äîlectures: all hilarious. This is a cutting critique of Zionism and the untamed Klingon-like Israeli character, devastating and cathartic. The Netanyahus are ‚ÄúYahus‚Äù: rude, pushy, violent, arrogant, obnoxious. The prose is perfect, and littered with words I had to look up every few pages. I was exhilarated by this exaggerated take-down of both right-wing Zionism and pompous Jewish melancholy. The WASPs don‚Äôt fare much better, they are to a person mediocre, mendacious and petty. Apparently this episode is based on an account told by scholar Harold Bloom to Cohen. Interesting to read with Netflix‚Äôs English dept comedy ‚ÄúThe Chair.‚Äù"
293,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/145993869-jack-kast,Rating 4 out of 5,"The more I ponder The Netanyahus, the more I like it. At first glance, it is not the type of novel that strikes one as notable due to the prose alone, even though parts of it are rather beautiful. I loved the philosophical arguments raised in this book and the subtleties in approaching them. For example, when Netanyahu answered the professor about whether his work is revisionist, he gave a completed revisionist definition of the word revisionist and couched it in some overarching theory that there are no truths, only contingencies. I think that the intersection between contingent 'truths' and Jewish identity that Netanyahu examines is an interesting one. I think that in a world where Jewish history is told via non-Jews, it is certainly valid that history as a study of linear progression and time fall flat. The professor's thesis that the establishment of Zion, or Israel, is that vital declaration of Jewish agency that enables the beginning of Jewish history intrigues me and makes an interesting political innuendo about the absolutism of today's Benjamin Netanyahu. If Benjamin Netanyahu's father really believed in this self-referential amorality ends-justify-the-means type ideology, it's easy to see how the prime minister was able to throw any regard for human life and well-being to the wayside. Beyond the political and philosophical quandaries that the book raises, I loved some of the characters. All the grandparents made me laugh a lot, as did Judith. A weird and very smart slice-of-life."

Damn interesting themes and political/religious discussions though.I know it‚Äôs a very very loose characterization of Harold Bloom, but just imagining Harold Bloom in these scenarios makes it 1000x funnier.Add him to the ‚ÄúGreat Jewish Writers from New Jersey list‚Äù along with Philip Roth and‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.that‚Äôs it."

The campus novel colliding with an anecdote about the Netanyahus staying with Harold Bloom and making a literal mess was an interesting premise. It almost felt like an over-the-top Royal Tennenbaums or something written by the Coen brothers with a strongly Jewish slant. I liked the exploration of Jewish identity in America, which was very central to the novel; the collision of a secular Jewish academic with a Zionist academic was interesting. It is so well written and hilarious, but I think the humor will appeal to those with a specific sense of humor: black, absurd, and bizarre humor. Not everyone will find it funny, and there were super crass moments I could have done without. Do I love it? Do I hate it? I truly don‚Äôt know!

I have a good vocabulary and after a while, Cohen‚Äôs use of obscure words became pretentious and annoying. There‚Äôs a core of truth to this story. Benzion Netanyahu was a historian who studied Iberian persecution of Jews, and did spend time at Cornell, represented as Corbin University in this book. There was much that I liked. I liked the family scenes, the Jewish tropes, they made me laugh. But in many ways I felt as if the book itself veered off into anti-semitism. The depiction of the Benzion Netanyahus personally as yahoos, and their vulgar characters, was over the top, not in a good way. "

There are long (and I mean long) stretches of almost-intellectual ramblings--ramblings about the state of history, of Israel, of Judaism, of academia--that break up long (and I mean long) scenes that play like _Seinfeld_ out-takes (""The Crazy Jewish Parents,"" or ""The Nutty Jewish Job Candidate""). I was engaged by some of the ramblings, and laughed at some of the _Seinfeld_ moments, but since none of the characters felt especially real, I was never emotionally engaged. But perhaps emotional engagement was never on Cohen's dance card, here? Perhaps his goal was to place the intellectual gymnastics and the slapstick family dramas side-by-side, to illustrate the ways the two seemingly very different worlds are actually similar. "

The antagonist only makes an appearance at the halfway point. Before that it is ramblings from the main character. Even in the last extra credits where the author explains tha origins of this fictioanlized account, he goes on and on for 90% of the time. Then drops the actual story.I guess the true story behind the fictionalized version, while engaging, isn‚Äôt all that long so the author chose the path of using fancy sentences as filler.

As a converso scholar, I came for the iberian history and was not disappointed. Cohen has a comprehensive understanding of Benzion Netanyahu's contentious claims about the inquisition. He shows how this dusty corner of Jewish history can be remolded and ultimately shape the birth and policies of a nation state. There were some aspects that seem exaggerated--Blum's family confused me and I didn't get a proper read on his wife and daughter, BUT the character of the Netanyahus is crystal clear (and more compelling in my opinion). I knew the real life inspiration for this book but later found out that this visit did in fact occur.

The Netanyahus are real‚Äîthough one son is missing‚Äîbut Corbin College and Ruben Blum, the narrator, are not.

If I had even the slightest idea of this book's premise, I could've circumvented my initial struggle to grasp both the author's style and the plot. However, I prefer to dive into novels and after this mishap I can't see myself changing my ways. Joshua Cohen's ""The Netanyahus"" is a melodrama based on real events and people where he mixes serious intellectual and academic topics with humor. Cohen expanded into a novel a very short period in time, something I don't particularly enjoy in books but find impressive and interesting nonetheless. The main character, Ruben Blum, is a steadfast rock, or better yet a control in an experiment, as the reader is taken through a whirlwind of both personalities and events.

But I've long had some opinions in re: Harold Bloom and Benjamin Netanyahu so to get an unexpected glimpse at the crossing of their paths was pretty fascinating. Having read all of the Pulitzer winners for fiction, I look forward to seeing what the newest one brings each year, and this one qualifies as capturing a uniquely American experience. "

Culture, set in academia, dry wit, great little sound effects in the audio, a good annoying antagonist, and pretty good storytelling; I enjoyed this book. I know practically nothing about the context, so I also appreciated it as historical fiction. Given my lack of background knowledge, though, I know I missed a few meanings (I could even identify sometimes that there was more being said, I just didnt know what it was), and I hate that üòÜ Regardless of your background knowledge, i recommend for a good read; it's probably all the more enjoyable if you have the right background knowledge."
312,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I was expecting a very different novel based on the title and was expecting an historical fiction. Joshua Cohen's book, The Netanyahus, was quite challenging and at times frustrating with the ramblings of the main character, Ruben Blum, especially in the first 3 chapters. The laborious sentences were packed with vocabulary and historical references that forced me to reference google frequently (obviously I am not an intellectual). I learned a lot however, and laughed at the ridiculousness of the ""yahoo"" characters. I am not sure what was fact or fiction or vice versa. I have lots of questions and would love to discuss this book with others. "
313,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"Quite funny but maybe too much of a caricature for me. I was taken aback by it really. This topic (Israel) can be so explosive that the tone here, very agressive, hidden but not hidden behind humour doesn‚Äôt seem like literature even if the prose is great. But more like an attack, a one sided view for one face characters. I like cynicism in general but it was not a great use of it since all characters lack depth and colors. I don‚Äôt understand why it has won the Pulitzer this year. But otherwise it‚Äôs a good book. Especially if you are not a fan of the Netanyahu political views. "
314,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11665853-robin,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book is a few steps above a 5-star rating. Considering that it just won the Pulitzer, it should receive a 25-star rating. It is a smart telling of an obscure event with the Netanyahu family, when Bibi was just a kid. It is also about the Blum family - a family with its own issues and dilemmas - trying to figure out their place in a world where they are the token Jews. The writing is excellent, often funny, and also stretched my vocabulary (I had to look up a bunch of words!). Now I definitely need to read the two other books by Joshua Cohen that I have on my shelves. "

I hadn‚Äôt heard about it even though in is the winner of the 2022 Pulitzer Prize for fiction! I guess I was attracted by the simple blue cover and curious about its subject matter.Don‚Äôt miss this book! It‚Äôs a gem! It‚Äôs one of the funniest books I have read in. David Lodge type of way! It‚Äôs incredibly well written, smart and on top of all of that I learned a whole bunch of things!So for me this was out of the blue, I had no expectations when I started it, absolutely brilliant!"

318,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Netanyahus was the first Joshua Cohen book that I've read - I was attracted by the familiarity (and mark of good quality) of the Fizcarraldo edition at Daunt Books, enough to take a chance on a book based on the back cover mention of Cohen's blending of fact and fiction, which had a Kiarostami ring to me. I will now be reading everything he's published. The Netanyahus is up there with Sophie's Choice in my list of revered books. Cohen's writing is simply brilliant, and the reader who might not have the patience for looking up a new word here and there, or find it too 'rambling' (as I read in a review below), will be rewarded in the second half of the book by scenes that are universally hilarious and beautifully based in truth. You don't have to know or care about Benjamin Netanyahu or his father or Israel or Judaism to love this book."
319,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91820018-katy-smith,Rating 5 out of 5,What a bizarre fiction/non-fiction story about the Netanyahu family. I always think I learn more about people by knowing their parents and the same is true for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Yahoos are wild and so disrespectful. Reading this story (not knowing how much is true) makes me despise the ‚Äúnutty yahoos‚Äù even more. This book is well deserving of the Pulitzer. Very different from everything else I‚Äôve read but also gives a pretty good history of occupied Palestine. 
320,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"Simply dazzling - Cohen has it all as a writer. This funny, literate, bracing, acerbic inspired-by-a-true-event tale of the elder Netnayhau (father of the future Israeli PM) visiting a small New England university for a job interview is this year's Pulitzer Prize winner for fiction. It's not for everyone, by any means, but if you are interested in Jewish history and politics, or a campus comedy filled with self-loathing, slapstick, biting characterization, and wit, you might enjoy it.

321,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91278638-martin-henson,Rating 5 out of 5,"Desperately wanted to give this book four stars, if only because I fear I give too many books five. But the problem is that Fitzcaraldo has the golden touch, and only seems to publish the very best.It's a very clever, funny, and beautifully crafted book which ratchets up the intensity and pace as it progresses. As the last 100 pages unfolded my mouth started to drop towards the floor, quickly followed by my popping eyes. Magnificent!The author's epilogue is hardly an afterthought - its revelations and historical accounts retain the cleverness and humour - and the final true-life letter will have you in stitches."

It‚Äôs one of those books that‚Äôs both entertaining and profound. I was not expecting a Pulitzer Prize winner to be so enjoyable and accessible. It‚Äôs a book that‚Äôs clever but not at the expense of being entertaining. I love books that open up new knowledge or insight to me, I felt that I came away after reading this book with a better understanding of Jewish history and culture."
323,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5292871-olga-zilberbourg,Rating 5 out of 5,"An enjoyable romp of a novel that at the end explains its conceit as a retelling of an anecdote from the life of Harold Bloom. It's enjoyable to read high gossip about famous personages -- and as far as gossip goes, this was delivered very effectively and with a good serving of history on the side. I listened to this in audio book version and didn't love the musical interludes, but the narration was strong and enjoyable. Loved the fun narrative ruptures here, the long quotations from highly improbable recommendation letters, and the last chapter that pulls up the curtain."

I thought this would focus on the totally non-fictional life and ruling of Benjamin N. And co. I was very pleasantly surprised, however. I thought this book was incredible well written, and the voice actor for the e-book was perfect - not dramatic, no annoying voices. I‚Äôd re-read the audio book OR pick up a physical book‚Ä¶ this book was delicious. "

Although several characters are invented to ease the retelling of the Netanyahu‚Äôs story, it reads like a brilliant memoir.While at first I was unsure what to make of a book of this nature, I left it feeling as though I had been transported to upstate New York in the 1960s. The story is compelling, at times saddening, at others hilarious, and overall a wonderful reading experience. 5/5"

Most interesting parts were the satirical takes on BZ‚Äôs views on Jewish history but they weren‚Äôt satirical enough, too deadpan.

The final Credits & Extra Credits were not only necessary but also highly entertaining. A different kind of campus novel, which probably requires a re-reading. "
328,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10848-mike,Rating 3 out of 5,"Undoubtedly well written, just not preferred writing style. I fully understand the Pulitzer committee awarding Cohen the prestigious award, too. Cohen's story of the Netanyahus' visit to a private liberal arts college in Upstate New York had very entertaining moments. The titular Netanyahus don't make an appearance until more than halfway through the story, and that happens to be the best part of the book. But Cohen's almost stream of consciousness reminded me too much of Philip Roth, and that's not a positive."
329,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/119159209-artyshock,Rating 4 out of 5,"Some good writing here. The Yahus are extremely unattractive bunch. I can go so far as to guarantee that you‚Äôll be clenching your jaw (and occasionally a fist) from the very moment they appear in the picture. It would be a funny story, and in many regards it is, but the sheer vividness and reality of these characters and the wreck that they present is one that cultivates uneasiness, which remains long after the book is over, towering above the comic and lighthearted bits.
