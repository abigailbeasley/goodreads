Whatever you do, don't read it as it will haunt you. This is a long review but it behooves you to stick with it. To begin, you have to touch each and every possession and ask yourself if it brings you joy. If it doesn't, it needs to be discarded. Do you know how hard it is to summon joy for beige underwear or Neosporin? Yet summon you must. I like my carrot peeler but is joy too strong a word? It gets tougher. Not only must you ""apply hands"" to every piece of clothing while checking for your joy response, you must fold your clothes in very specific ways in order to find each piece's ""sweet spot"". I never knew that ""Every piece of clothing has it's own 'sweet spot' where it feels just right"". This will lead to an historical moment when ""your mind and the piece of clothing connect."" Don't forget to thank your clothes for protecting your body. Thank your accessories for making you beautiful. ""Express your appreciation to every item that supported you during the day.""Never, never ""ball up your socks"" as they can't get their much deserved rest that way. They need to breathe a sigh of relief. You must visit your off season clothes to ""let them know you care and look forward to wearing them when they're next in season. This kind of communication helps your clothes stay vibrant and keeps your relationship with them alive longer.""Everything must be stored standing up rather than laid flat. ""Stacking weakens and exhausts the things that bear the weight of the pile. Just imagine how you would feel if you were forced to carry a heavy load for hours?""You must empty your hand bag every day.""Being packed all the time, even when not in use, must feel something like going to bed with a full stomach."" When you get a new phone, it is kind to text your old one with a message of thanks for its service.Every single thing must be in its assigned place before you go to bed."" Have you ever thought about what it would be like to have no fixed address?"" It is equally important for our possessions to have ""that assurance that there is a place for them to return to.""If we greet our house properly it will "" be happy to tell me what the family no longer needs and where to put the things remaining so that the family can be comfortable and happy in this space."" Not sure if you do this before or after applying hands and checking your joy response. It did come near the end of the book, if that helps.So what do the things that get discarded for not sparking joy feel? ""I think they simply want to leave. Lying forgotten in the closet, they know better than anyone else that they are not bringing you joy."" The people who tidy as this book recommend experience a change in their appearance. ""Their figures are more streamlined, their skin is more radiant, and their eyes shine brighter.""Unfortunately, my eyes are crossed, I've gained 10 pounds, and I feel hives ready to pop. I had no idea when I picked up this pretty little book that it was going to necessitate my search for a live-in psychiatrist. I had NO freaking idea that I was squashing the self-esteem of my possessions. I can NOT find those folding sweet spots and everything in my drawers is in a mosh pit. My hand bag looks sad every time I walk by its nightly fullness. My socks are falling down. I'm not sure why. I hate the word joy now. I'm sleep deprived. My possessions call out to me for help but I don't know if they want me to summon joy or if they want to leave. The other day my husband heard me thanking my underwear for staying up all day. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be married."
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken,Rating 2 out of 5,"How do I get into messes like this? Reading books that have words like ""tidying"" in their title, I mean. Well, there's a story behind it.The Good Wife and I are trying to purge, to clean up after decades of marriage, kids, three moves, etc. ""We've got to do something about all this stuff we keep bumping into or dusting,"" I keep saying, ""something more than the penny ante efforts we're doing so far.""Enter a New York Times feature on THIS book, calling it the greatest thing since sliced sushi:http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/gar...""That does it,"" I told my wife. ""We're both reading this on the Kindle.""""You first,"" she said.I should've known right there. It was kind of like the puppy we picked out 10 years ago. ""He's a little mouthy,"" the guy at the shelter said. You'd think an English major would know foreshadowing when he heard it.Anyway, I'm reading this book and reading this book and saying to myself, ""The Times article IS the book. Free, too! Why am I reading all this filler, this clutter, these words in need of TIDYING up?""That said, I should give the book a star back just for the punch line, ""Does it spark joy?"" It's what you say when holding some up-for-tossing item in your hand. ""Does it spark joy?"" If not, heave and ho, my friends.Just now, I looked around the kitchen with my wife at my side. ""Nothing in here sparks joy...,"" I said.""I'm in the kitchen,"" she replied firmly.""No, no. Stuff, I mean.""Anyway, that's the gist of the book. As for her system, Marie Kondo goes into houses (she does this for a living) and starts her ritual by singing its praises. Then she practices the praise of reduction. She's grateful in her own home, too. For instance, she brings her purse home from work, empties it, puts stuff in its place (fear not, it has a place), then thanks her purse for another job well done. In the morning it all goes back in. Says it extends the life of her purse. You tell me -- ""tidying"" or tidying?Marie also says to congregate everything by category in one spot. Start with clothes. Never room by room where clothes may be found, but ALL clothes from the WHOLE house in ONE spot on the floor (if you have a room big enough, and you don't). Now hold each piece of clothing, one by one. ""Does this spark joy?"" Bzzt.(And that's just the clothes... you still have books, papers, mementos, and personal stuff ahead and in that order.)The only other thing I recall is hanging stuff in the closet. Light clothes (color, material) left, darker and heavier right. That's after you've tossed 87.9% of it.Anyway, my wife is getting cute now. ""Done,"" I said. ""Now you.""""Why don't you tell me the highlights instead,"" she said, already spooked by the ""spark-any-joy?"" talk.""Wha-?""Yep. Just like the former puppy that by now has consumed half the house because he's ""a little mouthy."" Should've seen it coming from the get-go -- the minute I got the ""you first"" line. Bottom line: You can't ""tidy"" a house in ruthless Marie Kondo fashion when you're 40% of a pair (the other 60% having a Security Council Veto, among other super powers). But that's marriage... a very untidy thing."
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6536286-ariel,Rating 5 out of 5,"""You will never use spare buttons."" WORDS WE ALL NEED TO HEAR.I really thoroughly loved this book. I've always been interested in minimalism - trying to stop material goods being the things that bring us happiness, and not owning more than we need - and picked this book up after hearing a few people around me enjoy it. I was hoping it would give me a few tips on how to lead a more clutter-free existence, and while it accomplished that, it also did so much more. The thing that most stuck me about this book was the immense respect that the author, (who feels like my friend after reading this, a gentle companion through this process), shows to all possessions. She understands that this is an emotional process, and her ideas are not about guilt. She isn't saying ""You're a fool for allowing all of this garbage into your life! Get rid of it all at once!"" Instead she's saying ""All of these things came into your life for a reason, take your time considering them, and then thank them and let them go onto the next stage of existence."" It's all so kind and loving and made me not feel guilty or fear the process.I also really liked the structure of this book. It has a solid introduction, a clear process, a section of tips, and then a conclusion. It's very straightforward and doesn't feel complex or gimmicky. It all feels like common sense. It also had key points in bold which helped in figuring out the main thesis of different sections.The book focuses on tidying your house, but for me (and most of the people reading this) we don't own a house, we own one room. I don't think this matters for two reasons. Firstly, the ideas and methods in this book can be perfectly applied to your space, no matter how extensive it is. It's all about creating the most positive space imaginable, and that is very achievable with just one room. Secondly, this book was very much a philosophy. It's about learning to reflect on the relationship between you and your possessions and is something I will carry with me moving forward in life. Someday I will move out of my parents house and into my own house/apartment and I am extremely grateful that I have read this book and will be able to start that journey with this knowledge.Thank you, Marie, for sharing what you've learned, I'm very excited to start my journey of only surrounding myself with things that I love and bring me joy."

Here are two take-aways that will stay with me:If it does not spark joy, throw it out.And: ""My basic principle for sorting papers is to throw them all away.""Believe me - I have been throwing away (and selling, and donating to Goodwill) with a vengeance for the past few days, and tidying. I refuse to fold my socks though. Folding socks is for people with all the time in the world."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4115019-sheri,Rating 2 out of 5,"""Personally, I recommend hanging sponges outside, such as on the veranda.""Quite possibly the funniest line I have ever read in a book. Because she is dead serious.Although there were several helpful sections about how to declutter and organize your home, much of this book is ridiculously funny. This woman obviously has no children (and no life) as she speaks to all her inanimate objects daily, empties her purse EVERY SINGLE DAY, and doesn't own a dish rack, preferring instead to put all her dishes ""on the veranda"" to dry. She's also afraid of hurting her socks' feelings. I gave it two stars because I do like the idea of getting rid of things that don't bring you joy and I like the idea of stacking things vertically. And I'm taking Marie Kondo's advice and getting rid of this book. It most definitely does not spark joy. Well. . . maybe in an ironic way. :)"
7,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book just spoke to me, for whatever reason, although I can see why others might not get much out of it. No matter what the subject is, I love reading books by people that are truly passionate about the subject matter, and one thing is for sure: Marie Kondo is passionate about tidying. Despite all of that, this book isn't really about tidying, at its core. It's about living very intentionally and allowing your surroundings and possessions to become an expression of yourself. If that last sentence made you roll your eyes, skip this book, but if you like the idea of finding meaning in the things that you own, you'll enjoy this. "
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,Rating 3 out of 5,"This review was delayed because I was busy tidying up. Yesterday I finished this charming little book about the Japanese art of decluttering and organizing, and this morning I woke up filled with ENTHUSIASM and was ready to open up every drawer and every closet and to simplify, simplify, simplify. Of course, such projects always take longer than you expect. I was trying to follow the spirit of Marie Kondo's guidelines, which involve handling each one of your possessions and asking: Does this spark joy? If it gives you happiness, keep it. Otherwise, get rid of it.Imagine yourself living in a space that contains only things that spark joy. Isn't this the lifestyle you dream of? Keep only those things that speak to your heart. Then take the plunge and discard all the rest. By doing this you can reset your life and embark on a new lifestyle.After spending most of the day doing that, my donation pile had grown to several bags of clothes, a big bag of kitchen items, and a hefty stack of books. The most difficult things to sort were the books (a problem I bet most people reading this can relate to) and fortunately, Marie had some good advice on this:The most common reason for not discarding a book is ""I might read it again."" Take a moment to count the number of favorite books that you have actually read more than once ... In the end, you are going to read very few of your books again ... So when deciding which books to keep, forget about whether you think you'll read it again or whether you've mastered what's inside. Instead, take each book in your hand and decide whether it moves you or not. Keep only those books that will make you happy just to see them on your shelves, the ones that you really love.I have many, many books that make me happy, and I will keep those. But when I looked more closely at my shelves, I do have a fair number of books that I can pass on because they have served their purpose. Which brings me to one of my favorite aspects of Marie's advice, which is that when you get rid of something, you take a moment to appreciate the item and how it served you.Each object has a different role to play. Not all clothes have come to you to be worn threadbare. It is the same with people. Not every person you meet in life will become a close friend or lover. Some you will find hard to get along with or impossible to like. But these people, too, teach you the precious lesson of who you do like, so that you will appreciate those special people even more. When you come across something that you cannot part with, think carefully about its true purpose in your life. You'll be surprised at how many of the things you possess have already fulfilled their role. By acknowledging their contribution and letting them go with gratitude, you will be able to truly put the things you own, and your life, in order. In the end, all that will remain are the things that you really treasure.Marie is apparently a very successful and sought-after organizing consultant in Japan, and her book has numerous stories about her clients' efforts to declutter. Marie says many of her clients have a life-changing experience doing this. For example, after getting rid of all the books that didn't spark joy, one of Marie's clients realized that all of the books she kept were about social work, and that what she truly enjoyed in life was helping others, so she changed her career. Marie said this kind of epiphany often ocrrus because once we clear away the clutter in our lives, we can better see what truly matters to us.The anecdotes and guidelines were helpful, and this was a pleasant read, even though the Japanese-to-English translation was a bit stilted at times. I doubt I will take every piece of advice Marie gives —- for example, she recommends putting all of your clothes on the floor, and then sorting them — but I appreciated the spirit of it.Now I have to decide whether or not to keep this book: Does it spark joy?"

The Written Review
:  The question of what you want to own is actually the question of how you want to live your life.
By no exaggeration, Marie Kondō has spent her entire life tidying.She tidied when she was a child up until her adulthood - and over those decades, she's learned a thing or two about keeping a house clean.
The space in which we live should be for the person we are becoming now, not for the person we were in the past.
 And the secret? Joy.That's right. The key to a clean house is joy - what makes us happy and how can we bring that more fully into our lives.She's taken on clients from all over the world and has developed the ""Konmarie Method"" to tidying - starting with the impersonal (clothing) and proceeding into the memorable (keepsakes/heirlooms). She's dealt with a wide variety of clients over the years, and has developed instincts for the best way to clear a house. And (more importantly) how to keep a house clean.
Clutter is caused by a failure to return things to where they belong. Therefore, storage should reduce the effort needed to put things away, not the effort needed to get them out.
She wants to make the world a happier, healthier and (above all) a tidier place.Overall - I liked this one!For as long as I could remember, my closet(s) practically overflowed with clothing (from years and years of keeping outfits ""just-in-case"").
But when we really delve into the reasons for why we can’t let something go, there are only two: an attachment to the past or a fear for the future.
After reading her book/watching her Netflix series, I was able to cut out all those extra clothes and really make my wardrobe manageable! One thing I found uniquely associated with her method is the way she integrates joy into her tidying. According to Marie, everything in your house should bring you joy - even the little things. And while that seems impractical when first thinking of it (who ever thought ""joy"" when they look at a potato peeler?), the more I thought about it...the more I realized she was right.Taking the potato peeler example (which I saw a few GR reviewers throwing it around), if you don't feel joy holding it...try getting rid of it.Next time you want to make mashed potatoes...think about how fun it is to use a knife to skin them. How many nicks you get on your hands. The loss of potato because of your awkward peeling.A few rounds of that and gosh darn, you'll become grateful (even joyful) to have a potato peeler in your hands again.And if you don't? Then I guess you never needed it in the first place and now your house has one less useless gadget.Some of her methods seem...questionable...especially to westerners. For example, she recommends thanking each piece of clothing that you get rid of for a job well-done.It seems silly, right? Utterly ridiculous. And yet...it works.At the end of my clothing un-haul, I was left with several shirts that I honestly didn't want...but I also didn't want to give them away. (You know the type. They hang out in the back of your wardrobe for years...and yet no matter how little you wear them...they're always still there).So, I tried the Konmarie method. I held each one in my hand - thinking, Does this bring me joy?If the answer was yes, I kept it. If the answer was no, I thanked the article of clothing for being in my life and for giving me what I needed when I first bought it. And then I let it go.And yes, I felt silly doing it - and I locked the bedroom door so that the hubby didn't know I was doing it - but at the same time, I felt closure. I was accepting that the clothes had no part in my current life and that holding onto them any longer wasn't helping them or me. It was time to set them free.The only thing I disagreed upon was books. Marie believes (strongly) that books go in and out of lives and they aren't really to be kept.
For books, timing is everything. The moment you first encounter a particular book is the right time to read it. To avoid missing that moment, I recommend that you keep your collection small.
Hmmm...does (literally) having a bookshelf in every room of the house (excluding the bathroom) count? (And note: the only reason the bathroom doesn't have its own bookcase is because I worry about the damp)My life is so intertwined with books that I honestly cannot see a time where my novels aren't the focal point of every room.Perhaps rereading the book will give me some perspective...All in all - I loved learning her secrets to a tidy life. My kitchen is wholly organized and I'm going to tackle the basement next. There's something truly wonderful about stepping back from a long tidying session and just admiring how nice the house looks!YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads"
10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59329-la-petite-am-ricaine,Rating 1 out of 5,"""Be careful whose advice you buy but be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth."" --Mary Schmich. I'm trying, Mary. I really am. Oh, screw it. This was the most stressful book I've ever read. I haven't been thrown into such a fucking frenzy of hatred since The Book Thief, and as with The Book Thief, I'm astounded that audiences en masse are embracing such codswollop. I'm baffled as to why this is a bestseller. My best guess is that Marie Kondo targeted the most materialistic generation in the history of humanity, and they've since passed the book on to their equally superficial, spiritually empty, and stuff-obsessed grandchildren, who have made the fucking thing go viral. At this point, we should just accept the fact that when our fellow countrymen gobble up 4 million copies of a book, it's garbage. Seriously. Stupid just hit a whole new level.But before I go tearing the book and its semi-literate fans to pieces, let's be fair: I'm not the intended audience. Other than the fact that I'm an unduly harsh critic of everything I read (I like to call that using my brain, but whatever), I already live minimally: I live in one of the rainiest cities in the country, but I will never buy an umbrella; except for 4 absolute favorites, all of my books are in the Cloud; knick-knacks make make me want to smack someone, the mismatched mess of an ""eclectic"" decorating style nauseates me, and I never buy anything unless I need it or love it. My house is almost always immaculate, and I don't do clutter. Excess ""stuff"" stresses me out to no end. As I read Kondo's book, I realized that I'm not the typical American drowning in an excess of useless crap. (Living in Europe and trading continents 4 times in your 20s can do that to a person). So why wasn't I nodding in agreement with her guide to decluttering? You mean it's not obvious? Come on, people! Good God. When Americans' capacity for critical thinking has reached the level of blindly adopting all things Marie Kondo/KonMari, we've got bigger problems than ""too much stuff."" Look. There's no such thing as the ""KonMari method for tidying up."" Her ideas should only strike you as new if you've ignored the folding techniques of every retail store you've ever entered, or you've never poked through a Feng Shui catalog. Saying that you follow the ""KonMari method for tidying up"" is like saying you follow the ""Harpo method for finding your spirit"" or the ""Martha Stewart Omnimedia method"" of crafting Christmas ornaments out of pinecones and pipe cleaners.There  is no KonMari method, you idiots. This isn't some ancient Japanese art of decluttering put forth by one diminutive woman from Tokyo. Marie Kondo was manufactured by a Japanese publishing outlet, and KonMari isn't a method, it's a media company. I'm not bothered by the woman-as-the-face-of-a-media-company thing. It's been done before. (Oprah and Martha Stewart, anyone?) What disgusts me about this book is the deception behind it. I don't dig Oprah, but at least she got people talking about uncomfortable topics like sexual assault and racism, among other things. And at least Martha Stewart was candid about her perfectionism and relentless focus on her business functioning as coping mechanisms during an ugly divorce. But Kondo? This chick is packaging her brand of crazy as the path to joy. I mean, peddling your mental illness as the new normal? Damn, that's cold. Look. If you're an American with an abundance of junk, you're normal. You're fine. Marie Kondo wants you to have a problem with your junk so she can make money. Dealing with her issues doesn't make her rich -- selling you her psychosis does.Do you really believe Kondo found joy in decluttering when she says her cleaning obsession started at age 5, and was a ""custom [she] maintained even after entering high school,"" as she ""sat on the floor for hours sorting things""? If you're going to ignore the fact that Kondo chose cleaning over normal after-school activities--a job, calling boys, playing sports--it's easy to brush aside her mention of having a teenage breakdown because her room wasn't clean enough. (Um, that's not a happy kid). Path to joy indeed. But we don't need to psychoanalyze the early years. Kondo admits that her passion for tidying ""was motivated by a desire for recognition from [her] parents,"" and that she ""had an unusually strong attachment to things"" rather than people. (Hi, sad). But is a childless 20-something/former souvenir salesperson, fresh out of an unhappy childhood, really the one you want leading you down the supposed path to joy? Think about what this chick is saying:""The purpose of a letter is fulfilled the moment it is received. By now, the person who wrote it has long forgotten what he or she wrote and even the letter's very existence."" Jesus. That's a bleak outlook on life. But I guess Kondo is right. My grandma doesn't give a shit about the letters she wrote me--she's dead. Then again, I don't hold on to letters from grandma for her sake. ""Aim for perfection."" Jesus CHRIST. The only thing I hate more than knick-knacks and the eclectic is a living space created with ""perfection"" in mind. ""Perfect"" living spaces are stressful. They're goddamned mausoleums void of character and humanity. There's a little genius in a (small) organized mess. A tad bit of clutter is humanizing. There can be beauty in a bit of chaos. Hey, Marie, here's an idea: get outside more. Perfection is a fleeting organic moment: a newborn baby, a sunset, the Fibonacci sequence in the florets of a flower. It's not some state you declutter your way into. ""Move all of your storage units into your closet. This is where I usually put steel racks, bookcases, and cupboards or shelves, which can also be used to store books."" This. Right here. This is exactly why I found this book so goddamned irritating. Passages like this made my immaculate and clutter-free city apartment feel like it wasn't good enough. Take my bookcase. I hate bookcases. I view them as a way of storing junk, and in my 30-something years, I've only seen one bookcase done well. But I have a bookcase for my 6 year-old. (No goddamn way am I going to put his books on the Cloud, giving him another excuse to stare at a screen). I was never bothered by the bookcase until I read Kondo's book, but now I can't wait until we can throw the damn thing away. And moving it out of sight will magically make me hate it less?Yeah, no. This is my son's house, too. Sorry, Marie, I'm not going let your book make me miserable about a kid's bookcase. I'll go back to not noticing it. Thanks. Never, ever tie up your stockings. Never, ever ball up your socks. God! Who the fuck cares about how they fold their socks? I'd love to scribble all over Kondo's walls just to see what she'd do. ""Transform your closet into your own private space, one that gives you the thrill of pleasure.Heh. An organized closet sparking a ""thrill of pleasure""? I'd recommend another human being or a battery-powered...never mind, get your ""thrill of pleasure"" wherever, it's not my business. ""When you stand in front of a closet that has been reorganized...your heart will beat faster and the cells in your body buzz with energy."" Isn't it weird that Kondo describes an organized closet with words generally associated with falling in love/physical intimacy? Well, that's...fucked up, but whatever. I had an altogether different experience. When I upgraded to a new apartment a few months ago, I organized my hall closet. Afterwards, I stood there wondering if I'd accomplished anything or just wasted a bunch of time. When my 6 year-old wandered up and, near tears said, ""When you clean, we don't get to play,"" I went ahead and decided on the latter. This is the routine I follow every day when I return home from work. First, I unlock the door and announce to my house, 'I'm home!' Picking up the pair of shoes I wore yesterday...I say, 'Thank you very much for you hard work,' and put them away...I put my jacket and dress on a hanger, say 'Good job!'...I put [my handbag] on the top shelf of the closet, saying 'You did well. Have a good rest.'""  Um. She's talking to her stuff. What the f%$#?!?!And why are Americans so quick to dismiss Kondo's talking to inanimate objects as some cultural quirk? No one talks to their shit in Japan unless they're certifiably nuts. ""The best way to choose what to keep and what to throw away is to take each item in one's hand and ask: 'Does this spark joy?'"" LOL, the ""wisdom"" of people under 30. Anyone who has kids (or a general understanding of life) knows this is fucking ridiculous.I mean, give me a break! Going all slash and burn on your life, save for items that ""spark joy?"" I wonder what people who've lost everything in a fire would say about that? I'm sure people who survived major disasters would *totally* enlighten you about the *joy* sparked from their stuff. Obviously, if your mountain of junk makes you miserable, your stuff owns you. But if you Kondo-ize your house until you only have things that ""bring you joy,"" your reduced pile of stuff still owns you.Face it. If you're looking for joy in the material, you don't need Marie Kondo--you need to reevaluate your life. Okay, fine. Maybe I'm being unfair. People are indeed affected by their environment, and decluttering can feel satisfying, even cleansing. But look who's telling you how to go about it: a chick whose childhood obsession with cleaning came from trying to please others, whose sole work experience includes selling junk at shrines, and whose descriptions of ""joy"" include rules, repetition, ritual, and talking to inanimate objects. Yeah. They make medication for that. At this point, I should pick up Marie Kondo's book and ask myself whether it sparks joy. Well, no, it actually sparks rage. To the trash with it, then! SUCKED."

Funniest moments include the author bursting into tears when she discovers a smudge of bathroom slime on the bottom of her shampoo bottle and that she believes if you have 80 rolls of toilet paper in your house, you are a hoarder instead of a Coscto member. This is a woman who has her entire bookshelf in her clothes closet; if I walk into your house and you do not have 200 books laying around that you haven't read yet, I simply don't trust you as a human being.

Not that he ever remembers when he comes back from college.I bet you with all the money the sales of this book engenders that the author will no longer be cleaning and tidying up her house herself but also get a magic Cynthia of her own."
13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/666282-nick,Rating 5 out of 5,"Because I have such admiration for the Japanese aesthetic, I picked up this book with interest. In fact, I was delighted to discover that my lifetime habits of tidying are roughly in line with Marie Kondo's, the expert's, except for a brilliant bit of advice relative to clothes that I can't wait to try. Kondo's basic mantra is ""keep things that bring you joy; discard everything else,"" and that is so cool that I'm going to try it, because it goes further than what I had thought, but along the same lines. My goal is to have a house as clear and clutter-free as a Japanese tea-ceremony room or house. I've got a ways to go, but lots of joy to discover. If you're a pack rat, read this book now, and get started. If you're already on the tidy brigade, this book will help you up your game. Additional thoughts: there is a third category, beyond ""things that bring you joy,"" and ""things that don't,"" and that is ""things that you gotta have but can't really be expected to bring you joy."" I have a couple of garden hoses, hung on a bracket in my garage. They don't bring me joy; they bring me chores, occasionally. But I would be foolish to get rid of them. I wish Kondo had addressed this third category. Much as I delighted in this book, and appreciate its goals, it seems utopian now after wrestling with the ideas in it for a few weeks."

Nu cred că există cineva care să-l conteste. Și, totuși... Marie Kondo sugerează că aruncarea gunoiului, acest obicei banal, presupune o metafizică abisală, de sorginte japoneză. Trebuie să ne pătrundem de filosofia vidului, de înțelepciunea nimicului...Totul e banal (și facil) în acest mult lăudat volum. Ideea principală („Tot ceea ce posezi sfîrșește prin a te poseda”) a fost exprimată cu milenii în urmă de înțelepții greci. Citez din Epicur (secolele IV-III î. Hr.): „Dacă nu te poți mulțumi cu puțin, nu te poți mulțumi cu nimic”. Japonezii păstrează o mînă de lucruri în casă dintr-un motiv mult mai puțin filosofic decît bănuim. Țara e într-o zonă seismică. Iar „experții” au observat că, la un cutremur de 8 pe Richter, nu mori pentru că-ți cade tavanul în cap, ci pentru că vine șifonierul (de mahon) peste tine și te strivește. Minimalismul japonez (odăi aproape goale, tatami, paravane în loc de uși etc.) e pragmatic. Nu trebuie să fii un gînditor profund ca să înțelegi asta. Și să rămîi în viață...Toate recomandările consemnate în acest volum se adresează celor avuți, colecționarilor de fleacuri. Moda Kondo la ei a prins, ei au ridicat-o în slăvi pe autoare, ei au transformat-o într-o vedetă. Un om sărac nu prea are ce să arunce din casă (cînd are o casă). Și nici ce să lase moștenire. El nu posedă un parc de mașini, o vilă cu 3 bucătării și un morman de blănuri. Pentru sărac „depozitarea șosetelor” (pp.72-73) nu poate fi o problemă încîlcită, de vreme ce are, să zicem, doar 3 perechi. Pe prima o poartă luni și miercuri, pe a doua marți și joi, ultima e pentru zilele de vineri și duminică. Sîmbăta nu iese din casă. Respectă sabatul.Ideea de a păstra cît mai puțin e etern valabilă (cu asta sînt perfect de acord), dar mă îndoiesc că „a-ți face ordine în casă aduce noroc” (p.165). Și cei dezordonați pot cîștiga la Loto...În fine, tot ceea ce spune Kondo despre cărți (pp.77-83) mi se pare profund greșit. E observația unui om care nu are obiceiul de a citi. Marie Kondō ne îndeamnă să renunțăm la cărțile pe care le-am străbătut doar parțial. Sau deloc. „Dacă ai citit numai jumătate dintr-o carte, de fapt, atît merita să parcurgi din ea”. Deci, cartea e de vină pentru lenea noastră de a citi. Kondo nu bănuiește că poți păstra o carte în biblliotecă și 5 ani fără să o consulți. Din fericire, interesele și pasiunile noastre se modifică destul de frecvent și cartea odinioară „inutilă” își găsește brusc locul pe masa ta și îți oferă sugestii la care nu te-ai așteptat...P. S. Îmi scapă cu totul motivul pentru care un astfel de product a ajuns bestseller în Occident. Poate pentru că e pe înțelesul tuturor și nu pretinde nici un efort mintal..."

Maybe it was the fact that I had read that book prior to this or the fact that I have been reading a lot of minimalist blogs and sites that already extrapolated the best parts of this book and the KonMari Method...but I just found myself very underwhelmed here. I can definitely appreciate the message and the process here, but listening to her talk about how she was in tears as a 5 year old when she couldn't figure out the best way to organize her closet had me like...

But about a third of the book was spent repeating itself and when it wasn't doing that...it was just weird to me. I wondered at times if the book was satire or a memoir of OCD disguised as the middle child syndrome. Some examples that had me wondering if this was satire or not include:1) She talked as though inanimate objects have feelings or as though they are alive so you have to say goodbye to them and a nice thought before throwing them away. You don't want to hurt their feelings since they no longer bring you joy. She thinks that socks shouldn't be balled up because they deserve to rest comfortably since they are a medium being rubbed between your feet and your shoes. Poor socks.2) When she goes to someone's house to help ""tidy"" (organize) she bows in the middle of the room and greets it and also thanks it for allowing her to tidy it up. Basically she and the room connect at an intimate level before she goes stripping it down to its bareness. Oh, and she wears a dress and blazer when tidying to show respect to the house (not its occupant) and thinks you should too. Sweat pants are a big no-no ladies! And don't forget to clean out your purses on a daily basis. No bloated purses for you.3) She claims that tidying rids the body of toxins and that she sees it quite often. She claims that it clears the skin and trims the waistline. So don't be alarmed if after purging you get a pimple or your belly starts to rumble. She said that after one of her clients tidied up her space she immediately had diarrhea (yes, she went there) as though her body was purging its junk out too.4) Once when she replaced her cell phone, she was sure to send her previous phone a text message thanking it for its service. When she did this, her phone (that always worked properly) died and never worked again. It was like it knew it's job was done.I would have probably taken more from this book if there was less of the above type of examples. Now I just think the book is a bit kooky."

Well, that’s bullshit, obviously. If thntn doesn’t like a book by an author that is of a different race than her’s... I guess that makes thntn a racist herself. It appears that I have to make a correction. I’m told that Ms. Kondo never said to get rid of hangers. I apologize. It must have been the word ‘tidy’ echoing in my brain on a loud enough level that I missed it.Forgive me.Terrible. Ridiculous. Repetitive.If you took the words, tidy, tided, and tidying, out of this book you would be left with a pamphlet. I have this thing called misophonia and I made the crucial error of listening to this book on audio. Repetitive stuff can really get under my skin and there were a few instances when listening to this book that I had to stop myself from throwing my phone out of my moving vehicle. “Say tidy one more time! Do it!” Crunch.This isn’t the type of book I would normally pick up and I think I did because of something a friend mentioned. I’ve been thinking of go through all my stuff and simplifying. So much crap accumulates around a house over the years and it starts to make one feel a little anxious. I thought that maybe this book might have some helpful tips to get it done.Nope.This is the book broken down once all the ‘tidy’ words have been removed.1.	The whole damn house must be done in one go. (Hahahaha)2.	You have to touch each item you own and ask yourself if it brings you joy. (Riiiight)3.	If the item does not bring you joy, thank the item for it’s service (I’m not kidding) and discard it.4.	Don’t ball up your socks or tie your hose together (who does that?) because it hurts their feelings (I’m still not kidding), your supposed to put them together and roll them up like sushi and stand them in shoe boxes. 5.	Fold all your clothing, no hangers of any kind EVER! Because it’s very important to touch everything you own as often as possible….but I have to touch my clothes to hang them, right?6.	Store things vertically. This means, don’t lay your shirts down flat in the drawer, but file them (I guess) like you would files in a file drawer….?.....7.	Women, always choose pretty clothing to wear even while lounging around the house or going bed. (Um, no)Seriously, how much time does this woman have? There was more ridiculousness I’m sure, but I think I blocked it out, or I missed things whilst yelling ‘no no no no’ to block out the ‘tidies’. As a experiment, I started going through my stuff. I didn’t ask the stuff any questions. I worked diligently, though I took breaks here and there, and after two days of sorting, purging, loading up the car and running the stuff to be donated, I got trough….drum roll please….. One. Closet.Don’t bother with this book unless you love the words, tidy, tidied, and tidying and you need a good laugh."

Después de leer un blog, que no sé si conocéis (se llama Orden y Limpieza) entendí todo un poco mejor. La autora del blog se llama Alicia, es una mujer española experta en organización (ordenar casas, ayudar en mudanzas, rutinas...). En una entrada, habló de los fallos que ella ve al método de Marie. Para empezar, hay una diferencia de base cultural. Eso es así. Marie es japonesa, la gran mayoría de sus clientes también lo son, y las diferencias culturales están ahí. La vida mediterránea es muy distinta a la vida japonesa. En otro punto trata el tema de ordenar del tirón vs ordenar poco a poco y comenta el temido efecto rebote, que fue justamente lo que me pasó a mí. Me pegué la panzada a tirar, organizar, en muy poco tiempo y al poco el piso estaba más desordenado que nunca. He cambiado el método, y me he hecho un horario de organización y limpieza para ir desglosándolas en varios días. Así me siento muuuucho mejor, más tranquila y el piso está perfecto. De hecho, es lo que hacía antes.Concluye su post explicando que cada uno debe organizarse en base a su vida.

One category down, a whole house to go. It's so fun to get dressed now; all I have to do is reach in and anything I pull out ""sparks joy"" in my heart. After going up three sizes and then back down again within the last 2 years, you'd think I wouldn't have anything left to discard, but that wasn't true. So many items were hiding the good stuff, dragging me down with bad memories, worn out associations, and/or poor lines and fit.After reading a few chapters, my husband has already begun with his own clothes, and miracle of miracles, he immediately bought some new work pants in his own style, of his own choosing, the kind that ""spark joy"" for him. And this man hates to shop. So, life-changing? Yes! Does the book coincide with everything I've learned in the last 40 years of studying the energetic nature of human beings and all life as we know it? Yes! Do I love this book? Yes! Am I the kind of person who, even though I recently undertook another de-cluttering project, still lived amid stashes of things that weighed me down with guilt and obligation and insecurity? Yes! My husband and I experienced some scary poverty years early in our lives together. It's been difficult ever since to resist the urge to keep more than we need. As the youngest in our respective families, we also shared the habit of accepting whatever was given to us, hand-me-downs that might or might not have suited us. The concept of wearing, using, or keeping only items that ""spark joy"" makes brilliant sense to me now, and feels like wonderful liberation.I am very excited and inspired by Marie Kondo's work, and I'm equally enthusiastic about continuing throughout the house until we are living a much smaller, less encumbered, joyously infused material existence here in our happy home. I love the way she characterizes the impact of our thoughts on our things, and vice versa. I just love her entire outlook. Oh yes, one more life-changing aspect (already): I hated to fold things. Just like she says, after following her instructions (and watching her demonstrate on YouTube) it's become a fun game for me. Weird, but true. You have to experience this to believe it. I recommend reading the entire book before you begin any ""tidying-up,"" though, so you get the full effect of Marie Kondo’s charismatic, inspirational advice."

That is really the essence of Kondo's advice, but she has more to offer in the rest of the book too, and it's surprisingly eccentric and Japanese. No American book would advise praying to your house before tidying it, for example, or suggest that objects just want to help you and that, once released from your possession, they will continue reflecting their helpful energy back to you from wherever they are.It seems that these suggestions make Kondo unusual even in Japan, but her Shinto-influenced outlook is so much like what my mother raised me with that it was exactly what I needed to work through the guilt that keeps me clinging to objects I don't use or even particularly like. Because she spoke my language, I decided to take her suggestions literally, even the odd ones. So I lit some incense, clapped a couple of times, and prayed to my apartment.

21,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,No Rating,"I got hooked on watching a show from around ten years ago called Hoarders. As you may imagine from the title, this is about people who are the polar opposite of tidy. If you, dear Goodreader, exploded a bomb inside your house, the resulting vista of destruction would still be 100% more organised than these hoarders. I realised that I myself hoard books. But very neatly. Most of them are in the loft. The first section is fiction, arranged, obviously, by author’s last name. I’ve read all these. I am thinking that Marie Kondo might possibly give me a hard time about that. She could reasonably ask why I need to keep those, since there is no possibility I could ever have the time to reread any of them, and in any case, I rated quite a few of them one or two stars, so why would I ever want to. This is where me and the hoarders are not so far apart. They keep stuff they won’t ever use, they seem to imagine vaguely that they will be able to live another hundred years and be able to get round to all these projects and sort out all these towering piles of broken furniture and rain damaged guitars and patch all those rat-gnawed doileys. In the fiction section those names beginning with Mc give me mild anxiety – should I assume there is an A between the M and the c? If I don’t those authors will find themselves exiled from their clan members whose names begin Mac. So I assume, but trepidaciously. The short story collections come at the end of the fiction section. There is no sensible way of ordering them. Very sorry but no one remembers who edits an anthology so their names are useless. After fiction comes Memoirs, Politics, Theology and History. These have their own idiosyncrasies which I shan’t bore you with. After those comes some great shelves of graphic novels and then science fiction followed by my Shelf of Shame : true crime. I’m sure Ray Bradbury shudders to find himself within arm’s reach of John Wayne Gacy (whereas Kurt Vonnegut smiles sardonically) but I am not running Borges’ Library of Babel here. So that is the loft. Downstairs you will find bookcases dedicated to biographies (arranged alphabetically by subject name not by author name), books about books, and books about music. There are memoirs and biographies in the music book section – I know! What a contradiction! Shouldn’t the music biographies be shelved with all the other biographies? Should Joni Mitchell come between Grace Metalious and Anais Nin? How delicious!. Should Captain Beefheart interpose himself between Samuel Beckett and Saul Bellow? Perish the thought. So after much head scratching I assigned the musicians to their own ghetto. Then finally I have some shelves dedicated to those most intimidating books of all – the To Be Reads. They glower at me every day. I know what they are thinking – why haven’t you read me yet? Eight years I have been patiently waiting! Am I no longer pretty enough? Some of the older ones watch newer arrivals plucked off the tbr shelf almost immediately – I can hear their pages gnashing. I’m almost sure Marie Kondo would tell me point blank to get rid of half of these books. So I’ll put my copy of The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up carefully on my tbr shelf and benignly ignore it for a few years."

I know a secret. If you have too much stuff and it’s bugging you then get rid of it. All of it. Well, nearly all of it. Save a few things but only the things you absolutely love, the things that spark joy within your being (you’ll know it when you feel it, says the author) and don’t bring more things into the house unless you love and/or need them. Don’t think you can do that? Well, never mind then.This author wants you to be absolutely ruthless with your possessions and do it in one fell swoop. Don’t dilly-dally and put certain unpleasant things off. Absolutely do not waste money buying “storage solutions”. Just get rid of your stuff and you won’t have to store it or dust it or leave it there to feel bad for itself. Now, none of this is a bad thing (though the last might be a wee bit kooky) and honestly I’m all for it. I had way too much crap lying about and it was driving me crazy. Broken crap, ugly crap, gifted crap, crap that had been there so long it was invisible to me. But this book has a problem and it is a BIG one that I’m betting many of you here on this site may take issue with as well. 

Step #2, you see, is books. BOOKS! Step freaking two is BOOKS. As you can probably easily imagine, I am stuck here on step #2 because, well, it’s a call to action to rid myself of my precious books! I’ve been collecting books since I was twelve years old. I have a lot of books but I’m afraid I may love them all. #1 was clothes, shoes, accessories and that was a breeze. Who needs clothes taking up space that could hold a few books? This was easy, thought I. My closet was done in an hour or so. Everything culled, sorted and color coded and folded all nice and tidy-like. I could blow through this, thought I. A zen and clutter-free life was within my grasp. I had this. Then step #2 happened and I was instructed to rid myself of all of the books I have loved before (but may not love again) and all of the books I have not read yet. Uh oh. I was told to remove my TBR pile(s) from my life. Forever. And almost always. She’ll allow you to re-buy digitally if you are pining away and dying of sadness for it. I was instructed to touch each one and see if it sparked that apparently not-so-elusive feeling of joy within me. Trouble is they all kind of did. I suppose I am broken. I tried folks, I truly did. I took pictures and even posted them online in an attempt to humiliate myself into following through. I even went so far as removing a gigantor bookshelf, stocked three piles deep, floor-to-ceiling, from my room as well as an armoire I no longer needed. I have to admit my room looks and feels calms and free and spacious. The bookshelf now neatly resides in my basement. I pulled off all of the books and starting sorting them but it made me incredibly sad to think about tossing them out of my house where they might potentially end up in a trash/recycle bin (according to the author everything has feelings so how could I allow this? Better they be a little lonesome on my shelf than DEAD, right?!). Instead of tossing them into bags, I started arranging them by color (which she wants you to do with clothes) and then I put all but a dozen or so back up on the shelves. They look happy and pretty and they brighten the back wall of the basement. I have decided that I am keeping them. They are my one and only vice and I work hard. They are not clutter.I think I shall pretend that step 2 was nothing but a fever dream.After I was revived with sniffing salts I got back to business. So next comes all of the other stuff which I can easily part ways with; the paper, the stuff no one ever eats, the gadgets (my days of bread baking are over), the broken things that we’ve been thinking we’ll fix someday, the mementos, pictures and all the other useless crapola that has been residing in the basement since we moved in a million years ago. I’ve removed countless bags of trash and several car loads of “stuff” and hauled them to Goodwill and I miss none of it. It is so much easier to clean my house now. I haven’t followed this plan as written, it’s difficult when you live with several other people, so we still have some bins and crud to get to but now I'm inspired to keep at it.This book will give you some unique tools and I do recommend it if you skip step two or perhaps save it for last, if you’re anything like me. She has a nifty way of folding clothes that helped me fit everything into a few drawers and will keep me in check if I decide I need more yoga pants. You really do see just how much of each clothing category you own when you pile them all on the bed/floor and separate them into their own little categories. She doesn’t declutter by room but by category. This stops you from getting stuck (on pictures or mementos which are left for the end) and forces you to deal with an entire category and actually finish the job so you never have to do it again. She also tells you to start with a clear vision of your end result. That bit of advice has helped me tremendously.The author clearly has an obsession with tidying. She does not deny this. Apparently, she’s been this way since she was a wee, strange child and goes into great detail at the beginning of book about her childhood hobby of “tidying”. This makes the start a bit of a slog. I found some of her beliefs a little quirky and I will not be emptying my bag out each night so my stuff can “breathe” only to put everything back in come morning (what the?!) but if you can overlook some of the odd things she says, you’ll more than likely find something here to help you out.

If you use the words ""spark joy"", ""feel happiness"" and ""reduce anxiety"" enough times, people will want to follow your lead and pay you good money for your advice. and on a practical level I've learnt that 1. you can apply origami skills to any item of clothing (it may take years to master the art of folding your stockings, but apparently it will save you lots of time in the long run) 2. you ought to store everything vertically, whether that's knickers, pencils or a waffle iron (but only if that waffle iron *sparks joy* in you, obviously). 3. the ideal situation is to live in a bare, sterile home, and should anyone dare to give you an ornament or any other tangible gift, discard it at the earliest opportunity by saying ""thank you, object X, for teaching me that I'm better off without you"". 4. ""reading clouds your judgment"". and for future reference: You thought there was no space in Switzerland? Well, don't ever think about moving to Japan, unless you are ready to throw out everything you have, and that probably includes your children.

Instead of focusing on categories, fiddly buckets, or accessories from Bed Bath and Beyond, Marie Kondo asks us to reevaluate the way we relate to our homes and belongings. The question, ""does this spark joy?"" seems pat, but it truly liberates you to think critically why you keep something around. By the end of the book, you'll understand that we keep things that don't enhance our current lives because we are not fully living in the present - that we cannot let go of the past, or are not yet ready to make room for something new in our future.

Doubtless the Kat had an ulterior motive (the office is a stacked up mess) but this book offers more than tips on tidying.The author, Marie Kondo, has made tidying up her life since she was a small child, and shares many anecdotes about her early days as a stealth clutter-control operative in her family home, as well as some of the false starts she had on her way to her tidying method.

If one has the will, the method works, and she is also right that I have no desire to go back to my old ways in that kitchen. I think I will apply this method to my clothing and office.Books and papers? well, I may need to build up to that!"
28,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14457130-whitney-atkinson,Rating 4 out of 5,"I picked up this book because so many people talk about it, but I'm not necessarily a hoarder or someone who has too many things that I need to tidy up. This was only four hours long on audiobook so I flew through it in two sittings (while cleaning my room, coincidentally). And although I don't agree with Marie a ton about thinning down on your things (ie. for sentimental items, she's like ""throw them away!! it had value to you once and now it's gone!!"" like, no. im keeping everything i've touched until i die lol), I do think a lot of her advice is helpful. Some testimonies about weight loss and having people's life turn around after tidying seemed a liiiittle far fetched, but still, if this method helped some people get in a good headspace, I'm not discounting that.The thing I didn't expect from this book and I think is really valuable is the discussion about appreciating your things. This isn't a book about tidying so much as a book about only keeping the things that matter to you. America is such a materialistic society and this book is a good reminder to be nice to the things you own and to find value in everything, otherwise it isn't worth keeping. I don't think i'll be saying to my clothes, ""thank you for keeping me warm"" like Marie does, but it was a nice nudge to recognize that owning a lot of things is a privilege, and you can pass on any stuff that has already fulfilled its purpose in your life."

Most methods advocate a room-by-room or little-by-little approach, which doom you to pick away at your piles of stuff forever. The Mari Method, with its revolutionary category-by-category system, leads to lasting results. In fact, none of Kondo's clients have lapsed (and she still has a three-month waiting list).

31,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2744708-jess-the-shelf-declared-bibliophile,Rating 3 out of 5,"When I first started this book, it felt absolutely life changing. I was already facing a looming ""fall cleaning"", as I had family coming to visit and I usually do a deep house cleaning before the holiday decorating starts anyway. After a couple of chapters, I immediately spent a couple of days going through just about everything in the house and loaded up around 5 trashbags to be donated, as well as 2 large boxfuls of books, and that's not even counting all I threw away (which was also a lot!). I inadvertently even influenced my girlfriend to fill a couple of trashbags with clothes to be donated, and that's saying much for someone who HATES going through clothes. I feel this book definitely helped my aspect on how to treat my possessions and home, and gave me a plethora of ways I can work on improving both. I don't buy in to ALL of her methods, like throwing every piece of clothing in the middle of a room and feeling them one by one to see which sparks joy. That would take me a month! Same with all my books! However, I definitely have taken a lot from this, and I would recommend it to anyone. It lost some stars as I trucked through to the end as it started to feel a bit repetitive and even silly at times, like speaking to my possessions and home and giving thanks to them every day. I definitely believe in positive energy but not necessarily actually communicating with inanimate objects. Overall, worth the read, but some of it perhaps take with a grain of salt. "

Te dicta 1. Por qué cambiar tu estilo de vida, 2. Cómo hacerlo y 3. Lo que esto te traerá. Lo más importante de esto siendo el punto 2; pone todo lo que ha aprendido a tu alcance, con soluciones rápidas y baratas o, como en la mayor parte de las ocasiones, gratis.En lo personal veo fallas en el método KonMari, pero le estoy aprendiendo cosas muy valiosas como el respeto y agradecimiento hacia los objetos que nos rodean al igual que entender que no necesitamos muchas de las cosas que tenemos, en especial si las conservamos por compromiso o valores sentimentales."

35,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90786-lee-klein,Rating 4 out of 5,"Interesting if read as the autobiography of a tidy-mongering obsessive. Like all those Netflix documentaries, obsession is the key ingredient to greatness. Jacks of all trades don't write books like these and don't have documentaries made about them. As a practical guide, I sort of can't wait to return home from extended thanksgiving week in-law exposure in the Midwest and implement these ideas. My wife and I have agreed to compete to see who can discard and order more of our stuff. I'll win because I have less stuff and it's basically already in order, but I'm looking forward to reducing my load, particularly clothes that don't ""spark joy."" The author is a little nutso, which makes this more interesting than it might be -- there's a spiritual self-help evangelical angle that's always appealing. I hope our eyes gleam once all our crap clicks into place. I realize that I already employ a lot of these ideas, especially where I'm employed -- how I organize my electronic files. Everything is clearly organized so I never worry about where things are or where they go. I never search for a file -- I click right to it via shortcuts on my desktop for current projects arranged like a remote control. Once I organized things about two years ago I've never had to organize again. But at home, the storage rack and rod in my closet recently collapsed from the weight of my crap. Too much crap hung up, heavy coats etc. My destroyed closet was on my mind a lot as I read -- also read this at my wife's parents' place, which tempted me at every turn to implement these ideas. I straightened some areas in the living room but didn't dare discard. Also, although this book doesn't do it, it's interesting to think about the difficulty of expanding these ideas to society as a whole. It could only be done by a dictator or fascist government. Or maybe once everyone read the book and adopted the method, everything would be tidier as a result. But who really wants a tidy city? I come up against this whenever I sweep the sidewalk outside of our place -- but that's a story I'll link to if the essay I wrote about getting fined $50 for sweeping my block is ever published."

37,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4795451-tamara-taylor,Rating 1 out of 5,"What in the ever-loving-bananas did I just read?I actually needed to take a day to calm down before I wrote this review so it wouldn't come off as too scathing.Firstly, I should have known better than to read something with the words ""life-changing"", ""magic"" and ""tidying"" in the title. I kind of deserve it. No good can come of any such combo!!In an effort to be positive and kind, here is what I liked about the book:-You should keep things you like-Everything should have its own place-We all have too much ""stuff""-Take care of your personal belongings-You don't have to feel compelled to keep things that people gave to you (ie. I have some gifts that perhaps I should feel sentimental about but I don't, and I've been hanging on to them for years)-Getting your environment in order can help you relax at home and get the rest of your life more organizedThe bad:-I don't feel actual ""joy"" about too many things that aren't living. I think the use of the word ""joy"" in this scenario is misguided.-Books: I will forever and always be a proud book hoarder. There are books that elicit profound sorrow, and yet I feel they are important and necessary. And I was horrified to read that she would tear pages out of books to avoid keeping whole books. The horror!! If ANYTHING in your house deserves to be treated like a friend, its your books!-Ain't nobody got time to completely unpack their handbag each evening and put the contents into yet another designated space.-The anthropomorphizing that goes on in this book is disturbing. -Getting on your knees to worship and communicate with your house is disturbing.-A lot of this book was disturbing to the point where I was questioning if there was an underlying mental illness. It was uncomfortable. I felt like this gal needs some help, not to be world famous.Assumptions I made about the author:-She has never lived with a man or children. Tidying up in this situation truly requires ""magic""...more of the pharmaceutical kind.-An air of condescension and pride in ""knowing the very best way"" really put me off.-I felt very sad for her. She came across as very emotionally young. Her retrospective commentary on the ineptitude of her family members and schoolmates came across as the rantings of a 14 year old girl.-Her passion is clearly tidying and she's dedicated her entire life to it. She spoke of spending 90% of her time thinking about tidying. It appears that her life revolves around the material items in life. I wish she'd get a pet or a hobby other than obsessing over socks, talking to her jacket and petting her houseplant.All in all this book left me feeling icky inside instead of inspired. I admit I was curious about the Kondomari method and googled some interesting articles on her folding methods which I had employed several weeks ago. I wish I'd left it at that and not delved deeper into the madness.Conclusion: Be kind. Laugh a lot. Wear sweatpants if you damn well please. Keep the old love letters. Grow old in a fortress of books. I'd rather be a happy slob anyday."

39,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7425446-julie,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book had a magical effect on me alright, although not quite the magic the author had intended. The issue I had with this book was that I did not enjoy reading it. Every time I picked it up all I could think about was how I would much rather be tidying up than reading about tidying up, so I would put it down, making for a very lengthy read of a very short (and repetitive) book. However, something 
sparked
 a change in me as a result of reading this book. I have become obsessed with throwing things out! I cannot profess that her specific method changed me because I found much of her advice impractical for me. She has some interesting ideas if you have the time or lifestyle. I did take the one--and in my opinion only--piece of advice I needed from this book, which was to ask myself before discarding something whether it “brings me joy”. All I can say is it struck a chord in me. Since finishing this book two weeks ago (that took three weeks to read) I’ve discarded/donated/recycled more JUNK that was tidily tucked away and had become out of sight, out of mind. In a short time I’m a changed person and it’s a freeing feeling. So lo and behold there was some magic in this book after all, and for that it was worth the read. That, and I found it mildly entertaining if not comical. At the very least it was thought provoking, but felt more like a chore when I would have rather been reading for pleasure. Recommended if you need a little de-cluttering inspiration, but I might have preferred the audiobook so I could have killed two birds with one stone and saved some precious reading time. :) 3 stars because it motivated me."
40,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15499043-rowizyx,Rating 2 out of 5,"Cara signora Kondo,secondo me hai bisogno di aiuto. Te lo dico serenamente, la tua compulsione non è migliore della mia. Perché leggendo il tuo libro ho avvertito un modus un po' da setta, e sinceramente se devo scegliere tra invasata che ci riesce davvero e piazzista che mi deve convincere a credere in lei (e, se abitassi in Giappone, a prenotarmi per le sue lezioni pagando fior di soldi), forse preferisco l'invasata.Non fraintendermi, ci sono dei suggerimenti che ho intenzione di provare a mettere in pratica. Tipo la disposizione delle magliette nei cassetti, perché potrebbe essere anche risolutivo dal classico ""pescare"" le solite due o tre in cima alla pila, specie io che ho un sacco di magliette con diverse applicazioni e cosine particolari che quindi meriterebbero di fare più a giro per non essere usate troppo e rischiare di rovinarsi prima del tempo. E ieri pomeriggio, mentre aspettavo il caffè, ho fatto due sacchi di spazzatura, e ho eliminato borse ormai rotte e irrecuperabili che ho sfondato... E sì, le ho ringraziate perché sono state mie compagne in un sacco di avventure belle e brutte e mi è dispiaciuto davvero tanto buttarle. Però... Però. L'idea che il tuo brillante metodo preveda di ""buttare via"" e basta mi lascia veramente basita. È per liberarsi di tutto in una giornata e non avere ripensamenti? Lo capisco, però mi sembra comunque stupido: i vestiti, se non sono in condizioni pietose o da ridurre in stracci, si possono donare in beneficenza (che poi sì, se si mettono nello staccapanni qui in sostanza si ""buttano""... anzi, è richiesto di infilare tutto in sacchi chiusi e non trasparenti in modo da disincentivare chi prova a rimanere incastrato per ripescare qualcosa. Ce l'avete lo staccapanni in Giappone, signora Kondo?), o appunto, si possono ridurre in stracci. Noi forse siamo ancora legati ai modi di mia nonna, che ha fatto la guerra ed era abituata a recuperare tutto il recuperabile, e la biancheria vecchia o le lenzuola lise si sono sempre ridotte a stracci da utilizzare per le pulizie. L'idea di buttare i libri mi fa ribrezzo, te lo dico sinceramente: prima di arrivare a questo passo, io tento almeno tre strade. Posso donarli alla biblioteca civica, che ha sempre meno fondi per nuove acquisizioni, posso provare a rivenderli a qualche negozio dell'usato (e recuperare qualche soldino), posso decidere di utilizzarli per bookcrossing o scambi (come il fantastico Pozzo di Natale su Goodreads Italia, ultimi giorni per iscriversi, venite a trovarci!). È vero che, mi dirai tu, nel terzo caso scambio un libro con un altro, quindi per la questione dello svuotare casa dalle cose inutili è nonsense, ma l'idea che tu possa buttare dei libri che ti hanno dato delle emozioni ma non così forti proprio mi fa piangere: proprio perché ti ha dato delle emozioni, non avverti il desiderio di fare in modo che anche altri possano provare quelle emozioni, o magari anche più forti? Non ti farebbe sentire bene condividere quella gioia di cui tu parli, invece che fare un sacco di libri da svuotare nel bidone della carta (perché fai la differenziata, vero?), facendo sostanzialmente morire quei libri? Poi non parliamo del tuo momento ""strappavo le pagine con le citazioni che amavo per conservarle e buttavo via il libro mutilato"", che mi ha fatto venire voglia di prenderti a schiaffoni. In generale... Proprio tu che parli degli oggetti che reagiscono alle sensazioni umane, che sono quasi simbionti a noi, perché pensi che un oggetto debba essere ""terminato"" quando la nostra strada con loro è finita, se in realtà hanno ancora qualcosa da dire o, meglio, da dare? Non so, non conosco abbastanza bene lo shintoismo a cui dici di ispirarti, c'è qualche idea che cozza con l'utilizzare oggetti appartenuti prima a qualcun altro, a sconosciuti che non sappiamo come hanno potuto influenzare? Comunque, ti ringrazio perché con le storie che hai raccontato mi hai fatto sentire una persona molto più normale. Coi tuoi clienti (un po' pazzi anche loro, diciamolo), che non mettono via e non piegano i vestiti perché troppo sbatti, che impilano libri e manga sul pavimento fino a non poterci camminare in mezzo, che mettono TUTTI i loro capi e accessori gli attaccapanni perché così si fa prima a mettere via e non si rendono conto da soli che così usano lo spazio alla cazzo di cane, quelli che mandano tutto ciò che dovrebbero buttare a casa dei genitori tanto che i loro vecchi tra un po' devono andare in albergo perché non c'è più posto per loro. Io ogni tanto scherzo che vado alla ricerca del pavimento perduto in camera mia, perché sono sciatta, semino borse e vestiti un po' messi ma ancora non da lavare, libri di tante biblioteche diverse che a volte sono impilati accanto al letto, ma solo perché il microcomodino che ho in dotazione è piccolo, però oddio, non sono neanche lontanamente malmessa come i soggetti che aiuti tu.Certo, possiamo andare oltre l'idea trita, ritrita e stratrita che una donna che in casa sta in tuta è una donna che non si ama e non si cura? Ho letto le tue considerazioni sul male di indossare la felpa sui pantaloni della tuta... Con indosso una felpa e i pantaloni della tuta. E i calzerotti antiscivolo, aggiungo. Fa freddo, sono casalinga, non verrà nessuno a trovarmi, le altre persone in casa sono anche loro in tuta. Dov'è il dramma? Tu mi dici che si può essere comode e femminili indossando vestiti e sottogonne (ma tu vivi negli anni '50? Vorresti?), perché in tuta una donna non è femminile. Io dunque mi ritengo fortunata perché ho un uomo che mi guarda e non vede i vestiti che mi metto, vede me. A volte è un po' frustrante perché magari io mi compro cose carine che penso gli piaceranno e lui non ci fa caso, tanto l'importante è che i vestiti spariscano il più in fretta possibile... Se essere femminili è portare la gonna, allora io non lo sono assolutamente, eppure ti assicuro che coi miei pantaloni so di essere molto più sensuale di molte donne che affidano agli abiti il compito di farle sembrare sexy, spesso con risultati tragicomici. Ci sono aspetti della mia vita che proverò a migliorare. Per carità. Ma secondo me tu sei una pazza."

AMAZING. and i'm slowly applying her thought process and techniques to many of my belongings. i can only hope to get to the point where i will never have to tidy again, which she states over and over in the book. i love the thought of living in a home of items that bring me joy. a statement that really stuck with me:the question of what you want to own is actually the question of how you want to live your life. attachment to the past and fears concerning the future not only govern the way you select the things you own but also represent the criteria by which you make choices in every aspect of your life, including your relationships with people and your job.

43,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,Rating 3 out of 5,"All gurus are a little mad, and Marie Kondo is no exception. She has been obsessed with tidiness and decluttering ever since she was a child. She may not have much in her home, but what she does have she loves and treasures with a vengeance. I think her attitude towards household objects is definitely fetishistic. 
""Never, ever ball your socks. I pointed to the balled-up socks. 'Look at them carefully. This should be a time for them to rest. Do you really think they can get any rest like that?'That's right. The socks and tights stored in your drawer are essentially on holiday. They take a brutal beating in their daily work, trapped between your foot and your shoe, enduring pressure and friction to protect your precious feet. The time they spend in your drawer is their only chance to rest. But if they are folded over, balled up or tied, they are always in a state of tension, their fabric stretched and their elastic pulled. The roll about and bump into each other every time the drawer is opened and closed......... If you've folded back the tops, start by unfolding them. Place one sock on top of the other and follow the same principles as those for folding clothing. For low-cut socks just cover the feet, folding twice is enough: for ankle socks, three times, for knee socks and over-knee socks, four to six times. You can adjust the number of folds to achieve the height that best suits the drawer. It's easy. Just aim to make a simple rectangle, the key to folding. Store the socks on edge....You'll be amazed how little space you need compared to your 'potato ball days', and you'll notice your socks breathing a sigh of relief at being untied."" 
I ordered this book from the library three months ago, and it only became available a few days ago. In the interim I had my bathroom renovated, and this inspired me to have a general decluttering and tidying up exercise of mammoth proportions. It has therefore been a back-to-front experience. I ordered a tidying up book, it didn't come for months, and in the interim I have ended up doing my own thing.So, all I can do is compare notes... Her experience versus my experience. In the event we approached a lot things quite differently  eg my socks are all still rolled up into balls, but in her book she says one great truth which I would wholly endorse. Decluttering and organising really does make your environment feel wonderfully free and airy. I live in a small house (one friend calls it 'the dolls house'), and it has improved my life massively - I really feel like a weight has been taken off my shoulders, and the rooms all feel so much bigger. I'm absolutely delighted I made the time to do it.I shall include my usual spoiler of notes, but this time I am going to review the author's advice in the light of my own recent experiences.
*THE BOTTOM LINE (Here I agree with MK)You need to get rid of stuff, to create more space. Sometimes it is going to be painful, but if your environment is too full - the bottom line is you have got to chuck stuff. It is no use tidying and organising, if you haven't first chucked everything you no longer use. Use it or lose it.*WHEN I SAY CHUCK, I MEAN RECYCLE (Me)I took most of my stuff to charity shops. If in doubt about something, just ring them first. Putting unwanted stuff into landfill is a (shameful) last resort.* HAVE A SET PERIOD FOR THIS PROJECT (MK, and here I agree with her.)Give yourself a few months to do a big clear out, and make doing that a priority.*MAKE A LIST OF WHAT NEEDS SORTING (Me)This gives you much more control. When you have an hour or so to spare, you can tackle something on the list.*CREATE A DESIGNATED SPACE FOR EVERYTHING (MK and me agree)The practice of that old adage ""a place for everything and everything in its place"" creates tidiness, and thus a tranquil environment.*WHEN YOU ARE SORTING OUT AN AREA, PUT EVERYTHING ON THE FLOOR (MK) No, No, No (Me)MK says take everything out of cupboards and off shelves, put them on the floor. The first thing you need to do is CHUCK, and having everything on the floor helps the chucking process. She particularly suggests this in relation to books! Aggggh! I think this is the path to insanity, especially for Goodreads types, with hundreds of books. I managed to get rid of things very easily straight from their shelves.*START GETTING RID OF THE EASY THINGS FIRST, AND WORK UP TO THE HARDER CATEGORIES (MK)I agree (Me)This is sensible. De-cluttering the cleaning cupboard is always going to be easier than tackling your collection of ancient teddy bears, but once you have got into the swing of decluttering, and the joy of having less is singing in your veins, it is easier to let go of high-nostalgia things too.*BUT KEEP YOUR PASSION (Me)Whilst letting go of tons of stuff, I think you still need to keep hold of your grand passion. For instance I held on to everything to do with my painting and drawing. Even though I have too much painting stuff - I am still keeping it all. I shall work my way through it. It is part of my psyche. I'd rather chop off a leg than get rid of some of my coloured pencils. And by my reckoning that is fine too. The nice thing is with all the decluttering I did, I now have space to put it all tidily away in drawers.*STORE EVERYTHING OF THE SAME TYPE TOGETHER (MK) Why? (Me)Because my house is tiny, I keep a ""Finding"" file on my computer, telling me where I have put things, especially things I only rarely use, but still need. I sequester all sort of odd things away in odd places. When I want something I check my Finding file to see where I have put it. The system works well.*GENERALLY THOUGH, KEEP THINGS WHERE YOU USE THEM (Me)As you empty the shelves and cupboards in your house, it's very tempting to put things in the space just because they fit, rather than because they will be convenient to use when placed there. But everything is best kept near to where you will use it (unless you only use it once or twice a year.)*DON'T JUST INCREASE/ORGANISE STORAGE SPACE. THIS CAN EASILY JUST LEAD TO ADDED CLUTTER (MK)  I disagree (Me)Some of the best things I did in my re-organisation was to create a proper airing cupboard plus two more small cupboards. In fact I now open the airing cupboard at least once a day, just to admire the beautifully stacked and tidy laundry. It's a massive improvement on the squashed laundry hell hole that was there before. Reorganising my cupboards and drawers has also created a positive revolution in the house. Good cupboards are fab. Organised storage spaces are fab.*FANCY STORAGE IS UNNECESSARY. SHOEBOXES ARE BEST. THEY ARE GOOD FOR SO MANY STORAGE PROBLEMS. (MK and me agree)*GET RID OF STOCKPILES (MK)I agree (Me)She says she has had clients with 60 toothbrushes, 30 boxes of clingfilm and 100 boxes of cottonbuds. So okay, of course this isn't you. But have you got some sort of stockpiles? My stockpile was fabrics. We need to get rid of our stockpiles. *LADIES, EMPTY YOUR HANDBAG EVERY NIGHT WHEN YOU GET HOME, AND PUT EVERYTHING AWAY. (MK)No, No, No (Me)This is obviously utter madness.*GET RID OF PAPER FILING (MK & Me)MK is ruthless about this, me less so. But I have been going through my files and I've done tons of chucking and shredding. I do it while watching television so that I don't die of boredom. It is very satisfying putting the much slimmer files back in the drawer, & my filing has shrunk considerably.*GET RID OF THINGS THAT NO LONGER SPARK JOY (MK) No, just be logical, and get rid of things you don't use. (Me.)My red boots spark joy, but I never ever wear them - gotta go.My painting tee shirts are splattered with paint and cause no joy - but they are useful and have to stay.I find a lot of this in my life. I have lots of things that are boring, tatty and ugly....but utterly invaluable. They don't spark joy but they earn their keep.*INSPIRE YOURSELF (Me)The revamp of my bathroom was the thing that galvanized me into overhauling the rest of the house. You could do it just by painting or de-cluttering one room. Something that will give you a sense of how lovely it is to live with less stuff and more space. But you need to take that first step, and get just one room sorted. The rest will follow. 
And the downside of all this minimalist bliss? I am much fussier about tidiness and cleanliness. A speck of toothpaste hits the bathroom mirror? I immediately have to down tools and clean it off. I see some flecks of fluff on the carpet? I immediately have to get a small broom and clear them up. I am hoping I will be less obsessive as time goes on. Fussing around dust motes is a complete waste of time and energy. On the other hand my house is much emptier and tidier. It has taken on a whole new lease of life, and it's giving me a lot of pleasure."

To sum it up, I felt this could have been a better article than book. It was repetitive without a lot of real instruction. I love the idea of it but there will never be a time that I dry my dishes on the deck or dry off shampoo bottles to place them in a cabinet. Similarly, I don't see myself ever feeling joyful about my underwear. Or speaking to my underwear. Or thanking my underwear. Or squeezing everything I own into the tiny closet in my circa 1715 home (yes, that is just closet, not plural). I question how helpful this book would be to a household with small children, or to any household for that matter. There were takeaways but for me, very few. "
45,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/921073-jonathan,Rating 3 out of 5,"Like just about everybody, I have too much shit in my house. I saw this book and decided to read it to see if it could help me rectify that situation.I found her method to be fairly ruthless, but also efficient. She wants you to start with your clothes by taking every article of clothing that you own, dump it onto the floor in a huge pile, and then start throwing things away. Her criteria for whether or not you keep something is to hold it in your hand and decide whether or not it ""sparks joy."" This is basically her determining factor for everything you own. After you've tossed your clothes, move on to your books, trinkets, mementos, etc.I could see this method working for many people, but not all. I feel like I could get rid of plenty of useless garbage, but things like books and records I would have a harder time discarding. It is her business to come to people's houses and walk them through the process. I feel that if I had someone lording over me while I sifted through my earthly possessions I might be more inclined to toss things, but it is much harder to self-regulate. Maybe someday I will read that copy of Gravity's Rainbow. What if I get snowed in for a month and have nothing to do except listen to Peter Frampton on vinyl and read my Norton Anthology of English Literature? I can't just throw those things away, right?Mostly where the author loses me is when she advocates talking to your inanimate objects as if they could hear you. Talking to your house every day for instance, can cause your house to respond with positive energy. Talking to your clothes will make you and them happy. Thank your things for working hard for you. ""Thanks, underwear, for keeping my taint so cozy and warm today."" This metaphysical mumbo-jumbo will never stick to a cynic such as myself, but if you already talk to your shoes then you should be okay.Ultimately this book presents a no-holds-barred approach to tossing out things you don't need, and I think it's a method that I'm willing try. Just not the Frampton."
46,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/811928-forrest,Rating 4 out of 5,"My mother is a hoarder. There's no two ways about it. She never saw a thing she didn't want to keep. I don't want to go too deep into the psychology of it all, but mental illness plays a part in this. Thankfully, I didn't inherit the hoarding genes. I'm not a neat freak, either, not by any means. I, like most people, fall in the middle somewhere. I do recall, however, a time in my life when everything I owned fit into a military duffel bag (no, I was not in the military at the time). This lasted for about a year and, you know what? It felt good. Really good. But you fall in love, you get married, you have kids, and next thing you know, you've got stuff. Again, I'm not a hoarder, so it's not like I'm overburdened with my stuff. But we have a small home (I wouldn't have it any other way) and from time to time you just need to get rid of stuff.Most years, I will do spring cleaning of my wardrobe. This means I will toss a t-shirt or two that has become full of holes or a sweater that's become unraveled. If I'm feeling really ambitious, I will use the ""three year rule"" - if I haven't used it for three years, I get rid of it, unless I have a really good reason to keep it.This past year, I didn't do my normal spring cleaning. Also, my income is a lot more steady and I've earned a little extra from various writing projects, so I've had the luxury of buying a few more things, mostly books, as you might imagine.So when I stumbled across this title, I thought what the heck, I'll give this book a shot. I admit that, at first, my eyes rolled completely around in my head (I saw the inside of my skull) when I read the cutesie manner in which the book was written. But Kondo had some solid ideas, and if I set aside the ""twee,"" the book was actually pretty captivating and read very quickly. I'm not going to go into all the details of Kondo's methods, but they seemed to work for me. So far, I've only gone through my wardrobe, but I took two large bags of clothing to the Goodwill down the road from us and felt really good about it. The main gist of Kondo's method is ""if it brings you joy, keep it, if it doesn't, don't"". Now, I added the practical caveat that if it's something I use regularly or that serves a specific task that nothing else can serve, keep it. But by and large, she's got it right. Why saddle yourself with stuff that doesn't bring you joy?But what about those sentimental/nostalgic items? This is where I found her advice really useful. She notes that the joy of receiving gifts is mostly in the receiving. How many times have you kept something you didn't really want because someone gave it to you? They're happy about having given you something, your relationship was probably solidified by the giving of the gift, and you're better for having participated in that interaction. But do you really need to hold on to this thing that you don't really like and that serves no practical purpose in your life? Nope. Get rid of it. And do it all at once - don't try to nip and tuck, just suck it up and DO IT! That's how I cleaned my clothes out. One day. No time to get overly sentimental. Just do it.One thing that makes getting rid of these (and other) items more palatable seemed really cutesie to me, at first, but in looking back on the experience, this one ""trick"" helped me a great deal: Thank your item for the purpose it served. Yes, seriously, hold the item up and thank it. ""Thank you for serving as a great pair of shoes for so long,"" or ""thank you for bringing my friend joy by her giving of you to me"". It sounds ridiculous, but there is something psychologically freeing about saying the words aloud. Now, I need to go through my books. I love books. Some of them I love dearly. And some of them I have paid a good amount of money for. But when I look back, I have to ask myself: ""Which of these can I get from the library or online, if I really need them?"" and ""Which of these have I re-read, really?"" There are a few volumes that I've re-read multiple times and some that I know I must read again. Some are reference books that I use for my own writing (see my caveat above). But, in all honesty, I can sell off or give away a good portion of them and not miss them, if I'm honest with myself. So that's the next step. I don't have a certain number of books I want or need to get rid of, but I can quickly identify several that won't make the cut, that I will either give away or sell. Probably sell, so that I can buy others. And the circle continues. As some of you know, I've been trying to cut my TBR list down to about 50 titles. Some of those titles are rather expensive. So if I sell off a portion of the books I don't read, I might be able to afford some of those more expensive titles. And hopefully I'll love them enough to want to keep them. Or maybe I'll sell them off, in time, as well (hopefully at a return on investment - I'm sentimental, but I'm not stupid).After having gone through my clothes and given a couple large bags full away, I'm feeling like a lean, mean, fighting machine. Not spartan, mind you. But not a hoarder, either. I have what I need and if I need more, I'll get it. No sense in being burdened by un-necessary stuff.Books: you're next. I love you guys. But some of you will be even better loved at another home.Then, after the books, it's all the miscellaneous stuff. Actually, I can't wait to get to that. I'm guessing that this whole process will probably take me until the end of the summer or so? I did my clothes in one day. Books will take one full day. The other stuff? I dunno. That might take a while. But I'm going to do it. I feel too good after leaning down my clothes to the ones that give me joy to not do this with my other things. Cutesie or not, Kondo is on to something."

48,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33447134-book-riot-community,No Rating,"I was a little late to the KonMari party, but I’ve become a total evangelist for this magical little book! I first picked it up with the intention of giving it to a certain someone else, but eventually I realized that would be an extremely passive-aggressive move on my part. And then it was just sitting there, which annoyed me (I keep a very tidy home) so I decided to leaf through it and then get rid of it. Surely I didn’t need advice on cleaning my house…but at least I could see what all the fuss was about. Well, once again, I find myself picking my favorite read of the month largely on the basis of a book having far exceeded my expectations. Never in a million years did I imagine that reading The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up would have such an impact on my day-to-day levels of “joy,” as Marie Kondo would phrase it. Just looking at my socks neatly arrayed in their drawer, folded once and stood on end, makes me happy every time I open that drawer. Which is pretty much every day. And every time I open the closet that has been gloriously purged of items I rarely or never wear, a feeling of calm washes over me; I can see my remaining clothes hanging prettily, with a nice sliver of space between each garment instead of all smooshed up together like commuters on the Tokyo subway. Marie Kondo is fond of reminding you that your clothes seek joy, too, and that if you allow them to be their best selves you will feel their appreciation. It sounds corny, but I have to admit: I kinda do. And beyond the practical application of keeping an even tidier home than I already did, I’ve internalized a number of Marie Kondo’s lessons that have further-reaching applications than my bureau drawers. For example, she talks about people who can’t get rid of an item of clothing because they spent a lot of money on it, even though every time they take it out of the closet, they put it right back: it’s too tight, too short, too itchy, etc. She explains that this item of clothing has already fulfilled its purpose and provided value: it has shown you that you don’t look good in horizontal stripes; or that your inseam is really one inch longer; or that no matter how great it looks on a mannequin, that wool tank top is going to drive an actual person with actual skin absolutely crazy. You spent that money to learn those lessons, so you don’t have to feel like it was “wasted” if you want to get rid of the item of clothing. For me, that lesson was a gateway to a whole new way of thinking about lots of things in life, not just my sock drawer. I’m telling you: magic. — Sarah Knightfrom The Best Books We Read In July: http://bookriot.com/2015/08/03/riot-r..."
49,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1849990-carole,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up by Marie Kondo is an interesting read. Most of us know our homes could be a little more organized. Ms. Kondo's suggestions make quite a bit of sense. Most closets are bulging out and home offices have much more paperwork than necessary. The Kondo method advocates to examine items by kind rather than doing one room at a time. As the author says: every item we keep must ""spark joy"". So far, so good. However, I vehemently disagree with her about the sorting of books. She claims that only a few books should be kept in the home. I prefer to have books in most rooms, organized or not. A house without books is a house without a soul. So, I enjoyed the book and I may follow some of her suggestions, except when it comes to books."

The author repeatedly states how successful her methodology is without any failure, and she explains reasons for why her methods work not based on any science at all, but just her own personal beliefs that she makes up (for example, tidying up will make you lose weight). I found it difficult to take this book seriously just because these glaring flaws in her argument were so distracting, even if she may make good points about minimizing things that don't bring value or joy to your life."

53,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2575893-shannon,Rating 5 out of 5,"This review was going to be one sentence long, until I saw several bad reviews, all in a row, about Kondo's book. Now I'm going to go on a bit.While I did think Kondo seemed a bit neurotic at times, I can't think of a more practically life-changing book I've read this year. I've been on a soapbox for a while about Americans being slaves to their things (paying for storage for our stuff?? Come on, guys!). I am a huge purger. Yet clutter still happened in my home every day, adding visual noise to my already noisy life (I have two children under two, a cat who never stops meowing, and an innate compulsion to play music at all times). And as I came to find out, I was still surrounded by things I didn't need.Kondo's question of ""Does it spark joy?"" is a simple, easy-to-apply criterion in lieu of the complicated multitude of other questions I might ask while purging: ""Have I used it in two years?"" ""Will I use it any time in the next ten years?"" ""Should I keep this because I know my friend/mom/husband spent lots of money on it, even though I don't like it so I feel guilty any time I see it?"" (So I never really asked that last one, but gift-guilt was a real subtext of almost every look into my closet.) ""Does it spark joy?"" was so straightforward and revolutionary that my hoarder husband caught the vision, and now he keeps saying things like, ""I can't wait to purge my mementos!"" ...Guys, you don't know how long I've tried logic, reward systems, and even nagging to get him to purge just one book that he read 15 years ago. You don't know how many times we tried to purge using the used-in-the-past-year plan (failed), the will-I-use-this-again plan (""I might,"" he said), and the wife-guilt plan (bad idea, Shannon). Kondo's harshest critics on Goodreads point out, sometimes humorously and sometimes angrily, ""Is my chemotherapy medicine supposed to spark joy?"" ""Can I summon up enough joy to keep my carrot peeler?"" I have two responses to this criticism. 1) I took everything she said with a grain of salt. I have suspicions that she's a bit Adrian Monk-ish, and I'm not going to start bowing to my house or talking to purses. But she was a Shinto shrine maiden. Shinto teaches reverence for inanimate objects. Americans might think it's crazy, but it's not in Japan. Just because we don't understand some of her personal idiosyncrasies doesn't mean the truth she speaks isn't true. Using her own method, I can take the parts of this book that ""spark joy,"" and discard the rest. 2) Now that I've gotten rid of all the extraneous stuff that doesn't spark joy (old makeup! earrings from high school! books I felt I needed to keep because they were ""important literature"" and I had to prove my English major!), I do take more joy in the necessities like Tylenol or carrot peelers. I have this Tylenol, this carrot peeler, because I evaluated it and decided to keep it. It is not part of my out-of-control accumulation cycle. I made a conscious decision to keep this item, and I can be grateful that I own something so useful as headache medicine (and that it's all in one bottle, not in 10 different bottles scattered willy-nilly throughout the house. Can I get an amen?). I don't ask ""Does it spark joy?"" for every item. But I find that asking the question about most items makes me enjoy the necessities more.My husband and I are just finishing up Papers, and we can't wait to move on. To her insistence that I only needed three file folders, I said, ""Yeah...no."" But I did go through every one of my files, and our filing bulk has been cut by a little over 50%. Now I know what is in each and every one of the folders. I'm no longer keeping papers out of fear or because they ""look important so they must be."" I am more intentional about what I keep and how long I keep it. I feel more grown up. I feel more in control of my life. I find the same pattern occurring with each category we tackle. So, I love this book. I love to read it tranquilly with an iced coffee while my children nap. I love the vision Kondo casts for an uncluttered, peaceful space that is really possible to maintain. I love being free from excess. I love being intentional with my money and space. I haven't started talking to my dishes, but I think KonMari is sugoi!"

Listening to anyone talk about anything so simple in such minute detail is hypnotic. Go watch David Lynch making Quinoa on YouTube. Same effect. Anyway, it was enjoyable, not applicable to me, and kind of misses the point.Let me first state that this is pretty much how I live my life anyway, so I am hugely annoyed I didn't think to get rich from it. In fact, my ""why the hell do you have 400 sets of sheets and 30 tupperware containers and only 12 lids?"" has always been met with rudeness. Rudeness!Things I liked:- I live this way anyway, right down to the folding. I hate having stuff.- Feeling superior to everyone else mentioned in the book because I have a grand total of four t-shirts, two sleeveless blouses, three cardigans, and two pairs of pants. Go, wardrobe!- Hypnotic aspect.Things I disliked:- Don't fuckin' tell me I am not going to use spare buttons.- DONATE you assholes! Stop throwing out your clothes. Geez. Or, if you're a real tightwad, like me, sell it.- This is all sort of done from a position of privilege - I mean financial privilege. I don't choose what to keep and what to throw out/donate based on what sparks joy. When you live on less than $13,000/year, you go ""does this serve a purpose?"" If no, why the hell do you have it when you can sell it for $2 on craigslist? All of my socks have holes in them, but I'm not throwing them out. Why? Because I need socks and, quite frankly, I don't have any expendable income to replace things willy nilly. A lot of people don't.Things that confused me:- What about your spouse's stuff? A lot of the people in the book seem to be sorting through it all. Never ever ever would I throw out Adam's stuff. Not even his entire milk crate full of cables, which I hate.My biggest issue with the book, aside from her kind of outlandish claims (detoxing your house does not detox your body - if you get the shits, you ate something that disagreed with you. Period. Your liver does the detoxing) I think she, and her weirdly fanatical followers, have largely missed the point. It is touched on in the book, but it's not the focus. The focus of the book is discarding.She says she's had clients who've left bad relationships, pursued their dreams, are generally happier now, etc. all because of tidying. That's it. That's as far as she goes. It's not because of tidying. It's about cultivating a life that is meaningful to you. When you aren't so reckless with your disposable income, spending on whatever tacky designer bag catches your eye, and you only but things that make you happy or serve a purpose, you're creating a life that is full of good stuff. Making these decisions leads to other decisions -- if you want to source most things locally or ethically and you have a partner who doesn't, that's an idealogical difference that you maybe can't get over - to the curb they go! Or maybe you realise your lazy husband doesn't spark joy. Or your job. Whatever. It's not tidying that's made the difference. It's making a conscious decision to make a life that has meaning, that makes you happy, that fulfills your needs.If this gets more people to stop being such mindless consumers, great. It's not for everyone, but it's funny at least."
55,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57354360-sarah,Rating 3 out of 5,"2020 non fiction book 4 out 12 This little book of tidying up took the world by storm and revolutionised the self-help genre, so I figured it would only be fitting for me to try this one as a part of my non-fiction journey. Inevitably, some of the bits of advice hit home and others were less applicable to my life. I found some of the things Marie Kondo said to be slightly outrageous and without any scientific evidence to back it up (such as tidying is guaranteed to make you loose weight and turn your life around). So while I appreciated a few nuggets of advice and a general inspiration to clean my room, I was a bit skeptical and couldn't get past a few things. 
My main takeaways
➽ I don't really need all that stuffperiod. I just don't. ➽ Be a little more grateful while I most certainly will not be thanking my shoes everytime I take them off or stop balling up my socks to give them time to relax, this book made me realise I can be more appreciative of what I have. ➽ Her method of tidying While it can initially be overwhelming to take everything into one space, it really helps to get some perspective about how much you have, and don't need. By physically moving everything out and having to put the items back one by one it helped me realise the unnecessary things instead of defaulting back. ➽ Does it spark joy?I know this become the butt of many jokes, but I genuinely find it to be good advice in some aspects. While more practical objects may be exceptions (I don't personally find sponges or forks to spark joy) I found it to be really useful going through more sentimental items. 
Things I didn't love 
➽ themes of gender conformitythis could be a part of the cultural difference, but I really didn't appreciate how she reaffirmed the outdated notion that women are the ones who should tidy and do the housework. Other pieces of advice were directed specifically at men or women, and I didn't see the value in them. ""If you are a woman try wearing something elegant as nightwear. The worst thing you can do is to wear a sloppy sweatsuit.""➽ occasionally classist adviceIf you aren't sure that you need something- throw it away! You can always repurchase it later if you need it.Ummm... ok This is something I personally, and I am sure many others simply cannot afford to do. While this may be a fine notion for upper class people, this is not applicable for the majority of us. ➽ the advice about booksthis is a sore spot for the majority of book lovers who read this book, I gather. When she talked about ripping out her favourite parts of books to save space my heart felt like it was getting ripped too. What happened to the rest of them? Also, I have personally read quite a few books that I had kept on my shelves for years that ended up becoming some of my favourites. Just because it isn't the right time now doesn't mean it never will be. "

Does this spark joy?
 Decluttering and organizing. I think we could all use a little of that in our lives. I know I could. My closets are overflowing, my kitchen and bathroom not as organized as I'd like, and my condo, while clean, isn't as 'tidy' as I wish it was. This book gives many ideas on ways to efficiently declutter and organize your house. Tomorrow I'm planning on going through ALL my clothing and giving it a go so crossing fingers. I do love the concept of 'If something you own doesn't give you joy- get rid of it'. However, I'm not about to start thanking my purse every day for carrying my wallet ;) And also- that section about books... yeah. Sorry. ALLLLLLL my books bring me joy so no need to even mess with that! I'm excited to take some of the main principles in this book (especially the decluttering and folding of clothes) and put them in place!"

58,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb,Rating 2 out of 5,"I barely know where to begin. I like to de-clutter and organize and some might consider me a neatnik. But this book takes it to a new level. A woo-woo level. I don't think unused objects in my home want to leave and will be happier if I set them free nor do I think my possessions need to be reassured that there's a place for them to return to. It has never occurred to me to remove labels from packages and containers (such as laundry detergent) so my closets and cupboards aren't ""noisy"". The author was driven to tears at the ""slime"" that developed on wire shelving in her shower and recommends drying and putting away your soap and shampoo bottles after every shower. Um, nope, not going to happen in my house, Nor will I empty my purse every night because it would be ""cruel"" to not give my purse a break.The author gasped and was speechless when she opened a client's sock drawer and saw socks rolled up in potato-like lumps that rolled about. They work hard all day and take a beating trapped between your foot and shoe. Balled up in your drawer, they roll around and bump into each other. What treatment could be worse than this? (that is a direct quote).There were a few nuggets of good information but nothing you can't read in an online article on organization. Experiencing contentment by being surrounded by things you either use or love is a worthy goal. But worrying about the psychological well-being of my possessions is too far out there for me. I have no idea how this landed on the bestseller list. But it was good for a few chuckles and a belly laugh or two :-)"
59,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,Rating 3 out of 5,"I admire Marie Kondo for her tenacity. Throughout this book, she makes an argument - only keep what brings you joy - and sticks to it without fault. I most enjoyed reading this because of Kondo's clear commitment to her intentions: we so often treat our material goods with little care or thought, but Kondo urges us to examine each and every possession we own to see if it adds meaning in our lives. I appreciated the gratitude and compassion she showed her possessions, as well as the final part of the book where she stresses that tidying, an act that should not take forever, allows us to begin our lives by freeing us from our fear of the past and the future. Kondo has ambition, and she brings innovative ideas to the table, meriting this book's three-star rating.Recommended for those who want a true minimalist cleaning experience and feel open to new ideas. Though I do not own many things at this point in my life, I look forward to implementing some of Kondo's techniques later on. The writing in this book is as captivating as one as one can expect from a self-help book about tidying; I am thankful Kondo gave us some glimpses into her life to add flavor to these pages."

That was until I saw this as suggested reading for those struggling with anxiety and depression. I was, at that point, desperate for a miracle cure, or really just anything to help me get through the day. So desperate, in fact, that I bought this book whilst still firmly believing that it was going to be rubbish!How wrong could I have been?This book has absolutely changed my entire life and my outlook on it. This is not just a book about putting your house in order, but your mind as well. There are specific ways to fold clothes and to stack your belongings that will make your house and your heart happy and your mind will finally be at peace. If it means anything at all, this is my testimony that this actually works! I felt, for the first time in forever, that I could finally exhale! I felt at peace not just in my house but in myself as well. I felt motivated to go out, exercise, work on my writing (of which I have been in a slump for months) and just become a healthier and happier individual.This book is about far more than throwing out that three-year-old threadbare pair of jeans, it is about transforming your entire life, beginning with your physical space."

Is it really ""tidying"" when all you're doing is throwing away half of your belongings? I do agree with the idea of de-cluttering, but I have a hard time believing that nobody who has ever used this method has ""rebounded"", as she keeps claiming.On another note, this woman is bizarre as hell. Who honestly has the time to thank every object in their purse when they clean it? And goddamn it, Kondo, you can take my books from me when you pry them from my cold, dead fingers. YES, they ALL spark joy when I touch them. REALLY.On another note, if you're looking for weird, unintended humor, 5 stars."

Her program is highly demanding and would not be easy for anyone with a job to do without a huge disruption for several months at a time.Also:She encourages the mutilation of books instead of copying your favourite texts down.

They didn't touch my books because none of them were tired of life & I think my husband got off lightly - until recently he had kept every pay slip since 1985. He only got rid of them once he couldn't get anything else into his bedside cabinet. But Kondo is right - I felt a lot lighter & freer without what was mostly useless junk.Some Goodreaders may have trouble getting alongside the KonMari method because of Kondo's attitude to books.She writes with horror about clients (Kondo has managed to turn her OCD into a way of making a living & more power to her) who have 40 unread books. Pffft! Lightweights. I have at least 100. But, a few months ago I did go through every shelf & by coincidence I did use a form of KonMari. I dumped a pile in each room & looked through each one. I didn't think ""does this give me joy?"" I asked myself if I thought ""will I ever read/reread this?"" & I discarded if the answer was no & there was no sentimental attachment. I get a lot of pleasure from looking at my now alphabetically ordered shelves - particularly my ""to-read"" shelf. Once again, my failure was my husband. He went through his huge pile of (unread)sports autobiographies (one of the great cons of the literary world - no one reads those things) & finally agreed to part with four. But in this world, you can only change yourself.I really agree with Kondo about guilt gifts. My mother would do this. Give me clothes she no longer wanted. I would take them so as not to hurt her feelings & stuff them in a drawer. That was transferring her clutter to my house. Don't do that. & I will get on my soapbox and say don't give useless junk to your local op (charity) shop. By all means give things that are of no use to you but could be of use to another person but not things like colouring books that have already been coloured in, chipped dishes, shoes with broken heels. Take responsibility for your rampant consumerism and take useless rubbish to the tip. (Yes, I volunteer at an op shop - how did you guess?)& I'm going to KonMari next time we sort clothes. I now have one small wardrobe & my husband has 2. (but Kondo would just love how beautifully he hangs his clothes!) Today I'm going to try her sushi style socks storing - not because I'm worried they are sobbing in pain,but because I think they might last longer.Nothing will get me to start talking to my house and belongings - enough people think I'm crazy talking to a cat that hates me without having a relationship with inanimate objects. But if the clutter in your house is starting to overwhelm you this book could help."

While the show captures her basic techniques of dealing with clutter – there's nothing like seeing real people put her theories to the test – so far it has only hinted at her philosophy.But Kondo's gentle, non-judgemental, Zen-like spirit is one of the things I most like about this book. According to Kondo, we should greet our home every time we enter it. At the end of the day, we should thank our wallet, transit pass, clothes, shoes, etc., for helping us on our journey. And when discarding things that don't ""spark joy"" – her signature phrase – we should thank them for their use. I also love how she makes us think about how difficult life is for some of the stuff in our homes. When we stack books horizontally, one on top of the other in some wild Jenga pile, the books at the bottom bear the brunt of all that weight. I do feel sorry for them, and the little dust bunnies that collect around their pages. Much nicer that they stand upright and organized.I can also see her point about how decluttering will make us more focused and less stressed. She has one beautiful story in the book about a woman who pared her book collection down to only volumes that sparked joy. And looking at them she realized what her true interests were, and subsequently changed her profession. Only by decluttering did she realize what she loved to do in life.One day I will clean up my condo the KonMari way. And when I do, I'll collect all my clothes and all my books in one enormous pile before sorting them, feeling each item in my hands to see if it sparks joy.I'm not ready to do that yet. But when I do I'll definitely be flipping through this lovely book."

I do this from time to time. Think 'The girl on the train', 'Gone Girl', 'Fifty shades of grey'. I did not need to read this book.To an extent, I do this stuff anyway. I turf what I don't love (as I am a mega thrift shop/charity store shopper. The majority of my work dresses and pants are bought in this fashion) and I hang nicely (for the most part). I don't keep what I don't like. But I do not fold properly, or divide carefully in drawers. In fact, only this morning before work, did my bag shelf clip holder (you know those white clips that prop the shelf up?) fell off and I had to re stock my bag shelf. She came to mind where she suggested packing bags within bags. This didn't make sense, I just flattened all the bags and popped them on top of each other nice and flatly. I didn't really understand the folding techniques; my wardrobe is nothing like hers, and these, I skimmed. I put my keys in the same place every day after work, and my work bag as well. But I do not get the spark joy part; I do not talk to my belongings. I simply fold, place and hope for the best that the piles don't topple. I am partial to not always trying on my online items straight away, but this is a little due to my avoidant personality. The part about books, ripping out pages you enjoy just does not sit at all well with me. I keep my favourite books on my little IKEA cube system. I have kept about 20 of these faves, and own about 600 still to be unread. And that, my friends, is fine by me. Put simply I'm a little anal, but I am a library worker. I like to catalogue my bookshelves (physical and Goodreads) and quite simply have that scientific sorting vibe. But.. yes, I am still scattered when it comes down to it all. Make sense?

Her folding methods have helped make laundry a soothing exercise. Cleaning out my kitchen has made food shopping so much more simplified. I no longer guilt myself about wearing things in my closet I don't really like just because they're there- because they aren't anymore. I gave away items I got from family members I never liked instead of staring at them guiltily every time I didn't use them/wear them/got mad at them for taking up space. I have a well organized space for skincare in my bathroom that has made me get into a constant routine in a way I didn't before. Marie Kondo is a person who really really loves doing a very specific skill, and has loved doing it since she was a child. As with many people who have done that-she's arrived at some ideas that both feel very truthful and are very effective at the same time. I am a stereotypical woman in her early 30s.

I don't know if I'll ever have the discipline to do the whole KonMari shebang (though seeing photos of my friends' trash bags makes me giddy with inspiration), but something that really resonated with me was the idea of being thankful for the objects that come into your life and letting them go with gratitude if they don't bring you joy in the present moment. You don't have to hold onto a gift someone gave you but never use; the purpose of the thing was to convey love and affection in the giving, and after that the toaster or turtleneck wants you to let it go.The animism may seem goofy (""Thank you, socks, for keeping my feet warm today! Go have a rest!"") but we fetishize our stuff so much already ... why not turn that impulse into something positive?"

Everything she mentions makes sense- if something doesn't spark joy, discard it (except you know- cleaning supplies, garbage cans, and other misc things that definitely do NOT spark joy, but are necessary evils). If you haven't used something, chances are likely that you do not need these items either.

But, between my roommate and myself, we decided that we must have gotten rid of around 50 bags of stuff when we went through the book.You probably know the basic premise by now, but I'll tell you anyway. Marie Kondo, codename KonMari, spent her entire life figuring out how to tidy. Eventually, she came upon the solution. You go through all of your stuff, hold it in your hands, and decide if it sparks joy. She tells you to go through your things by categories, also, rather than by room. It's so fun!Here are my clothes:

Here's a bunch of my other crap:

Here's my closet after tidying:

The thing was that I had a bunch of stuff that I thought I needed on top of all the stuff I loved. So now, when I look around, all the stuff I love is there, and I actually didn't need that other stuff anyway. One caveat is that her section on books is . . . troubling. I'm sorry to tell you that there is a whole part where she talks about mutilating her favorite books and pasting passages into folders to minimize how much space they take. Shudder. She no longer recommends that, thank god, but she does not go gently with the book section, so reader beware.I think the most helpful part of this book is that going through the process trains you to find joy in your surroundings. I did it again today, and it was great, so I thought I would tell you all. I'm starting up my life coaching business, and I want to add some tidying to it. I'm going to try helping a law client with her tidying, to test out how it can fit into the work I already do. It's so great that I have to share!"

74,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44131812-susan-budd,Rating 4 out of 5,"My younger self was mighty surprised when I showed up. But there was no time for pleasantries. I had fifteen minutes and I was determined not to waste them. I just started rifling through her stuff as she stood there astonished. When she finally grabbed my arm, I brushed her hand away and quickly gave the speech I had prepared. (Always a good practice when time traveling.) I stated who I was and from whence (or rather, when) I had come, and most importantly, why I was there. I am a declutterer by nature. I find a cluttered and disorganized living space to be a constant source of distraction. I like for everything to have its place and for there to be a logical order to things. My earliest memories have me rearranging and organizing my things to achieve the perfect gestalt. There was a science to it. It began with an assessment of each thing to determine its various attributes and how those attributes related to everything else. I would feel satisfaction when I got things properly sorted, labeled, lined up, stacked straight, balanced, color-coordinated, boxed, shelved, or displayed at the ideal angle. I have a vague recollection of a nursery I was constructing out of a cardboard box for my Sweet April doll. What delighted me most was acquiring all the accoutrements the doll required and then arranging everything in the most pleasing and logical way, creating a space so well-ordered that its order would radiate to the four corners of the earth. Or something like that. I have no memory of actually playing with the doll.In real life, the difficulty of creating order is exacerbated by the near impossibility of maintaining order. For things come and go. At first, they mostly come. This is the stage of acquisition. But in childhood, things get outgrown quickly. Baby dolls get replaced by Barbie dolls who get replaced by pet rocks who die of neglect.I discarded the things I had outgrown, as if to say, I am no longer this person. I cast off all that was incongruous with my new persona. Each phoenix-like rebirth was predicated on the complete incineration of the previous incarnation. Later there were the moves. As a young adult, I changed apartments frequently, each time purging the things I no longer needed or wanted: clothes, books, furniture, trinkets, mementos. Whereas some people say “I may need this some day,” I say “I don’t need this anymore.” Whereas some people say “I may want this some day,” I say “I don’t want this anymore.” Whereas some people say “It doesn’t take up much space,” I say “It takes up way too much space.” That’s because stuff takes up space in my head as well as my home, so a hairclip takes up as much space as a credenza.In the past I was more interested in order than minimalism. Apart from the hassles of moving, I wasn’t much bothered by the amount of things I owned. I was only bothered by crowding and disorder. For most of my life the urge to acquire outpaced the urge to declutter, so more things were coming in than going out. It took quite a while before more things were going out than coming in. I’ll call this phase late middle age. It coincides with my growing nostalgia. I find myself easily discarding the dross I have accumulated in later years and missing the things from my early years, the things I tossed away so insouciantly. I discovered late that I needed not only to acquire the right things; I also needed to not discard the wrong things. But back then, things were merely things: stupid things or awesome things, but still just things. Now things hold memories of people, places, phases of my life that I would not otherwise remember. It’s curious that things can do this, but they can. For proof, I submit this example. I recently picked up an old paperback book. It is one of the few I kept from my college days. When I opened it there was a Barnes & Noble receipt inside. One of the old kind of receipts, so the ink is unfaded. I bought that book in the Fifth Avenue store on November 12, 1984. That little slip of paper is physical evidence that I existed thirty-six years ago. In case you think my existence here and now is proof enough that I existed in ‘84: No, it is not. I assume that I existed in ‘84 because I accept certain conventional beliefs about the nature of time and reality. I know in my head that I existed in ‘84, but that’s just an abstract fact. When I took that receipt out of that book, the continuity of my existence became concrete and tangible. That heavily tanned book is the real thing. Some Barnes & Noble cashier sold it to me one day in that bookstore. Was it cold that November day? Had I taken the subway from home, or did I pop down there after class at Hunter College? I will never remember those details. But I have evidence that it all happened.If only more treasures from the past had survived the succession of purges that has been my life with things! And this brings me to declutterer extraordinaire Marie Kondo.I didn’t read The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up to inspire myself to declutter. I already do that. I didn’t read it to learn a system for decluttering. I have a system. I read it because I was curious about her philosophy. I wanted to know why she likes to tidy, or as I usually express it, to create order out of chaos. Kondo does not disappoint. She tells a little about her childhood, about being a loner, about her complicated relationships with things. She also shares her theory on the urge to declutter. “Many people get the urge to clean up when under pressure .... It occurs because they need to put ‘something else’ in order” (20).She connects the urge to declutter and organize our living spaces with the desire to declutter and organize our lives. Like Kondo, I have always sought order, simplicity, and perfection. Also like Kondo, it took me a while to discover the perils of storage containers. I could very much relate to an experience she describes from her youth: She wanted to discard some books, but they had certain passages she liked, so she decided to copy those passages into a notebook. This proved to be too much work, so she tried photocopying them and pasting them into the notebook. But that was also too much work. Then she hit upon the solution of photocopying them and putting them into a file. Two years later she realized that she never looked at the file. Her effort to condense her clutter was nothing but a waste of time (93-95). I have engaged in such useless busywork more times than I care to mention. This anecdote comes from her section on books ~ a hot topic here on Goodreads. Some of you must have needed smelling salts after reading the phrase “discard some books.”Even though I’m discussing things in general, not specifically books, a word about books seems apropos here. When Kondo writes ~ “In the end, you are going to read very few of your books again” (89) ~ I can only laugh and say: “Have you met me?” To be fair, I wasn’t always a rereader. In my youth, I never reread. There were too many unread books for me to give any book a second reading. But that changed after I read C. S Lewis’ Experiment in Criticism. That book plus my growing nostalgia inspired me to reread a few of the books of my youth. Nowadays about half of the books I read are rereads. It has been very rewarding to re-experience books I first read twenty, thirty, forty or more years ago and connect with my younger self. (Metaphorically connect that is, not literally like when I showed up in her room with that ridiculous time travel helmet on my head.)But back to Marie Kondo. After that silly statement about rereading, she utters this blasphemy: “Books are essentially paper (89). In rebuttal I refer you, fellow reader, to my comments about the book in which I found that receipt from November 12, 1984. And this brings me to my only real criticism of this book. Kondo addresses the reader’s fear that by discarding things, the memories associated with those things will be lost.“Truly precious memories will never vanish even if you discard the objects associated with them” (114).Kondo published The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up in 2011. She was twenty-seven years old at the time. I discarded stuff left and right when I was twenty-seven too. Now I know better.Truly precious memories can indeed vanish. At least for me they can. I cherish the memories I have and I welcome inspirations that will bring more forgotten memories to the surface.There’s nothing like holding an artifact in my hands, making a tactile connection with a real thing from the past. That book I plucked off the shelf of a Manhattan bookstore in 1984 is the same book I now hold in my hands on this day in 2020. That book is more than mere paper. It is a relic from an earlier time and an earlier incarnation of me.They say the cells in our bodies are replaced every seven years. While this may not be scientifically true, it is poetically true. We are always being remade, both physically and psychologically. Our bodies change. The young woman who bought that book had not a gray hair on her head. And our personae change as well. Many a style, affectation, and pastime have I adopted and then abandoned in my quest to “find myself.” In contrast, the receipt inside that paper book is the same as it was thirty-six years ago. That little bit of paper is less ephemeral than I am. Memory, says Locke, is what creates the continuity of the self. So what happens when memories are lost? Is some fragment of the self lost with each lost memory? Kondo has little regard for the past. “No matter how wonderful things used to be, we cannot live in the past. The joy and excitement we feel here and now are more important” (114). This is a young person’s philosophy. The past matters little when there is little of it and when it is recent enough to be easily recalled. But as the years become decades, there comes to be more past than future and the distant past grows ever more distant. My younger self did not know the value of so many of the things she tossed away. How could she? It is only in retrospect that those things have value. Surely there is some middle ground between hoarding and ruthless decluttering. That middle ground is saving just the right things, just the things that will have the most sentimental value later. But how does one know which things are the right things? I’ll leave that question for others to answer. I took the easy way out. As she stood there hardly believing her eyes, I raided her closets, piling up all the things I wanted her to save. Onto the pile went a groovy suede handbag I bought in a head shop. A purple paisley ribbon wide enough to be worn as a headband. My mood ring. Buffalo sandals. A macramé purse. A braided suede choker. Gauze blouses from India with block prints and bubble sleeves. Many with matching skirts. A little koala bear that gripped my pencil (and later the sun visor in my VW bug). My vintage Vonnegut paperbacks, the ones with the bold-colored covers. Yellow for Player Piano. Red for Cat’s Cradle. Blue for God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater. And so on. A dazzling array of mass market paperbacks. Mostly science fiction and fantasy. Boxed sets of The Perelandra Trilogy and The Chronicles of Narnia. The Earthsea Trilogy with the gray cover art by Pauline Ellison. The Lord of the Rings with the gold spines which were originally Mom’s books.Also on the pile went the few things that somehow did survive the decades. My vintage Hesse paperbacks. My patched and faded Lee jeans. The puka shell choker Nana gave me not long before she died. The suede fringe jacket that my horse-loving parents bought for me at the riding supply store in Elmont, Long Island. I wore it throughout high school and later college.By the time my fifteen minutes were up it looked like the 70s exploded in the middle of her room. As I felt myself fading away, I used my final second to shout one last piece of advice: Mind that opal. It was an heirloom ring. I wore it every day until I carelessly cracked the stone.

75,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4636758-vanessa,Rating 2 out of 5,"2.5 stars.I guess it's kind of weird to read a book on tidying, but I've always had some interest in minimalism and de-cluttering and the like, and particularly in the last year or so. I've got rid of so many CDs, DVDs, clothes, and books over the last year, and get a mad little rush every time I donate or sell another bag. In terms of tidyness though, I'm hopeless, so I figured this book would maybe help me on my way to being a tidy person.I definitely have taken away some tips and tricks from this book, and for that I am thankful. I am in the process of moving out of the family home and into my own place for the first time, and now that my boyfriend and I will have our very own shared space, I want to make the most of it and keep it clutter free. However, I did have some issues with Marie Kondo and her 'KonMari Method'.I find it easier with a book like this to discuss my pros and cons in the form of lists, so here goes...Pros:- I loved the idea of how to fold clothes to achieve maximum space and accessibility. I tried her approach of folding clothes to stand upright alongside each other with my numerous jumpers, and what a difference! So easy to find things and put them back, and so much more space, so this is something I'd like to incorporate with my entire wardrobe once I move out.- The order of discarding: I liked the fact that she left personal mementos and things of that nature to the end, and I liked her approach in particular to sorting photographs and gifts as those are some things I particularly struggle with, in a guilty sort of way.- The stories of people and their experiences that she has worked with throughout: I particularly liked the advice (based on one experience with a 'client') about not showing your parents anything that you plan on donating. I've had this issue with my mum so many times where she removes things from the bags because she or my sister might use them. Never happens.- The item group approach: I always went room by room when tidying, as Kondo points out that many people do, but now it makes so much more sense to tackle things like clothes and books together. I'll definitely be utilising this more in the future.Cons:- The anthropomorphising of inanimate objects. These are items, they do not have souls. Good lord, if I thought all my clothes, my bag, etc. had feelings and my treatmeant of them hurt them or wore them out, I'd never get anything done! This was so incredibly twee, and although it was funny at first, after a while it became laughable (in a not so funny way). - Her treatment of books. Kondo claims she is a book lover, but she also claims that any book on your shelf that you intend to read but haven't already will never be read, and you should get rid of it. That is absolute nonsense, and actually made me angry. We have all our lives to read our books, and I have got to books a few years down the line after buying them - it's not something that never happens. Not only that, but the ultimately useless defacing of books?? ARGHRGHRJGHKJHGKJ.- Her encouragement of throwing things away: no no no no. We donate, or sell things that are good enough to be passed on. Kondo however glorifies people with 20-50 bin bags worth of stuff to be chucked. Now, this may be a translation error, and she might not mean binning, but I just felt that it stunk of someone who was financially privileged, and the idea of such waste frustrated me.- Her attitude to clearing out other people's things: this actually made me cringe with embarrassment and annoyance. In her past she spoke of throwing out her family's belongings at times because they wouldn't do it themselves. How incredibly pig-headed and selfish! I wouldn't dream of throwing out Adam's stuff, even if it drove me to distraction. Jesus.- Her attitude to loungewear: this may seem silly, but I personally love wearing comfy, less than attractive clothes around the house. Kondo brings up the opinion that people shouldn't lounge around in clothes they wouldn't be seen in outwith the house, as it makes your appearance look slobby. Essentially. Well I for one am not going to spend un-necessary pounds on feminine things simply to wear to bed. So stupid.As you can see, the cons outweighed the pros. I'm not going to say that this wasn't a good read, as it was quite light and entertaining for the most part, and it definitely did give me some food for thought. Overall though I thought the book was quite problematic at times, and I still can't believe that people pay Marie Kondo to come in and help them sort their stuff out. How much money does she charge for this? The book doesn't teach us how to be eternally tidy, but does more of the same thing that most organisational/minimalism blogs do (albeit with some more novel approaches) - ironically these blogs are the things that Kondo says do not matter, whereas her approach will eliminate the need to tidy ever again! That smells quite strongly of self-promotion of her business to me, and I'm surprised that I kind of forget that was what this book was all about along the way.I can understand her point of view when she says that having a clean and tidy living space can effect other elements of life such as health, stress, etc. I have felt this particularly in my own life in the occasional times where my space has been clutter-free. However, some of the lengths she goes to convince her readers of this are extraordinary, and quite misleading. Sure, some of her contacts will have got divorces or left jobs to pursue other careers after having completed her course, but I highly doubt that this is the norm, and I definitely don't think this is a by-product of tidying. I also think it's quite mis-leading to have almost a whole section of the book devoted to this, as it feels like false advertising.The book itself was sweet and readable for the most part, but I found myself noticing the same point and phrases throughout. I don't think I want to see the phrase 'does this spark joy?' for quite a long time - it just didn't need to be stated that often! I would like to say that I found the book innocent in its message and just there to help, but unfortunately as it essentially promotes a business I can't really be that naive.I won't be keeping this book, as I'm pretty sure the things that I've taken away from it will stay in my head (and there are enough youtube videos online to help remind me of the KonMari Method), so I will be taking Kondo's advice in terms of discarding it. I'll be donating it though, not throwing it away."

The writing is straightforward and easy to follow, and the message is all you need is just enough to live, no more, no less. That's the key to maintaining a tidy home.Marie Kondo is a lifestyle coach who specializes in helping people tidy up their lives, both literally and figuratively. She believes that having a clean living space will open your mind to creativity, lessen stress, promote a healthy lifestyle, and make you happy. Those are high expectations for a clean home.

I give it a good grade, because I agree with the main thought, that you should throw out things you don't need. You should clean up once, and keep things in order, and you shouldn't make a small list of things to clean up and spread it on every days in a week. This is self help book, so there is, of course, the main advice ""just do it""."

Като гледам какво огромно количество излишни боклуци хората пазят в къщите си само защото не им стиска да ги изхвърлят, въпреки, че събират прах с години, има голяма нужда от такава книга. Имам приятел, който в гардероба си държи над 50 ризи, носи сигурно десетина, другите не ги е обличал от години, половината не му стават вече - но така си стоят и няма място за нищо в гардероба. Един о�� бичовете на съвременния начин на живот е именно трупането на предмети и дрехи, които всъщност не ползваме, но някак ни е съвестно да хвърлим или мислим, че ""може да потрябват"". Постепенно домовете ни се превръшат в складове за стари боклуци, на които не можем да намерим място.Авторката е японка, която е посветила живота си на изкуството на подреждането и професионално се занимава с даване на уроци по подреждане (което е особено важно за малките японски жилища). Мари Кондо безспорно попада някъде в лекия спектър на аутизма и/или обсесивно-компулсивн��те разстройства, но както се казва, не е важно дали котката е черна или бяла, а дали лови мишки. И когато става дума за подреждане и чистене, трудно ще намерите някой по-добър от тоя тип хора.КонМари системата, която тя е измислила и представя в първата си книга наистина отваря очите и може да ви помогне да сложите дома си в ред и да ви мотивира да се отървете от много излишни вещи, които го задръстват, въпреки склонността на мацката да гушка сгънатите си пуловери и да обяснява удоволствието, което я пронизвало докато си подрежда чорапите.Отделно, трябва да се отбележи, че настояването на Мари Кондо да говорим на дома и дрехите си, да им благодарим и т.н. не са откачени измислици, а проста форма на самомотивация и дори когнитивна поведенческа терапия. Когато преди да изнесете презентация гледате огледалото и се надъхвате със ""Знам, че можеш!"", всъщност не говорите на огледалото, а на себе си, нали? Същото е и с вещите - много хора са толкова емоционално привързани към вещите си, че имат нужда от такова надъхване, за да се разделят с тях."

84,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82752791-lilli,Rating 4 out of 5,"Anticipate a more extensive review once I’ve finished tidying lol! It's been several years since minimalism came into the mainstream and Marie Kondo's book began flying off shelves all around the world. Her method of tidying and organizing homes, the KonMari method, truly got to the heart of why minimalism was beginning to take off in such a powerful way: we are lumbered down by the sheer volume of belongings we have, and the messiness and cramped feelings in our homes were beginning to be reflected by the messy, cramped feelings in our minds. I know I personally struggle enormously when my house is a mess and things are chaotically disorganized. I hate not knowing what or how much I have. I use cleaning and organizing as an excuse for procrastination, but the thought of confronting it all gets overwhelming and I end up doing neither cleaning, organizing, nor whatever it was I was procrastinating doing in the first place. For this reason, I have long been drawn to this book and to Marie Kondo's Netflix programming and other work, but haven't taken the time to read this entire book until now.Kondo encourages her readers and followers to cultivate a relationship with their belongings and their homes as if they were alive. Many readers probably find her greeting of her house and thanking of her purse and shoes for the hard work they've done for her to be a bit kooky and over-the-top, but I believe within her culture, this makes sense. And there is no harm in thinking this way; being more thoughtful of how our items function and how we treat them allows us to be more mindful of our own selves and how we interact with the world around us, and stopping to consider these things helps us to avoid taking what we have in this life for granted.The number one message Kondo is driving home in her book is that we should surround ourselves only with what sparks joy, and that the more decision-making we do about what those things are, the more intuitively we are able to surround ourselves with only those items that truly serve us as we strive towards the vision we hold for our lives. She instructs readers to sort through the items in their home by category, beginning with clothing followed in order by books, papers, komono (miscellaneous items) and finally sentimental items. This order is recommended because decision-making is easier with the items she suggests sorting through first and becomes more difficult as you progress through the categories. By the time you reach a more difficult category such as sentimental items, your decision-making abilities are honed, and identifying what truly sparks joy in your life becomes a passive skill.I have yet to fully tidy my house, but first came across this book and her show several years back. Without necessarily meaning to, I have trained myself to shop this way and only buy things that truly spark joy, and I have gotten more diligent over time about discarding belongings that do not serve me in this way as I come across them. When I try something on and it just doesn't make me happy to wear that item, it immediately goes in a donation box. When I'm cooking and use a pan or utensil that is outworn and has outlived its purpose, in the box it goes. I haven't tidied my home all in one go, but I read this book after tidying my garage with these standards and feel confident that I'll be able to make this my goal for the remainder of the month. So keep an eye out for an updated review; I'll tell you what worked and didn't work for me! I'm also hoping to make a video about my process, so if I do end up doing that, I'll link that here as well!While the criticisms of this book are entirely merited and this is not a system that works for everyone, I personally love Marie Kondo. If you were put off by this book and it was too out there for you, I highly recommend her Netflix shows so you can visualize just how effective this process can be for folks from all different walks of life! I think she’s such a sweet little neurotic weirdo and although I won’t be drying off my shampoo bottles after each use or emptying my purse every day, I appreciate her love and care for the items that serve us in our daily lives. I totally agree with the main sentiment of her work, which is that we live with such abundance that it becomes all too easy to lose sight of what is important and makes us happy. I’m hoping to spark much joy in my home with her tips!"
85,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3764614-ashley-cruzen,Rating 3 out of 5,"So here's the thing...I'm by no means an expert on books about cleaning your house. I'm not entirely sure how you go into rating such books, but I do have some thoughts. For now, it'll settle in the ""3 stars cause I don't know what else to do with it"" spot.-Repetition. This book was endlessly repetitive and at times the writing was strange. I'm not sure if it's because of the translation, but it could have easily 'discarded' 50 more pages in an effort to spark more joy. --You want me to...what? Talk to my socks? No. Empty my purse every day? No, definitely not. Dry my dishes on the 'veranda'? Where do you think I live? I don't have a god damn veranda. Dry my shampoo bottle every time I get out of the shower? Surely you can't think I'm THAT committed to the cause.---Ok but on a more serious note, this book does have a really solid methodology for people like me who aren't quite hoarder status, but really need to learn to let go of things. I keep things solely because I paid for them, they are perfectly usable, or someone gave it to me even though I have never used them, only find them when I move, or they just plain get in the way. I still have clothes from 10 years ago I won't get rid of because there is technically nothing wrong with them. I will definitely be trying 'KonMari'ing' my clothes to start, and we'll see how it goes from there. I have officially reached the point in my life where I constantly feel stressed by how much stuff I have and how long it takes me to find the things I actually want to use.Perhaps I will come back and update this review afterwards and see how well it has served me."
86,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26259-jenne,Rating 4 out of 5,"I get the feeling that there's a bit of backlash about this book, that people think the author is ridiculous and maybe slightly crazy and has completely unreasonable ideas about how people should live.But I thought it was charming! For one thing, I LOVE reading about organizing things (and I actually love doing it, once I get around to it). As soon as I started reading this, all I wanted to do was go home and throw things away. I also love her way of anthropomorphizing inanimate objects, which is definitely more of a thing in Japanese culture and fits in with the Shinto religion where there are little spirits in every rock and tree and waterfall and so on. Why not also in your socks or your books? And why not thank your shoes every day for all their hard work? I think she's right that if you think of your belongings as sort of alive, you will take better care of them.Last, I want to particularly mention Cathy Hirano's translation. It's just perfect and lovely. "
87,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13396599-niki-hawkes---the-obsessive-bookseller,Rating 4 out of 5,"[3.5 stars] I have been an organizer all of my adult life, even going so far as to lists “organizing” as my strongest asset on job applications (as it turns out, all the jobs I’ve ever had have been optimal organizing jobs). 2017 is my year of Simplifying Life, which involves, you guessed it, organizing every aspect. So, when my library flashed an available copy of The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up in front of my face, I snagged it… Serendipity? I think so.This book was fun for a couple of reasons. One of which was that it allowed me to compare my organizing skill set against a professional. I’m delighted to report that I actually came away from it with several new great ideas and a whole new perspective on how to get rid of stuff. The book is packed with many great tips along with an interesting look into how the author developed the KonMari method over the years. Also – it was amazing to finally find someone who can talk about organizing and getting rid of stuff without advocating minimalism! I love stuff. I love MY stuff. I just don’t want to be buried under it.One of the best things Marie Kondo does is present her method with a clear order of operations for tidying (she uses the word “tidy” in the same way I would talk about organizing and getting rid of stuff). The idea is to ease you into the process by starting out with things that are easier to get rid of. #1 was clothing. This is already a revolution for me, because when I go through my stuff, I tend to always begin with keepsakes – the most difficult things to part with. Anyway, her method involves gathering every like-item of each category in one place. It’s important that you don’t worry about organizing until you’re done sorting items into either keep” or “discard”. One point of contention I’d like to briefly note here is that she advocates throwing things away, whereas I’m more inclined to donate. She does bring up donation as an option, but more often than not describes throwing away dozens and dozens of bags of items).Her method hinges on 1. using your ability to identify which items bring you joy and 2. your willingness to get rid of everything that doesn’t. This is the part I found most helpful. You see, most other methods I’ve researched advocate identifying which items to discard. Whether it be “get rid of 1000 items over the next year” or “find one item a day to get rid of”. They put more emphasis on quantity over quality that IMO focuses on the negatives. Marie Kondo changed my perspective by conveying that what’s important is not what you discard, but what you choose to keep. With the other methods, it gets to a point where you’re hounding your house, looking for things to discard (I can attest that it can get really frustrating). Kondo has her clients physically touch every item and spend a moment considering whether or not it sparks joy. While her and I don’t agree on every point within her method, this one at least was a home run.Speaking of not agreeing, the next category after clothing is books… Kondo is of the philosophy that if you buy a book and don’t read it right away, chances are you’ll never get around to reading it and it needs to go. The intention to read a book is not a good enough reason to keep it. BLASPHEMY! Now, I admit I get where she’s coming from, but I think this only applies to the average person and not us book-obsessed. Arguably, books are my life, and when you devour 60+ books a year, there’s a good chance you actually will get to a lot of the titles on your shelves (eventually).But it got me thinking…What if getting rid of the books you intend to read in favor of keeping just the books you are excited to read would actually make you feel lighter and more free? On one hand, being surrounded by books is one of my biggest joys in life, but (as any book lever can relate, that looming TBR can cause a ton of stress. I always enjoy what I’m reading, but much less when I’m focused on getting through my current reads because I’m impatient to get to my to-reads.About five years ago, I had over 4000 books in my house. I don’t remember the exact numbers for the math I did, but at the current rate I was reading, it would’ve taken me over 40 years to get through all of them. Add to that all of the upcoming new releases and all of the hundreds of books on my Goodreads TBR that I have yet to purchase, and we have a problem. Let me repeat: 40 YEARS! How’s that for stressful? So I downsized, getting rid of everything I found only mildly interesting and only keeping the books I thought I’d pay attention to within the next 10 years. As I sit here thinking about all of my favorite books buried underneath mediocre TBR books, I can’t help but think that thinning it out yet once more might not be a bad idea. I definitely don’t condone throwing out most of your books if, like me, reading is your number one joy in life, but I can definitely see the benefit of making your collection something to be proud of. Her method definitely needs some tweaking for us bookish people, and I’ll probably develop some method of my own and talk more about it in my Simplifying Life: Books post coming this fall. Moving on…Here are some other interesting ideas from this book:Keepsakes: Kondo suggests going through keepsakes last. That way, you have a good handle and lots of practice using the KonMari method, and can more easily identify which things merit hanging onto. She claims that most keepsakes you don’t actually need to keep because the memories associated with them is already so strong, you won’t forget them after discarding the items. Thinking about my own keepsakes, I can definitely see how this is true – tossing that pile of rocks I have sitting on my shelf from my trip to Wyoming is probably not going to diminish my memory of the trip itself. This will be the hardest category for me because I’m incredibly sentimental about inanimate objects. I learned long ago that if I hold onto it for more than a month, that sucker ain’t ever leaving my house, no matter how trivial it is.Papers: this is one of the categories I disagreed with Kondo about. She says, aside from a few documents you have to keep like birth certificates and car titles, everything else can be disposed of. I don’t know if it’s a cultural difference, but this woman has clearly never been through underwriting while buying a house in the US. Those people require EVERYTHING. Kondo’s claim is that whatever you discard, you can always get ahold of again if you need it. When disputing charges on my Century Link bill, however, and there bill access section is conveniently not working, that’s when I wish I had a printout of them stashed away. I will admit that the vast majority of papers we hang on to our unnecessary, but for me, the ones I choose to keep are there for convenience and to alleviate possible stress later. It seems like anymore these days the less documentation you have to back you up, the more people screw you over. Or maybe that’s just me. That said, I still only have a small 2-drawer filing cabinet (hot pink, of course) for everything.Gifts: Kondo does a really great job trying to make you feel less guilty about getting rid of things you received as gifts. We all have them. And we hang on to a lot of them because we’re afraid it would hurt the person’s feelings if we got rid of them. I’m really horrible about this. My mom once gave me a bunch of socks she didn’t like, and I hung on to them for a couple of years before finally asking her if it was okay if I got rid of them. If it comes from my mommy or my husband, it’s really difficult for me to let go, even if I don’t like it. That said, when I do finally let some things go, I feel lighter somehow. Kondo’s argument is that the purpose of the gift was to make you feel appreciated by the gift giver. The item has already served its purpose, and what happens to it after that is the less important factor. I agree completely with that sentiment, and I certainly hope any gifts I’ve given weren’t held onto because of guilt. That said, just don’t let me know that you got rid of it – I gave my grandma a bird statue for her birthday one year and saw it sitting proudly on the table at her following garage sale a couple months later… Ouch.Stocking up: People buy in bulk and stock up on all sorts of things, and Kondo thinks this is most often unnecessary. Her argument is, by the time you make it through your items, most of them have past their expiration date and have to be discarded, anyway. It’s a much more intelligent use of time money and space to only buy the items as you need them. As I sit here staring at the six boxes of expired peppermint tea that I’ve been buying over the last few years every time I got a coupon, I can totally see her point. I’m going to throw away a ton of tea that I bought on sale, which means I essentially wasted $20 rather than “benefiting” from a savings of $3. There are a few exceptions, but generally, I find her argument to be valid.Humanizing Items: this is the final thing I didn’t quite see eye to eye with the author on. She says to treat each item like a person (that’s not exactly as she said it, but you get the gist). When you get home from the day and take off your shoes, you’re supposed to thank them for keeping your feet comfy throughout the day. When you get rid of a shirt, you’re supposed to send it off with the thank you for keeping you clothed all those years. I have a couple of issues with this (aside from the obvious). Primarily that doing something like this for every item in your house requires so much energy. I spend most of my day putting on a polite, friendly demeanor for coworkers and tenants, the last thing I want to do when I get to my home – a place where I can let that face down and just exist in peace – is have to treat inanimate objects like they’re people. The more minor issue is that, if I treat my things like people, I’ll never be able to get rid of them without feeling guilty, lol.To round out the KonMari method, once you have gone through everything in your house and decided what to keep, only then do you start the organization process. The key is making sure everything has a “home.” Right now I have lots of stuff in my house that doesn’t really go anywhere, so it ends up on counters, in cars, and shoved into random drawers. If you give everything a place, then the maintenance of this stuff won’t make you want to peel your face off (that last sentiment is mine, not the author’s).Overall, as this is one of my first forays into nonfiction (don’t worry, it will be one of my only), I found it highly interesting. The Obsessive Bookseller definitely wants to get her life organized this year, and every little tip helps! I am chomping at the bit to start applying some of the methods I’ve acquired from Kondo to see if they really work, which I’ll definitely highlight it in future Simplifying Life posts (once my house is finished being built and I can dig into all my stuff – currently in storage). In any case, thanks for coming along with me on this organization tangent – I hope you picked up some tips LOL.Via The Obsessive Bookseller at a href=""https://nikihawkes.com/"">www.... "
88,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3917029-stacia,Rating 3 out of 5,"I think I read decluttering books like others read recipe books. Lol. (Probably because my extended family has pack-rats bordering on hoarders & I'm constantly trying to understand & also make sure any genetic predisposition does not take effect in my case.)For Americans, it's probably a misleading title to use 'tidying' because I think most Americans will think of it as a cleaning how-to book. It's not. She's like the Japanese super-nanny (nice but really, really firm in her convictions [or orders] about how you need to deal with your stuff) come to call, promoting a radical change in the amount of your stuff. Her book differs from the traditional ones I've read in a couple of different ways...-- Most decluttering books focus on removing items you don't want, sometimes working quickly, other times working at a slow & steady pace. Kondo's method is to keep what you love (what ""sparks joy"") & then get rid of anything that remains. And, she says to do it thoroughly, all at one time (about 6 months total for a whole house) & then never need to do it again.-- There is a strong animist outlook in here with much said about appreciating & thanking your possessions (even those that will be leaving your home). I personally like this idea, but I can see that some Westerners may dismiss some of her advice because of a strong animism component.-- Rather than sorting by room or area, she demands that you sort by type of article -- so, basically, gather all your clothes in one place first, then pick up each one separately, see how it feels/speaks to you; if it sparks joy, you keep it; if not, you thank it for the work or lesson it gave you & release it to go somewhere else. She has a specific order for going through the belongings in your home ranging from those that will be less emotional (clothing) until you get to the hard stuff/more emotional (personal mementos such as letters & photos).-- Her advice seems to stem from a single-person POV or perhaps a couple, but not really addressing families. So, there are holes about dealing with things like toys, necessary garage/yard items, etc... That said, if you truly tackled the areas she listed & were ruthless per her standards, you could make a big difference in those areas, which might spur you to continue on those other areas, imo.-- Her take on papers/paperwork in general is that papers pretty much never ""spark joy"", so get rid of them (unless absolutely essential). Lol! Personally, I agree & that's an area where I need to improve. I have tons of papers I could dump.So, for me, it was a fun & somewhat inspiring read. Not sure that most who read it are to the point of radical decluttering/simplifying that she promotes, but perhaps it is enough to spur you into action? If you google her name &/or articles about her, you will be able to read some overviews of her style & outlook.FYI, if you (or others in your home) are the type to travel down memory lane with each & every possession, I'm not sure how well the ""spark joy"" criteria would work. My guess is memory lane folks will feel like everything sparks joy &, therefore, not let go of anything. (Just my guess based on my own relatives who love traveling down memory lane with every possession.)If you're looking for a kinder/gentler approach to decluttering (maybe one that might work more w/ the 'memory lane' folks), you may want to see if your library or bookstore carries Clutter Busting: Letting Go of What's Holding You Back by Brooks Palmer. He goes much more into addressing why/how people collect clutter & how to gently change the mindset. Imo, his outlook would be more likely to work for the memory lane types, while Marie Kondo's book is going to appeal more to those who want to embrace radical change or already appreciate minimalism to a certain extent."

90,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8858013-julia,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book was seriously life-changing for me. It forced me to think differently about my home and my possessions. I don't think I even realized before what I thought about the things that owned or really, truly why I owned them. I just did and something had to be done with them. I have spent countless hours trying to keep-up a house that was overflowing with things that felt heavy and tedious. This book taught me that everything in your life should have a purpose. If it's in your home, your space, it should be because it brings joy to your life. I never really thought about how all the unread books, unused clothing or toiletries were affecting my ability to concentrate and spend my time on the things that do truly make me happy. I am slowly applying these methods and in the spaces I have, feel infinitely lighter. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a way to clear up their life and space so that they can focus on what's truly important to them. If you're not quite ready to take a drastic leap, maybe save this one for later."

As one who feels pity for the long-forgotten single sock in the back of the drawer, I could relate to the need to tidy in order to bring items in the household to their full potential. I loved that this book didn't advocate any type of new storage system and as someone who loves deleting things off her computer, I really enjoyed the simple principle of ""Discard first, Store later"" that is at the heart of this book.While many may find Kondo's method drastic, her promise of having to tidy up only once in a lifetime really spoke to me. The idea that's highlighted in this book and that she teaches in her consulting business, is that you go through specific categories of items group by group, put them all in a pile, physically touch every object and if it brings you joy, keep it, if not, throw it away or donate it. The act of touching and handling the object opens you up to dialog with it so that you can truly decide if you want it in your life. Yes, it seems like a hassle to handle every single sock and decide if it brings you joy or not, but shouldn't we value our stuff enough to take that time?I would have given this book 5 stars, but like other reviewers said, some parts got repetitive and this could have been a much shorter book. It's also mostly catered to people living on their own. It didn't offer much advice about what to do if you want to tidy up in the Mari-Kon way, but your husband does not. She did include anecdotes about how she used to throw away her family members' forgotten items, but I'm not sure that is a long term solution in my household."

97,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5858699-kavita,Rating 2 out of 5,"I am not sure whether it was this book or this episode of Wagle ki Duniya (sorry, no subs) that motivated me to clean up, but I am now in the middle of the process. As someone with mild claustrophobia and a tiny flat in Mumbai, I don't really hoard things. I regularly declutter and give away or throw out things I no longer use. I am pretty minimalist myself. But this author is something else. I really didn't gain much from her.Clothes - Kondo does have some good ideas for dealing with clothes. Basically, if you no longer fit into the outfit or it has become worn, give it away. That said, she claims that the average person has 160 items of upper clothing (sweaters, shirts, blouses, etc.), and she makes them discard one third of it. I don't have 53 items of upper clothing in the first place! It's just way too much for one single person. I am obviously not an ""average"" person. She waxes lyrical about her socks and stockings and has ideas on how to fold them . I own about two pairs of socks and zero stockings. I don't even know what I would do with stockings! I own sweaters but they are stored at my parents' place. Obviously, a big no-no with Kondo. Books - The average number of books you should have is 30. That's just laughable. If I only had 30 books, I would be depressed, irrespective of how clean and tidy my home looked. Her method of dealing with books is to just throw everything out except a few classics. For books from which she wants to keep only a few words (why would anyone want that?!), she recommends tearing out the pages and throwing the rest of it away. This made me feel nauseous and extremely angry. And this woman talks to her clothes because she thinks they have feelings! She has no respect for books and I have no respect for someone like that. She seems to think that books are only there for information and once you have read it, you have the information, so throw it out. How stupid can you possibly get? According to her, you are never going to read books that are on your bookshelf and have not been read for two years. She has NO idea what the hell she is talking about. I read a book last year that I bought in 2009 and am currently reading a book I received as a present 4 years ago. I am sorry, but this woman is barbaric and foolish. Documents - Here, we really step on to dangerous territory. She recommends throwing away all your bank and credit card statements, manuals of electronic items, and pretty much all the papers you own. Don't do this. I hate papers cluttering up everywhere myself, but I am SO not going to throw everything away. Photographs - Throw everything away. Nope. Not happening. I have photographs from my dad's childhood and I treasure them. I also have his stamp collection and those are not going either. She commiserates someone's grandfather whose photos her client showed her and thinks they would have had a richer life if they had only thrown away the photographs. Nope. YOU are the one with the sad life, Kondo!She also wants you to throw away your extra bedding if you only receive guests once or twice a year. So where will my family who visit yearly and the occasional friend who visits me sleep when they come over? I ask people to bring their own bedding? I also think that Kondo comes from a position of huge financial privilege. I am NOT going to throw things away just because I don't need it right now. I have rolls of scotch tape that are only useful to me when I move. But I don't plan to throw them out and buy more when I need them. It's a ridiculous waste of money. She recommends this approach with pretty much anything, never stopping to think that some people might not want to throw away their useful stuff for ""tidying"". It's fine to keep tools and papers and toilet paper for long term use even if you don't use it for two years. Anyone who claims the contrary is not thinking right or has too much money and time to waste on tidying.Kondo is obviously suffering from some form of OCD and needs help badly. Which teenager spends all their spare time tidying up when they could be playing, checking out the boys, or even studying? I can't really take much of what she says seriously. She also appears to think that all women must wear nice things all the time. Nope. I found this attitude quite sexist as she recommends throwing away all lounge wear that don't look attractive. She doesn't mention the same for men. The book has a tone that appears to be mostly addressing women as if tidying up is solely our business. Nope. I don't think the author gets that even if we want to declutter, we aren't obsessed with throwing stuff away. Finally, the one place where I wouldn't mind some help is the kitchen, but Kondo barely addresses this except for a few words about storing spices in shoe boxes. I am Indian. I am not going to put my footwear packaging and food together. I did like her idea about keeping things that make you happy or that are useful. But she is way too brutal about it. The writing is repetitive and unintentionally quite funny if you like reading about people inhabiting cuckooland. If you are a hoarder with genuine problems, then perhaps this book can help, but I don't see it being of much help to most people. So no, not throwing my books away and definitely not going to mutilate them! *shudders*"
98,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/652877-flannery,Rating 4 out of 5,"Update: I have now listened to this book like 10 times. I don't really even listen to it, it's just on in the background while I work. But it did work for me. I got rid of a seriously huge amount of stuff, stopped buying more crap (or if I do, I go through my current stuff to make sure I have the space and only things I like-ish), stopped accepting free gifts like work-branded mouse pads and pens and I fold like a weirdo now. And you know what? I have no regrets. I can open my drawers and see every piece of clothing I own. I can open my closet and it is totally organized. I keep similar items together so I know what I have. I even donated hundreds of books and continue to cull my collection. ___________________________________________________________Before I start talking about this, just know that I haven't ""tidied"" anything at all since I finished listening to this book today. I am basing my review purely on my listening experience. So here goes. I work with data, videos and words all day long. Just recently (read: yesterday) I thought I'd take a break from my normal audio choices and see if I could listen to an audiobook while I work. Usually I listen to ambient noises like wind chimes, ocean noises, rain, etc. or I listen to classical music or a mostly Simon and Garfunkel, The National, Nickel Creek-esque type of playlist. How did my experiment go? Well, if this book is any indication, it went swell. The woman who reads this book is kind of monotone but in the perfect way. Kondo is so no-nonsense in her approach that I felt that the narration was apt--I mean, I am not someone who was even really interested in tidying up my house or my life; I was just kind of interested because of the massive popularity of this book. After reading it, though, I truly want to go through all of my belongings. I could envision my closet looking like something I'd enjoy looking at instead of just piles and piles of clothes. And here's the thing: Some of the points seem in-your-face obvious, but I guess I just never thought about them in her particular way. Sometimes, I go through my clothes and pick out a garbage bag or two for donations. Afterward, I fold the remaining stuff and put them in drawers and in my closet. Kondo makes a point to talk about how cleaning and getting rid of stuff is not particularly about quantity. She will never tell people they have to get rid of anything. It's about quality, and I may be just another lemming here, but I can totally see her point. My closet is seriously full to the brim. Is it organized? Yeah, I guess. Do I have too much stuff? Definitely. But the important question is this: How does it make me feel when I open my closet doors? Barf. It makes me feel annoyed and disappointed. I don't like looking at it. Kondo recommends folding things and putting them away vertically so that you can always see a portion of everything that is in your drawers. (or in your anything, really) When I listened to the chapter about folding things, I was like, ""Huh. That seems so obvious. WTF is wrong with all of us?"" I'm definitely going to try it. She even kind of got me on board to tackle my (literally over 1,000) books. Besides books and clothes, I don't have too much stuff. According to her, though, and I tend to agree, we all have more than we think. I'm certain I'll have many garbage bags full of stuff when I'm done ""tidying up my home."" I'm not religious and I've never really been interested in anything self-helpy or filled with affirmations, but I'm beginning to see why people like these kinds of books. The author beats to death the fact that none of her clients have had relapses. Everyone is happier, every house is tidier and ""none of my clients have every complained to me about x or y."" I kept imagining a Japanese woman, about one foot away from your face, telling you through gritted teeth that none of her clients have ever had a problem with any of her methods...if you know what I mean...*runs finger across her throat.* In that respect, it kind of worked on me. If everyone else can do it and allegedly never have any problems with her methods later on, why the heck can't I?"

Preface added 24 March 2024Marie Kondo is an author whose works should not be permitted anywhere near Goodreads, because Goodreads is full of people who regard books as sacred, collect them with little or no regard for the several lifetimes it will take to read them, the space required to house them, the dangers to health from dust, vermin infestations and the inevitable accidents caused by straining to reach a tome on a high shelf and perhaps worst of all, separating them into two separate piles when divorcing:  ‘You keep it!’‘But I gave it to you for our tenth anniversary.’ ‘Well, I don’t want it anymore!’ And yet…two things happen with Ms Kondo, one regular, the other less common but still significant. The first thing is highly readable reviews. We agree that Ms Kondo’s method for decluttering books is barbaric – throw them on the floor, save the ones that spark joy and get rid of the rest. She even suggests ripping out a few pages that contain significant words you might want to keep (I’ll just flick through Anna Karenina for some choice phrases about Vronsky on a horse). Inhuman. This prescription precipitates dyspeptic, vitriolic reviews which are, however, vastly entertaining. They make very good reading. I’m sure you can find them. So perhaps she should stay.The less common reaction is a pragmatic teeth-gritting acknowledgement that she might be onto something and perhaps we should just try it.I have had a number of goes. I have had some success with my adapted version of her method. While she says put all your books on the floor then select the 'spark joy' ones, I recently carefully placed 500+ of our fiction titles on the dining table, then put back the ones I really wanted. There were 129 left on the table. My wife then salvaged 20 of those leaving 109, which I then distributed among local street libraries. I have to do this otherwise I will need to live much longer than I intend, to read all those I have. Which brings up another point. How many of you, like me, have a TBR which far exceeds the number you have already read? I am trying to get the TBR below the number I have read. Hard work. I should explain that the TBR contains a great many books which are in my house. So it is a genuine problem. I am 68 now and if I approach them at my present rate I will need to live to about 150. This is optimistic. By all means if you are going make 150, keep your TBR as it is, but I must go now and put some more books on the dining table. PS: Ms Kondo’s advice works brilliantly for clothes especially what she says about folding. And similarly for tools, papers and kitchen gear, just not so well for books."

Si, volevo vedere quali metodi assurdi avrebbe cercato di vendermi solo che non ho riso parecchio, sono rimasta sbigottita ma non in positivo. Cominciamo col dire che le cose ""sensate"" non sono niente di nuovo, insomma non ha scoperto l'acqua calda Marie Kondo quindi non capisco perché questo libro è diventato best seller visto che è farcito di cose che tutti sanno. Lo so anche io che per tenere una casa pulita basta buttare via tutto, una volta che la casa è vuota allora è pulita per forza! (Si, perché la scrittrice poi riassume il suo ordine con lei seduta in camera da letto mentre guarda il suo quadro e il vaso di fiori... e basta. wow, invidiabile insomma). Ma quello non è riordinare, piuttosto lo sono i metodi di catalogatura che lei tanto disprezza (e che io non saprei seguire, su cui magari varrebbe la pena scrivere un libro piuttosto che su ""buttate tutto, TUTTO!!"").Prima di tutto la scrittrice ha un attaccamento ai ricordi pari a zero, arriva addirittura a buttare foto come fossero banalissimi oggetti (al massimo gli riconosce un valore 'rarità' ma non un attaccamento ai ricordi). Riconosce che si, sarebbe meglio buttare foto e ricordi per ultimi perché potrebbero farci perdere tempo e distrarci, ma basta. Insomma, come ho detto attaccamento emotivo zero (sarà un mondo alieno per me, ma davvero chi butta le fotografie!?)Oltretutto mi resta difficile farmi insegnare qualche cosa da una persona che è palesemente maniaca convulsiva.Si, perché da piccola invece che giocare con i compagni riordinava la classe. Ok, ognuno ha il suo no? Si, ma sempre da piccola tornava da scuola e passava tutto il pomeriggio a pulire casa senza nemmeno fare in tempo a cambiarsi. OK, sempre molto strano ma dai passabile. Prima di un esame non studiava (c'è da chiedersi come sia finita a scrivere un libro) ma passava fino alle due di notte a pulire. Ok, sta diventando problematica ma fine così no? No invece perché buttava via le cose degli altri che secondo lei erano di troppo e considerava la cosa come un favore che lei faceva alla famiglia. Ok, questo non va bene per niente. Oltre al fatto di parlare con gli oggetti mi sembra assurdo, non una cosa zen ma proprio una cosa assurda.Marie Kondo poi rende tutto incredibilmente facile, tipo: per pulire casa basta una volta sola nella vita, così almeno promette poi però precisa che ci metterete circa sei mesi. Sei mesi?! Si, ma oltretutto non potete prendervela con calma ma dovete fare il più in fretta possibile. Perché se prendete tutto con calma sparisce la magia, quale magia non mi è ben chiaro il succo è che dovete pulire non stop e mi chiedo chi diavolo abbia il tempo per farlo (lei sicuramente, però nessun altro). Oltretutto non riesco a prendere sul serio una persona che butta via tutto quello che ritiene non necessario, e tra questo non necessario ci sono (ad esempio) i libri. Si, perché secondo il suo punto di vista un libro letto va buttato perché ""inutile"", e circondarsi di libri non è una bella cosa e non dovrebbe rendere felici nessuno. Qui non sono per niente d'accordo, casomai non si fosse capito. Vivo circondata di libri in casa mia: libri che ho letto, libri che ha letto qualcun altro in famiglia ma io non ho mai toccato (non ho interesse di leggere ora, ma in futuro chi lo sa?), libri di quando i miei genitori erano bambini, prime edizioni di libri ormai introvabili, ecc. dovrei buttarli perché ""non servono a niente""? è follia.Lei non ha palesemente niente da fare e scommetto non ha famiglia perché pensa solo a sé stessa. Oltre al fatto di buttare cose quando viveva con i genitori (cosa che io le avrei fatto pagare a suon di calci) è evidente il suo egoismo. Una persona che butta via un libro dopo averlo letto non considera neanche che magari qualcun altro in famiglia potrebbe volerlo leggere dopo. Lei precisa proprio di buttare via i propri oggetti appunto senza farli vedere al resto della famiglia perché potrebbero imedirvi di buttarli, udite udite, chiedendovi piuttosto di regalarli a loro! SI, perché è una cosa gravissima insomma. Come osa un membro della famiglia chiedervi se dato che buttate via quella borsa piuttosto la date a lei? Insomma, indecente no? Io trovo indecente il suo ragionamento ma punti di vista. La sua massima concessione è chiedere ai membri della famiglia se serve loro qualche cosa, e loro devono rispondervi in maniera specifica così da mostrargli solo quello che vi hanno chiesto. Tipo ""mamma ti serve qualche cosa?"" ""mah, non saprei..."" e dato che voi state buttando tipo solo vestiti anni 50 non gli mostrate niente, ovviamente. Mah!Esilarante il divieto di non usare vestiti vecchi per stare in casa, altrimenti diventerete persone da vestiti vecchi! Capito? se avete messo la tuta in casa donne (tranquilli uomini, questo è un discorso ovviamente dedicato solo al gentil sesso perché fa sempre piacere un po' di sessimo da donna a donna, grazie Marie!) ormai non potete più uscirne. Siete donne da tuta (io ho la tuta in questo momento mentre scrivo questa recensione, quindi è la fine per me) anche se quando uscite metterete tacchi e gonna ormai si noterà che siete... donne da tuta!E qui chiudo.(Davvero, leggete questo libro solo per ridere)"
103,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2344791-ashleytia,Rating 3 out of 5,"Monday was a planned ""deep clean"" day at my house, so I decided to download the audiobook version of The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up for a little extra motivation. The whole time I was listening to it I was planning out my review. I couldn't wait to tell you how ridiculous I found it - the idea that inanimate objects have feelings and should be spoken to. When the author first mentioned that socks should not be balled up in a drawer at the end of the day because they need space to relax after protecting your precious feet, I thought it was a joke. She goes on to say that she praises her clothes for a job well done as she removes them each evening, and has her clients thank each item before tossing it in the trash or donate pile (""thank you for the years of use"" or ""thank you for the joy you brought to me when I purchased you."")I can't stop thinking about it, though. I enjoy shopping and style, but I don't always treat my clothes well - tossing them over a chair instead of folding, throwing them in the laundry machine when I know they should be hand-washed. I think if I had the mindset that my clothing items have feelings I might take better care of them and appreciate them for longer. So while this book has some unusual ideas, I think it's worth the read. My main takeaway was the author's admonition to hold each item you own in your hands and ask yourself if it brings you joy. To live in a home surrounded by only things that speak to me sounds wonderful. I might even try greeting my house out loud when I get home from work, but I can assure you that I won't be unloading my purse each night to give it a chance to decompress - too far for me even when I'm trying to have an open mind. ; ) "

Do you really think they can get any rest like that?” That’s right. The socks and stockings stored in your drawer are essentially on holiday. They take a brutal beating in their daily work, trapped between your foot and your shoe, enduring pressure and friction to protect your precious feet. The time they spend in your drawer is their only chance to rest. But if they are folded over, balled up, or tied, they are always in a state of tension, their fabric stretched and their elastic pulled. They roll about and bump into each other every time the drawer is opened and closed. Any socks and stockings unfortunate enough to get pushed to the back of the drawer are often forgotten for so long that their elastic stretches beyond recovery.” "

OK, I don't read these books for myself because I am already pretty tidy, except that there are some older articles of clothing I refuse to get rid of in hopes they'll someday come back into style. I already tried using shoe boxes for drawer dividers as suggested, but found you can actually cram much more crap in your drawers without them. I am a firm believer in ""A place for everything and everything in its place, "" which is why I never run around before leaving the house looking for my keys. They're in my purse, where they belong. But if I followed Kondo's advice, I would have emptied my purse the night before so it could rest -- and then where would my keys be, not to mention my gum, wallet, 5 favorite pens, purse-size kleenex dispenser, etc.? Is it more important for the purse to de-stress overnight, or for me to skip that crap in order to avoid stress in the morning? But no, I read books like this hoping that there might be ideas about how to handle living with someone who never wants to throw anything away. Unfortunately, there wasn't much on that here. Her suggestion to hide things you think should be tossed to see if their absence is ever noticed is something I, of course, already do. The absence of 3-4 holey t-shirts once in a while seems to go unnoticed -- hurray for small victories -- but throwing out 3-4 garbage bags of t-shirts is sure to be grounds for divorce, right? And throwing away multiple boxes of books is not something I'd even attempt. Also, as is the author's habit, I don't think I could ever get used to talking to my shoes or other possessions (thanking them for their good service each night; greeting them with a cheery hello in the morning).So I don't know what impact this is going to have on my life. When I told my husband what I was reading, he said, ""Oh-oh, sounds dangerous."" When I told him that you are to keep only items that bring you joy, he said that applies to everything he owns. Go figure."

The practical information is somewhat useful, if not particularly revolutionary (but I have read prior books on minimalism). However, I was so turned off by the talk of your home and belongings having energies and emotions of their own (ex. unworn clothing ""feels"" neglected, coins left all over your home feel sad and depressed that they're not living up to its potential as money, how you should praise your clothes/home for a job well done, etc). I also found some of her approaches to cause far MORE hassle, like unpacking every item from your purse and storing your purse in a bag in your closet EVERY DAY when you get home. That just seems removed from any practical reality. Also, it bugged me that she bragged about the number of trash bags people threw away without at least mentioning how to reduce your environmental impact when reducing your belongings. And there was no discussion of how to examine your purchasing behavior to avoid accumulating MORE stuff in the future. I sort of feel like that's a missing piece to her philosophy of tidiness.However, at the end of it all, I am still eager to clean out my house and took away some tips, especially about the order of going through your belongings and only keeping the items that you truly enjoy, and to take care of said items. That's really the point of it all.It may be worth skimming for some people, but if you Google for articles about the book/author, you'll find practically the same information that's in the book."

If you have a bunch of junk in your house or are holding on to things that you need to let go: read this book. I read this book after I had already done a pretty sizeable purge and reorganizion before/after a move, but I still appreciate it's message and can see myself taking my spring break to go through and de-clutter my life so I can truly be tidy and give every thing a place and purpose in my life. However, these are my two big issues with this book (and what I'm for seeing to be my issue with the Netflix series):✨She is quirky. Really quirky. I know most of it is rooted in her belief that all things give life and are alive etc. But I just can't get on board with that idea and so when she was telling me that my socks needed sometime to rest and to tell them they did a good job, I just found myself rolling my eyes. ✨ The nitty-gritty application portion just felt redundant to me after all she had already walked through.

Still this book provides the moral courage needed to discard things, lots and lots of things. The second half was far less helpful and even discouraging, also very weird.

Kondo is a little kooky (I think even she might admit that), and definitely obsessed with tidyness, but she had some really great ideas and I just want to put them into practice RIGHT NOW. I read a variety of feng shui/organization/decluttering books/websites regularly, but she said things I hadn't seen before.1. Don't do a little at a time. Do it all at once (even if it takes 6 months, don't repeat yourself).2. DON'T SORT BY AREA. Sort by category. Not ""the kitchen, the master closet, the bathroom"", but clothes, shoes, books, kitchen stuff, miscellany (she has an order...I'm pretty close with this list). 3. Take out EVERYTHING in a category, pile it on the floor, and TOUCH IT. Touch everything. Touch it and see how it makes you feel. She made an interesting distinction between throwing things away and deciding what to keep. The latter is much more positive. So when deciding what to keep, touch it and see what emotional reaction you have to it. If it's not joy (or exist for sheer purpose, like your car title), get rid of it. That seems so obvious, but I have held on to books (she says this is normal) for years because I think I'll read them, but in my heart I don't really care about them that much. Or clothes (and I'm wearing a sweater as we speak) that make me self-conscious because they either don't fit right, or I SHOULD like them but I don't, or I paid a lot of money for them, etc. I have a pair of black heels that I dread putting on because they always slip off my feet. Always! They need to go!Kondo believes that once you do this entire process, you won't have to do it again. You'll KNOW what speaks to you and what you really want to own. You'll appreciate what you have because everything you own is exactly perfect and not too much. And you won't shop/purchase mindlessly because you won't really want to. You'll be more aware of how you really feel about something and whether it belongs in your home or not. And best of all, everything will have a place to go because you put it there consciously. She also believes that things want to be useful, to be used. If you're not using something, it's not living out its purpose, so give it away to someone else. Or maybe it's already lived out its purpose (a greeting card, a broken coffee machine), so let it go. Not everything is meant forever--just like people. And you can't do this for others, just yourself because everything is personal to you. I don't know, it just moved me. Your stuff is a composite of your life, and says things about you. I think my life will be quite transitional this year...do I want to haul things around to new places that I don't even like? Do I want to merge with someone else's stuff when some of mine doesn't matter to me? No! I want to feel joy from my things. I really want to get started...I just need a little time to do so!"

Non riuscivo a credere che si potesse scrivere un manuale semplicemente per imparare a riordinare la casa.Avevo ragione; il libro più che altro è un manuale di psicologia, che insegna a fare ordine nella propria vita. Il nostro modo di scegliere, gestire e ordinare oggetti, libri, vestiti e affini è quasi sempre rappresentativo del nostro modo di vivere.Per questo la Kondo sostiene che mettendo ordine nelle nostre cose, alla fine mettiamo ordine nella nostra vita.""Quello che dovremmo scegliere non è che cosa buttare, ma che cosa conservare.""Il metodo si basa sostanzialmente su un unico concetto:""Conservate le cose che vi evocano una qualche emozione e buttate via le altre.""Vale per tutto: vestiti, scarpe, dischi, libri, pentole, detersivi, deodoranti, soprammobili, manuali di istruzione, fotografie e, perché no, mogli e mariti (sembra che una coppia di clienti della Kondo abbia divorziato dopo il corso, visto che di emozioni non ce n'erano più).Appare spesso esagerata e maniacale, la Kondo. E abbastanza ripetitiva. A volte pure un po' fuori di testa. Ma credo che il suo metodo funzioni, a patto di volersi seriamente cimentare.""Non bisogna prendere l’abitudine di riordinare un po’ alla volta, ma è importante mettere a posto una volta per tutte, perché solo così il vostro modo di pensare cambierà drasticamente. Sperimenterete un cambiamento talmente radicale che toccherà le vostre emozioni. Con un simile impatto, volenti o nolenti, cambierete radicalmente la vostra mentalità e le vostre abitudini quotidiane.""Ordine e disordine non sono altro che approcci mentali. Non credo sia difficile concordare sul fatto che sia meglio concentrarsi su ciò che emoziona e piace piuttosto che disperdere l'attenzione sul superfluo.E' un concetto ovvio e banale? Meno di quanto non si creda, secondo me! (PS: Ho spiegato il contenuto del libro in famiglia e mi sono ritrovato in un cassonetto dell'immondizia di fronte casa...) "

Who wants to? Oh....you? Well, then this book is for you.There's definitely stuff to take and leave from this weird, quickly-read book for people less obsessed with the topic.1. Folding your clothes and filing them instead of stacking them: the author purports this is to give your clothes a break from gravity, to thank them for their hard work. Ooookay. Actual reason to do this: suddenly you have 3x the drawer space, and can remove something from your drawers without messing the whole thing up. REVOLUTIONARY.2. Do as much decluttering as you can all at once. The sense of reward is empowering.3. Evaluating if your belongings makes you happy (or ""sparks joy"" as the phrase is cloyingly repeated) is actually a great way to curate a home that is more *you*4. I actually think she's onto something when she talks about how loneliness growing up encourages us to form attachments to objects. In my experience, introverts = interesting, clutter-filled homes.I wish there wasn't all the ""you'll lose weight! you'll get the job promotion!"" crap in this book. Empty promises for people with no texture to their lives. How about, we live in our houses every day and deserve for them to be places that make us feel comfortable and happy?

Tips like collecting all the same stuff in one place and really physically grasping how much you have (on average 160 pieces of clothing she states) and using the happiness an object gives you as a norm to keep or toss it are easy to understand and to follow on a conceptual level. Also the link she makes between tidying and having the feeling of control on your life, and the perspective that not using an item is also wasteful, were good to reflect upon.What I found less positive when reading the book was the magical thinking that every object has a kind of soul and a purpose, and the occasional rather dated observations Kondo seems to have in respect to feminity. Also she strikes me as a bit obsessed from the glances she offers of her youth, which doesn’t reduce the barrier to actually use her method in real life if you think of yourself as not such a structured person. But overall a positive reading experience and a book which gave me a positive vibe to start tidying!Disclaimer: I am book lover/hoarder, so I elect to fully ignore the advice of Mari Kondo in respect to those.

They are suffering. Tidying will not correct the patriarchy.This is a combination of pseudo-mystical bollocks and 1950s consumerist nirvana.Here is one example: “While helping my clients to tidy their homes or offices, I stand in front of the mound of books they have piled on the floor and clap my hands, or I gently stroke the book covers. Although my clients will look at me strangely at first, they are inevitably surprised at how quickly and precisely they are able to choose after this.” Wicca is not a foundational action or operational plan to manage the excesses of capitalism. This stuff is nonsense. And it is most offensive to women. If we can just 'tidy' then our lives will make sense.Women work. Hard. Women need to shop less. Buy less. Invest less in material goods.

Some helpful tips but perhaps a bit too general for me in places.Full review: Marie Kondo's ""The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up"" isn't so much just an organizational book as it is a psychological one. It has a methodology, but it doesn't lie with a specific set of steps or system as much as it is an examination of one's own relationships with the things they have. I appreciated hearing about Kondo's path to being an organization expert, her own struggles and pitfalls along the way, and ultimately putting into practice what this book highlights as the Japanese approach and experience to decluttering. Putting to practice an all in one staging of singular categories, physically touching them to assess what value they have to you, and tossing those things that don't bring you joy. It is a simple process but not as simple in implementation as I'm making it out to be.And I somewhat understand this considering the principles of Feng Shui and how that relates to space. I even understand the concept of thanking one's space and giving an object thanks for what it provided you before you let it go. (Psychologists do something similar with hoarders to coach them though getting rid of things.) I got a keen appreciation of the Japanese approach to organization from this book. Yet, I still felt this missed something along the way. Part of it might've been Kondo's meandering tone (meaning the text wasn't as streamlined as it could've been) and another might be that I still felt something in the process might be missed. I could understand the principles here at the core - and they were good- but there were conflicting points that needed better address. I still enjoyed and got much out of the read, despite those qualms. so much that I'm looking forward to putting ideas from this to my own personal practice. Overall score : 3.5 / 5 stars."

Außerdem gibt sie viele wertvolle und v.a. auch konkrete Tipps, was das Aufräumen und das sich Trennen von Dingen angeht. Gerade mit letzterem habe ich oft meine Probleme und finde es sehr hilfreich, mir z.B. bei Geschenken vor Augen zu führen, dass sie im Moment des Schenkens ihren Zweck erfüllt haben.Bei vielen der Aspekte, die mich gestört haben, finde ich es schwer zu sagen, ob es an der Übersetzung, dem kulturellen Unterschied oder am Buch selbst liegt. Manchmal war ich in dieser Hinsicht z.B. unsicher, wie ernst bzw. augenzwinkernd gewisse Anekdoten gemeint sind. Andere Sachen erschließen sich mir einfach nicht (die Handtasche jeden Abend auszupacken) oder ich sehe das Problem nicht (der rostende Duschkorb im Bad). Das wäre an sich kein Problem, wenn der Ton des Buches nicht so herablassend klingen und nur sein Vorgehen als das einzig wahre zulassen würde. Teilweise ist es eine einzige Beweihräucherung der KonMari-Methode, dabei sollte der Inhalt mich doch selbst überzeugen.Weitere Kritikpunkte sind für mich die enorme Redundanz der Aussagen, das doch sehr traditionelle Rollenbild und, am Schlimmsten, die fehlende Nachhaltigkeit. Mit was für einer Euphorie da hunderte von vollgestopften Müllsäcken gefeiert werden, ist mir einfach zuwider. Ich verstehe natürlich, dass es darum geht, sich so schnell wie möglich von Überflüssigem zu befreien und du sollst diesen Müll ja auch nur ein einziges Mal im Leben produzieren, aber es werden halt so gut wie keine Alternativen für die Entsorgung aufgeführt (Secondhandläden, Spenden usw.).

The purpose of books like this isn't to buy it all; it's to take away the things from it that stick and matter to you personally. It's to understand the metaphors as a means of application -- thank your items, talk to them, love them, respect them -- it's not about having to SAY thank you every time, but instead, remembering that possessions are intimate parts of your life and being and that they're there to serve a purpose. They're bigger than things...which is precisely why it's so hard to get rid of them when they're served their purpose. The real wakeup part for me was the one about the purpose of gifting. That it's the act of love and not the thing itself. I'm better at being on the giving end, not the receiving, because I understand that in my own giving. I don't in the receiving. But reading that on paper will make getting rid of those items easier because it's not the attachment to the item. It's the invisible transaction that mattered. This is the kind of book worth reading, rereading, and refinding gems within. Because it's not just about the tidying of things. It's about the mental housekeeping. "

135,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,Rating 4 out of 5,"It's amazing that a tiny book on tidying can spark so much controversy. Marie Kondo, her KonMari Method of house cleaning, her Netflix show Tidying Up, and this book, the life-changing magic of tidying up (over 4 million copies sold), have become the center of a societal kerfuffle over how to best organize one's life. The controversy stems in part from Kondo's matter-of-fact delivery: her ideas are often perceived as directives rather than suggestions, with statements like ""I now keep my collection of books to about thirty volumes at any one time"" morphing online into ""Marie Kondo says you shouldn't have more than 30 books."" Misperceptions aside, she does call for a drastic, dramatic culling of personal possessions, with promises of immediate, life-altering results. I struggled over which rating to give this: while the book did contain sufficient wisdom and persuasion to inspire my own bout of intense and much-needed cleaning, it also says a lot of patently absurd things.Funny enough, I found this book on the giveaway table at work (a magical idea every office should implement), and that's precisely where it will return. Kondo refers regularly to her consulting business, in which people pay her to come to their houses and force them to make hard decisions about what needs to go. This book is the light version: it has all the same advice, but no Marie physically standing there to make you follow through. The basic process is to go through all your things, moving categorically from clothes to books to papers to knickknacks (komono being the term she uses) and eventually to sentimental items. By that more difficult stage, you should be better trained at knowing what you truly need. With each category, you pull all the representative items out of their containers and lump them together on the floor. That way, you can see exactly how many clothes you have, all together in context, and then pick up each one in turn and decide whether to get rid of it. The picking up is important in Kondo's method, as is the decision-making heuristic.""Does it spark joy?"" This question is the linchpin of the KonMari method, and the single-line that everyone walks away with. There are many criteria one could use to pare down possessions, such as ""Have I used this in the past year?"", ""Am I going to use this again?"", or ""Will anyone need this after I'm dead?"" Kondo wants you to pick up each item and contemplate whether it makes you feel joy. It's a smart rule of thumb, tied to an emotion rather than a rational process, and you get a pretty quick sense about which items feel like boondoggles and which you can't live without. We can all generate counter-examples: the cheese grater that registers neutrally on the joy scale, but will be needed for next week's enchiladas; but it makes sense to remove things that, as Kondo says, only tie you to the past or represent a fear for the future. The idea is that you learn to live in the present and get rid of the stuff that stifles or hides the items that truly matter. It's a good message: most of us hold on to WAY too much stuff, myself chief amongst you.It is also here that some troublesome implications come to fore. It's fine to pick up an item and ask if it sparks joy, but Kondo inserts an instinctive animism into everything. In her mind, household objects (and houses themselves) have feelings that can be hurt. If you want to get rid of something, you can ease the pain of separation by thanking that item for its service, even if it sat around in its original packaging. She frets for socks tortured into stretch balls, or purses that have to carry their contents day-to-day with no rest of emptiness. She claims that happy fabrics have a visible gleam, or that she can detect the ""glowing"" eyes of customers experiencing joy. Every session begins with a quick bow and word to the house asking it to help with the sorting process. Some of these flights of fantasy might bear out psychologically (I like the idea of thanking an item for its service), but others are... silly. Kondo's tendency to anthropomorphize and fill the world with magic calls to mind the famous Ikea commercial with the sad, rejected red lamp. A Swede steps forward to chastise us for feeling bad: ""That is because you are crazy. It has no feelings.""The link to the commercial includes a recent Ikea sequel encouraging us to reuse the red lamp, because conservation is important. It's another lesson that Marie Kondo could bear to learn. For her, success is measured in the number of trash bags each client has thrown away. She regularly brags about 30+ bags of junk being tossed out. While she does occasionally throw in the word ""recycle"" or ""donate"", there is no emphasis on proper disposal or repurposing of goods, or recommendations on how to do so. The sole focus is to get rid of stuff. While the KonMari method does seem to inspire a lot of waste, I will say that someone following the process is far less likely to accumulate more junk, so it's a green way to live after the purge has taken place. I'm surprised that digital archiving is not discussed... a picture of an item can help it scratch that sentimental itch, but perhaps that would go against her emphasis on cutting ties that need to be cut.Marie Kondo insists that this process, done right, is self-perpetuating and only has to happen once. She repeatedly claims that none of her dozens (hundreds?) of clients have gone back to their messy former lives, nor have they ever complained about things they threw away and later regretted. I do wonder how honest this is, or how comfortable former clients feel to share negative feedback with Kondo. Another critique is that the subtitle, ""the Japanese art of decluttering and organizing"" is a misnomer. There is nothing particularly Japanese about this method, and Kondo repeatedly talks about trying and discarding various techniques based on trial-and-error iteration, not from a Japanese source. Occasionally she'll talk about a particular feature of Japanese architecture, or Japanese storage tendencies, or how best to handle charms from Buddhist versus Shinto shrines, but the cleaning methods themselves are all Marie's.And yet, despite all those caveats, I found the book personally inspiring. While I do not have the time it would require to truly follow the method (despite Kondo's promises that it goes quickly), and I have no desire to be quite so ruthless in my reductions, I did tackle a lot of cleaning while reading this book that I had put off for years. My ability to look at a clean bookshelf and nightstand as I go to bed is worth the price of admission alone (had I paid for the book). I have gotten rid of (rather, given away and properly recycled) a bunch of clothes, books and papers that did not give me joy (which is now a running joke line in the house). I also started rolling (not balling) my socks and underwear, and standing my shirts vertically on end so I can browse them like books, and really like both methods. I do think a clean house removes a lot of psychological weight, and allows one to get more done and get more out of life. So it's a worthwhile pursuit! I also think it's helpful for an idea to have an associated icon and figurehead: Greta Thunberg for climate change, Gandhi for nonviolent protest, Jane Goodall for primate protection, and so on. Marie Kondo has become the personification of tidying, and brought the conversation to a society whose economy seems to depend on a surplus of unnecessary items. I'll leave you with a couple good quotes from the book:Our possessions very accurately relate the history of the decisions we have made in life. Tidying is a way of taking stock that shows us what we really like.When we really delve into the reasons for why we can't let something go, there are only two: an attachment to the past or a fear for the future."

A high degree of frustration can, however, prompt me to depart from custom and turn to instructions for guidance. A HIGH degree. Not surprisingly, I rarely read ""how to"" books. What's the point of paying for (in money and time) instructions if I know that my following them is about as likely as The Donald's speaking for five minutes without telling a McWhopper and then insulting the fact checkers?Nevertheless, when a desire to de-clutter my house overwhelmed me, I bought and read a ""how to"" book, The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Having finished Marie Kondo's work yesterday, I'm already not following her instructions. Correction -- most of them. Maybe I'm not sufficiently anal to adopt her method of ""tidying up."" Or perhaps I simply have trouble taking seriously anyone who asserts, ""Every piece of clothing has its own 'sweet spot' where it feels just right -- a folded state that best suits that item. . . . There is nothing more satisfying than finding that 'sweet spot'"" (76-77). Remember -- she's referring to clothes! And who writes, ""I can think of no greater happiness in life than to be surrounded only by the things I love""(202)??? Uh -- a person who ""believe[s] that inanimate objects respond to human emotions""(170). Despite the inclusion of comments that kept me chuckling and ""assessing"" Kondo's mental state, the book is not without useful suggestions (a.k.a. rules); and her 12,000(?)-step program is based on an inordinate understanding of why people live in disorganized, cluttered spaces. So at least 2 stars for this book -- even though it only looks like a book. Excise reiterative statements; remove blank pages that separate units; modify fonts and spacing; and through the ""magic of tidying up,"" the book would become a magazine article. NO NO NO No No No no no no -- I'm pretending that's how the author says, ""But then it couldn't be sold for $16.99."" "

No te dice que recicles, que pienses que sos afortunado porque tu casa está repleta de mercancías. No te compara con otros grupos humanos que pueden vivir con menos y sin ser consumistas extremos. No te dice que recicles, que dones, que canjees lo que no usás. No te genera conciencia social sobre la pobreza y la injusticia de que alguien tiene mil zapatos y otros ninguno. Te dice que tires. Es más, ella se pone contenta cuando sus clientes tiran lo que desechan en bolsas negras de residuos. La olla que aún sirve es basura. La ropa que no usaste pero esta nueva es basura y va al vertedero. Es un desgaste de recursos si pensamos que todo eso alguien lo está necesitando con urgencia. Es un libro muy superficial. Otro punto es el animismo que se me hace difícil de asumir. Dice que le hables a tus pertenencias como si fueran personas, que pongas cómodos los pares de media que ellos descansan en tanto están en el cajón. Si las cosas están felices, vos estás feliz, como una especie de magia imitativa.Sumo además que no te ayuda a lidiar con el sufrimiento o con la infelicidad. Para ella eso hay que quitarlo tirándolo por la ventana, pero uno tiene que poder manejar cierta dosis de tristeza, de nostalgia, de temor. Por lo anterior, sentí que es un libro que no te hace madurar sino que te vuelve a la etapa infantil, cuando el muñeco de goma habla y tiene frío y los niños lloran si se le cayó el ojo de botón porque ahora no ve y le duele. O los niños que no pueden manejar aún la tristeza porque no la entienden. Tampoco me gustó la serie de Netflix. Sentí que miraba la vida de opulencia de familias que solo piensan en ellas mismas. Puro egoísmo. Ni entiendo la fama mundial de este movimiento de tira en bolsas de basura y llévate una medalla de honor. "

Marie Kondo has a short, simple book that will appeal to many but not all. To me, the success of this book is evident looking at social media sites with #konmari. This book doesn't just allow you to think about organizing, it stirs you to take action.Why action? The author gives you the tools: organize by category. Look at everything in that category together. Purge what you don't absolutely need, and thing that don't bring you joy. Then find a home for your things and group like with like. That's it. I had purged clothes before, but never had asked myself about joy. I found I got rid of many clothes that I wear often despite the fact that they don't make me feel good about myself.Why won't some people like this book? As you can see from other reviews, people poke fun at the level of reverence Ms. Kondo has for objects and how she talks to them. This is something I liked best. I think when you truly honor and love the objects in your life, you will be more grateful for what you have and will take better care of your things.Some suggestions may not hit home, like emptying your bag every day. Also, Kondo really downplays the importance of storage solutions, and this is revealing of her evolution of thought on organization more than anything. She suggests shoeboxes for most things. Honestly, I see what she is getting: a great storage solution is worthless if it allows you to deepen the amount of crap in your life. But I've found that the perfect storage solution, like something to hold makeup and makeup brushes in a tidy way, brings me so much joy and makes my life so much easier.So you may laugh when you read this book. But try what she suggests and then see if you are still laughing."

Effective tidying involves only two essential actions: discarding and deciding where to store things. Of the two, discarding must come first.2. Sort by category, not by location.3. Make tidying a special event, not a daily chore.4. Selection criterion: take each item in one’s hand and ask “Does this spark joy?” If it does, keep it. If not, dispose of it.5. The best sequence for tidying is this: clothes first, then books, papers, komono (miscellany), and lastly, mementos.6. What you don’t need, your family doesn’t either.7. The key is to store things standing up rather than laid flat.8. Arrange your clothes so that they rise to the right. By category, coats would be on the far left, followed by dresses, jackets, pants, skirts, and blouses9. I recommend you dispose of anything that does not fall into one of three categories: currently in use, needed for a limited period of time, or must be kept indefinitely.10. Make sure that you keep all such papers in one spot only. Never let them spread to other parts of the house.11. When you are choosing what to keep, ask your heart; when you are choosing where to store something, ask your house.12. “letting go is even more important than adding”13. The question of what you want to own is actually the question of how you want to live your life.14. As for you, pour your time and passion into what brings you the most joy, your mission in life.Even after reading all of this if you feel like you wanna learn more so I have good news: Marie Kondo has her Tidying Up series on Netflix. As it’s my ritual to first read and then watch the particular film or series, I have been waiting to read this book so I could watch her series. Am I the only one who gets excited over tidying and organizing stuff?"

Each one promises you a shiny new life--free of clutter, dirty dishes, mismatched socks. Marie Kondo's book even has the phrase ""life-changing magic"" in the title, so of course I had to read it.Kondo's main idea is that physical objects are imbued with power, and your possessions should have the power to ""spark joy."" Don't grant burdensome objects the opportunity to roost in your home, filling you with resentment. Make room for those that spark you instead.I recently finished a completely unrelated book--investor Charles T. Munger's ""Poor Charlie's Almanack""--in which Munger attributes his extraordinary success as an investor to avoiding the mediocre and holding out for the really big ideas. In both books, the idea is clear: do less, own less, hold out for something you'll treasure. Why engage in a frenzy of materialism, buying things you're not sure you want? Why own things, when you don't know why? Why clutter your life with mediocrity? Save your attention for something that will transform you."

So far I've gotten rid of 55% of my stuff. Still a bit to go so I thought this book could help. Yes, it seems over tedious saying ""hold everything and see if it brings you joy. If you NEED it and can use it enough to keep it"" but it's just that. You'll find stuff you didn't even know you had or haven't used in years and those are easy throw aways/donations. Some you might linger on but all in all, this is a helpful tool. We all could use less ""stuff"" in our life to find clarity and serenity in our own spaces. I think this is a great book for those seeking less clutter and to keep things tidy, especially if they're having issues keeping it decluttered."

After I wrote my initial review, I got home from vacation and immediately went about my implementation of the Konmari Method. Contrary to the book's advice, I did not intend to accomplish everything in one go, because I started at 5pm and didn't have a whole free day in sight. The entire process took me about 18 hours over 5 days, and the results were nonetheless quite satisfying. My primary means of disposal was to give anything in reasonable condition to Value Village, my local thrift store. I gave away over eight large bags of clothing and several boxes of komono, or miscellany. I rolled all my socks and folded all my shirts, pants, and sweaters, organized items into shoeboxes, and systematically disposed of everything that had served its purpose or did not bring me joy. I threw away an entire large recycling bin full of papers from college and grad school, old magazines (I hope that Popular Science editions from 2004 never become valuable), and miscellaneous notes. The result was the lifting of a huge mental burden. My living space always bore a semblance of organization, but it was never tidy. Coming home every day to managed chaos was no way to live. Coming home to a neatly organized living space with plenty of room and surrounded by items that I do enjoy is quite nice. Also, like she said, I do feel more decisive after cleansing my space. Throughout my process of tidying I've also come away with a desire to prevent future accumulation of things. I enjoyed my tidying marathon, but I have no desire to ever do it again. On a philosophical level, I think I mostly appreciated what the book had to say as well. I believe in the notion that our attachments ought to be to people and not things. Items are to be used, and they ought not to use us. We should keep our possessions insofar as they serve a present need or ""spark joy,"" sure, but holding onto items that have already served their purpose, or that may serve some abstract future value, or that will rope the owner back to the past, is not necessarily healthy. It's important to be fully in the present - and let our possessions reflect that.----I'll update this review when I implement KonMari on my living space. I am very excited to do so.Big takeaways:- get rid of things do not spark joy- organize shirts light to dark- fold vertically- hang clothes up and to the right- discard before organizer- use shoeboxes- work by category and not location: clothes, books, miscellany, mementos in that order- designate a specific place for everything- focusing on storage is the wrong approach: it will make you a hoarder- I don't need most of the books I own- I don't need most papers- organization of the home space enables us to focus on what matters in life"

How do you decide what to keep? Simple. Kondo invites you to ask yourself if the item sparks joy. If it doesn’t, thank it for its service and get rid of it. Once you are left with only your most joy-giving belongings you place every item in a place where they are visible and accessible, and always put them back when you've finished them.The book's messages are more nuanced, however these are the book's techniques in a nutshell. It's a quick, easy and fun read. I really enjoyed Marie Kondo's notion that all items have feelings and an emotional life, and so respond to how they are treated. Other readers might find this a bridge too far. I was inspired by this book, and I have already taken two large bin liners of clothes to the charity shop, reconfigured my drawers and wardrobe so that I can easily see and access everything, filled three bin liners with rubbish, and taken two large boxes of books to charity book shop."

160,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2007216-peter-derk,Rating 3 out of 5,"I'm gonna give you my foolproof tidying plan. Ready?Move.Seriously, put everything you own into boxes, put those boxes into a vehicle, and move them somewhere else. Because that's the easiest way to clean up your life. All that shit you don't really want? Gone, baby! I didn't move for eight years, and then I moved twice in one year. The difference between the first and second move was pretty damn noticeable.Okay, as for this book, here's the good.Go through your crap category by category. All your clothes at once. Big pile on the floor. Handle every item, and see if it ""sparks joy.""That's the part that's a little strange to think of at first. Holding something and seeing if it sparks joy. And I'll admit, it's a little tough because, for example, the shirts I LIKE and the shirts I have to wear to work don't necessarily cross over. Same with pants. I warned my partner when we were on vacation that I had to pack a pair of khakis because I didn't have enough clean pairs of jeans before we left. I warned her specifically because I thought the shock of my wearing non-jeans on vacation would be a potential health risk.But I suppose there are lots of people who don't have that problem. I mean, there are grown men who wear plaid shorts and the kind of sandals I wore into the shower while living at a college dorm, so what do I know?Second, do it all at once. I actually get behind this. Many a great plan is foiled because we say, ""I'm going to throw out one thing per day."" Who can keep up with a daily thing? That's the hardest shit to do. Face it, we're wired to do a big, exhausting project, not to chip away at stuff one little bit at a time. I've always thought it would be great if you could go on a single, 20-mile run and have that be the same as going on 10 2-milers, or if you could just take one long dump every couple weeks, that would really solve a lot of the world's problems. Or hell, we've all thought how it would be great if you could sleep 56 hours straight and then stay up for a week, right?But it doesn't work like that with most things. So when it's possible to cram it all in, I say go for it, and so does this book.The book made a pretty good point about the difference between divesting yourself of stuff and organizing. You can be organized as hell, but that just means you have more room for stuff you probably don't even want. Solid advice.I also liked how this book, unlike so many others, didn't subscribe to an ""X number of things"" contest. I hate that shit. Oh, look at me. I have less than 100 objects in my house. I bet everyone would be really impressed if they came over, which they don't because every time it's a lecture about minimalism with you. I really appreciated that this book didn't go down that road. There were a couple things in the book I wholeheartedly disagree with.I'm a person who buys three tubes of toothpaste at a time. Or three things of deodorant. Because I've got my brands, I will absolutely use them, and running out only makes me feel like a dope. I know some people go overboard, but advising that people only have, say, one bar of soap in the house is kinda silly, to me.Also, the thing where you don't keep anything in the shower seems like too much work. I hate to be a knock it before I try it guy, but I have two bottles, bar of soap, and a razor. As for the thing where you talk to your objects at the end of the day...I actually kind of dug it. I mean, I don't have the guts to do it really, to look at my shoes and say, ""Thanks for carrying me today."" But I will say, I have this yearly ritual where I wear my old running shoes on a rafting trip, and by the end of the trip they're destroyed and have to be tossed. And when I throw them in the dumpster, I think about how far we went over the last year, and that's a good feeling.While it's weird to talk to your objects, I think it's one way people can show respect to the things they love. Most of us don't wear shoes that require polish anymore, most of us don't dress in a full suit that requires an undressing process in the evening. For the most part, our lives have made it easier to replace a worn object as opposed to maintaining it. I'm pretty charmed by the idea of thanking objects, especially as a stand-in for the maintenance that's really no longer required for our stuff.While we're on that and the idea of sparking joy, and with my move in mind, I've got this thing. A boombox that I couldn't throw out. I tried. When I moved this last time, I carried it to the dumpster and opened the lid, but when it was time to toss it in, I didn't want to. It's this boombox I've had since I was a kid. Like a little kid. There are marks on the radio tuner I painted on so I could turn the dial and get to my favorite stations real quick. It works, it's giant, and if you've got about 4 D batteries, you could even run the thing unplugged. I assume. I don't know if I've EVER done that successfully.I couldn't get rid of it. Or, more accurately, I didn't want to. When I held it in my hands, there was too much good feeling wrapped up in that thing.That brings me to the part of the book that I felt the most ambivalent about. The author said something about how you should live the life you want for yourself today, for the person you are today. Not the life of yourself from the past.I don't have a ton of nostalgia, really. I kinda thought everything sucked from kindergarten until about the end of high school. Not because I was some cool outsider, a real Bender type or something. Because I was pretty lonely and worried about stuff all the time. If we're going with our John Hughes tropes, more of a Cameron from Ferris Bueller, I guess. I DID like the Red Wings. And I did stay home sick a lot, although I didn't have an asshole buddy who dragged me out of bed to be the third wheel on a city-spanning date with his girlfriend. What a dick.Anyhoo, I don't hold on to a lot of stuff because it reminds me of a better time. But there are a handful of things, like that boombox, that I just feel too strongly to get rid of. Where I don't know if they spark joy, but they were the point of light in an otherwise bad time. Where they're maybe something that doesn't take me back to that bad place, but rather, remind me how it's possible to get through the bad places. I'm gonna try this with my clothes. But for now, the boombox stays."
161,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38230974-junta,No Rating,"Hey, I probably won't end up reading this book, but I started using the author's methods for decluttering/organising my room yesterday, and so far it's been useful.A couple of days ago I watched a 17-minute video on YouTube - a segment from a Japanese TV show where Kondō visited a singer's family apartment and applied some of her methods to his room. I've only watched that video handling one room, so going through a whole place might be a slightly different story with additional methods incorporated, but the gist of it will probably be the same. While my room is pretty clean and there aren't an awful lot of things apart from books and clothing, I know that I could do away with a lot of things here, so I decided to try it out.So, decluttering your room - Kondō advises to go about it in categories of objects, not by their place in the room (""if you go by place, you'll never manage to organise your room.""). The order goes1. Clothing2. Books3. Paperwork4. Miscellaneous objects (e.g. CD's, DVD's, stationery, electronic goods, kitchenware, cosmetics, medical products, jewellery, expendable goods) 5. MemorabiliaSo, for each of those categories, what you do is simple - you gather everything, absolutely everything in this category into one spot (well, on the floor). Then, you pick up one at a time, and, well, think about whether it brings you joy/you feel your heart flutter over it, in deciding whether to keep it. Kondō seems to be catching a lot of flak in the reviews here for this central part of her rationale for how insane it sounds, but in my view you just need to interpret her words into something you understand and can put into practice. It isn't that hard. There is a slight translation issue, since it doesn't sound as outlandish in Japanese - it's more like, whether you intuitively feel that you need this object, rather than feel joy over it, as I believe it's been translated into English as.Yesterday morning I pulled out all of my clothing items from my wardrobe and closet, and a regular hill was born (you can leave all the stuff on hangers on hangers, of course). Things I wear often, things I wear occasionally, things I hadn't seen for a long time, things I had forgotten even existed. Previously, I don't think I was as efficient in decluttering for clothing as I was thinking more about what I should get rid of, rather than what I want to keep, as with her ('KonMari') method. After a while I got tired of changing in and out of clothes I hadn't seen for a while in front of the mirror so a miniature Fuji was left on my floor overnight, and I completed the task today - old pants, t-shirts, undies, socks, suits, dress shirts, shorts, etc. etc. all got together in a huge bag, and my wardrobe and closet were feeling some libido they'd long been missing out on. I weighed the bag, and it was over 9kg!Anyway, if you're good at decluttering and keeping your room organised there might not be much new here, but the small part of her methods I caught from the video were pretty useful. When I watched the video her name seemed familiar and I realised that I'd seen this book on Goodreads, though I probably hadn't added it because of some of the reviews. I was surprised to find out that she was in the list of the 2015 Times' 100 Most Influential People In The World, for her methods and this book which has been translated into various languages and published in over 30 countries.Happy decluttering.Edit: ignore Kondō's advice on books - she doesn't love books (see Olga's review), and I think it's obvious we bibliophiles on here don't need help with them.March 30, 2016"

Basically I've reached the point of quarantine where I need to clean my entire room out, which is my weekend project Some of her tips were really weird such as having your socks sitting up because they ""need to go on vacation"" and to fold all clothes instead of hanging them in your closet.. That was weird to me. Also, putting everything in a giant pile and sorting through them is a stressful process but IT WORKS for the most part. I already always did this but I would do that with clothes and I would never do that with my books. Sorry Marie, I'm keeping my books. Those do, in fact, spark joy. Some things she said were so relatable such as keeping useless makeup samples and using clothes that you don't wear as lounge clothing instead but then never actually wearing them. I felt attacked. Marie Kondo also said sweatpants aren't very attractive so I felt PERSONALLY attacked. She lost a star for that. Oh, and she claimed that cleaning can help you lose weight and clear up your skin.???????Basically, to sum up. I felt slightly inspired but also, mostly not."

I might even admit to having indulged once or twice) or throwing away all items that don't 'spark joy' (I'm looking at you, Toilet Brush)...well, lady, it just ain't going to happen.

Cái ấy đúng, vì ngay khi tôi thực sự mong mỏi mình có nhiều không gian sống hơn thì đồ đạc của tôi bắt đầu đội nón ra đi một cách dứt khoát và đau đớn vô cùng: mất xe và giường - hai thứ đốt nhiều không gian nhất phòng =))) Giờ thì chiều chiều thì tôi cuốc bộ để đi chợ, tối tối tôi trải chăn ra sàn để nằm ngủ và sáng sáng tôi cuốn gọn chăn nệm lại rồi đi bộ ra bến xe bus :<Trở lại với vấn đề cùng nụ cười trên môi, tôi tin nếu đọc xong cuốn sách này, lòng tràn trề quyết tâm và làm theo lời tác giả thì chắc chắn bạn sẽ vứt bỏ được một lượng rác khổng lồvà biết cách sắp xếp đồ đạc khoa học hơn. Trong sách có kha khá mẹo vặt hữu ích, tuy nhiên tôi là đứa nghiện dọn dẹp và đọc báo lá cải phụ nữ nên biết cũng gần hết. Khi có thể nén được 2 cái giá sách, một cái giường đơn, một cái bàn học lớn, một cái bàn uống trà, một tủ đựng áo quần, một tủ đựng chén bát gia vị, một cái bếp ga to, 3 con mèo béo trong khoảng không gian tầm 15m2 mà vẫn có còn chỗ trống cho tôi nằm lăn lóc và lũ mèo rượt nhau thì nói chung tôi không phải là tay mơ trong lĩnh vực này. Duy có một cái rất tuyệt mà có lẽ nhiều người chưa biết, đó là không để các lọ hóa mĩ phẩm ở trong phòng tắm!!! Nói cho cùng thì lí do mà phòng ốc và cuộc đời chúng ta bừa bộn, ấy là vì chúng ta ưu tiên chữ ""tiện"" hơn là ""đúng"" nên cảm thấy việc phải đi xa thêm vài bước chân để lấy cái chai dầu gội đầu thì vô lý quá, trong khi đó, mỗi tuần bỏ ra tầm nửa tiếng để lau chùi nhớt bám trên mấy cái chai + khay đựng chúng thì thấy bình thường :| Tôi đã thử và sạch hơn hẳn, còn bạn? :3 - Trong sách, tác giả còn dạy cách tâm sự với đồ đạc :))) Vâng, sau mèo, đồ ăn thì chúng ta sắp được thấy người Nhật nói chuyện tình cảm với sách vở, áo quần, văn phòng phẩm và cái túi xách. Tuy nhiên, đây không phải là vấn đềgiao tiếp với đồ đạc mà là chuyện bạn thực sự cảm nhận như thế nào về một thứ, về việc nó quan trọng thế nào đối với cuộc sống của bạn. Nhiều người cứ tha quá nhiều rác về nhà vì họ không thành thật với bản thân mình trong chuyện này. Mua vì rẻ, vì khuyến mãi, vì nghĩ là mình sẽ cần, mua vì lương mới về, mua vì có người trả tiền, mua vì ai cũng có mà mình chưa có,... Chúng ta phải hiểu rõ mình trước khi hiểu về đồ vật.

Đó là nên ngừng việc tích trữ đồ đạc. Việc chạy theo chủ nghĩa tiêu thụ không chỉ đốt của chúng ta cả núi tiền, của Trái đất này biết bao nhiêu nguyên liệu, hủy hoại môi trường mà còn đốt một đống thời gian để mua, bảo trì và dọn dẹp chúng. Tất cả đều là những chi phí vô hình nhưng khi tính lại mới thấy nó nặng nề đến nhường nào. Ví dụ thực tế, tôi rút được từ một buổi sáng ngày thứ 7 để còng lưng lau mọi ngóc ngách trong nhà, cọ nhà vệ sinh và cố gắng xếp gọn kệ sách, xếp áo quần và thêm nửa buổi chiều nằm dài ra vì mệt quá xuống một giờ cho tất cả những thứ đó. Thời gian còn lại tôi nằm ườn ra phơi nắng, đọc sách, đắp mặt nạ, ngủ với mèo,... nghĩa là toàn những chuyện tôi thích trong một không gian thoáng đãng và sạch sẽ hơn ^^Đấy, theo như bí quyết thứ hai thì tôi sẽ không bao giờ ra hiệu sách rồi mua cuốn sách này =))) Vì nó tiêu tốn không gian của tôi.

170,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23066833-bloodorange,Rating 4 out of 5,"Post-read edit: Added 4th star. Rarely do I see self-help books which really help, once you give them the chance.This is a really useful book, particularly therapeutic if you feel guilty about throwing away/ donating your things; the author reasons with the reader, patiently providing statistics (the average chance that you will reread a book you've read already if you are not an academic? 15%) and arguments to help you part with 'difficult gifts' from family members, for example.I essentially agree with the basics precepts of the book, which are: - be honest about whether you use the items you own- throw away/donate items you do not use and/or do not like- make the segregation process thorough, but quick (this is probably one of the reasons why Kondo does not suggest selling things - this would definitely create the room for misgivings and 'adopting' the discarded items back)- store items owned so that you can see them/ in a way conducive to using them.The author is young and zealous, but I must say she gives lots of practical advice. Still, content-wise, I can see two potential weak points: first, the book documents life in a very affluent society, and may be grating to some. Secondly, it seems to be primarily addressed to single (not to mention childless) people, with only a few consoling statements along the lines of ""To quietly work away at disposing of your own excess is actually the best way of dealing with a family that doesn’t tidy. As if drawn into your wake, they will begin weeding out unnecessary belongings and tidying without your having to utter a single complaint...""orCleaning quietly on one’s own generates another interesting change—the ability to tolerate a certain level of untidiness among your family members.""The reason why I can't find it in me to give the book 4 stars is part V, full of woo-woo psychobabble, which makes me too embarrassed to really recommend this book to people (and it deserves to be recommended)."

Marie Kondo is Japanese, and it's clear she knows her profession and does it with a lot of passion.I found this book really useful, very interesting and her approach different. She approaches 'tidying' with a more philosophical and spiritual way that could make it permanent rather than temporary. I never believed in those 'if you didn't use it for a year' filter, so to read something totally different was really refreshing. Her writing is charming, not boring as well. I would definitely recommend it if you're also somehow struggling to keep your house in order and want to live in a place where you only have your 'loved' possessions. "
172,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"I started reading this book after reading an article in New York Times and I was expecting to read about minimalism in the Japanese culture, but both the contents and the writing style dissapointed me.The book is funny at times, a non-intentional humour that comes from a series of syllogistic constructions that are meant to convince the reader the KonMari method (a method of tidying the author invented herself and perfected since she was five years old!) is the one true way to tidy and be at peace with yourself.

Therefore, I didn’t think this book was for me. But with all of the hype, I thought ‘why not?’. Since I have finished this book, I have gotten rid of over 60 pieces of clothing, 50 books (I still have a ton of books), 30 bottles of nail polish, a ton of coffee cups... the list goes on. I feel so much freer now. I had a clean, and organized home before, but now I can add ‘clutter-free’ on the list. I highly recommend it! "
177,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1805180-seak,Rating 3 out of 5,"While I was forced to read this book (by my wife), I guess I can't say it was all that bad. It was actually pretty enlightening and I'll share a couple things I gleaned.But first, the parts that annoyed me.Marie Kondo has a habit of personification of things. To an odd degree. I believe I get it and I'll address that below, but it's still a bit strange. She essentially does a seance with a house she's been hired to help with and talks about thanking things. Like your stuff.And she repeats herself. It almost felt copy and paste from a previous section.There's really no scientific support for anything and I'd like to see some more tests done to challenge her theories (most of which I think are probably correct btw).Now, on to the good stuff.I have to say that her method sounds plausible. She doesn't tackle clean up like most, she talks about changing yourself. You wouldn't think that's something you'd have to do for cleanup (or tidying) but I think she's right about that.You have to change your outlook to be better with money and I think she's right about tidying. Her focus is not on getting rid of things (of which there is plenty), but on keeping things that you love or which ""spark joy."" She is insistent upon handling every single item in your possession, be it a pair of underwear, a forgotten piece of mail, or your child (just kidding on the last one). She then talks about going through clothes first, because they're the easiest to part with if they don't bring you joy, and then moving on to harder things to get rid of. She places books second and I would probably say I'm speaking to the crowd that would disagree with this placement.Again, I like this theory because she talks about getting better at making decisions as you go along. On top of this, you really get to know yourself and what brings you joy. Your stuff is part of you whether you like it or not. It's on this life journey with you and shows the decisions you've made in the past. You can thank your stuff (odd, but I get it) for what it has given you and let go of the things that don't bring you that joy.And I think I get why she personifies the objects and that's because it is easier to get rid of because we're all psycho, mass-murderers right?!?!!? No, but I think it's more because she talks about the objects sparking joy and if not, you thank it for its service and life lesson to you. It's a friend or an acquaintance or even an enemy. If you kept in touch with all of them, you'd go crazy. And that's what we do with our stuff. It all makes us either feel good or guilty, happy or makes us anxious. Or maybe we feel indifferent, but why keep something like that around. We should surround ourselves with happiness. That's not a bad idea.I have to admit, when I was a kid, I'd feel bad for not playing with a certain toy in a while. Like, I betrayed it. Kondo also provides some good tips as to how to approach your new tidy life. On the whole, I wasn't extremely happy to read this, but I have to say I didn't hate it. In fact, it was probably life-changing. 3.5 out of 5 Stars (grudgingly given...)"
178,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/284485-kara,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book, to me, is divided into two very distinct sections: the discarding section and the rest. The discarding section is genius. Start with clothes then move onto books then papers then miscellany then things with sentimental value. So far, I've done clothes. I was so inspired after reading this part of the book that I got up right away to get started. I am not a neat person. I am a very messy person. I hate tidying. But I was exhilarated. This is going to sound a little batty, but Kondo says you should take all of your clothes (not just the ones in your closet, but all of them), and dump them in one spot. Then you should touch each article and decide if it brings you joy. If it does not, get rid of it. By this method, I managed to collect three boxes of clothes to sell, two bags to donate, and one bag to toss. I always thought I was pretty good at weeding out clothes (I'd get rid of anything with holes or stains or that I hadn't worn in a while), but going through this process made me realize that I kept a lot of clothes I don't like, need, or wear. For example, I have so many t-shirts from special events that sit in the back of my closet and never see the light of day. Do these bring me joy? No. So into the donation pile they went. I feel so much lighter after getting rid of so much.So why three stars?While I think ""does this spark joy"" is a great meter by which to measure clothes, books, and mementos, it's a poor one for most household objects. I'm sorry, but my bottle of ibuprofen doesn't make me feel anything close to joy, and I can't muster up joy for my phone charger or that pair of scissors or the box of tissue.There were also hints of what I'm going to refer to as ""battiness"" throughout the first section of the book. Kondo clearly has some OCD tendencies--she has full-heartedly embraced them, and I admire that. But I don't have those tendencies. I can't imagine a young child reading organizing magazines for fun or getting upset at the rest of her family for not being as neat as she was. Kondo loves tidying to an extreme level and has for her whole life. I can admire that, but here's where it gets a little stranger:-- Kondo talks to her things. She welcomes her house when she gets home, she thanks her shoes for their hard work, and she tells her clothes that they did a good job that day. -- She empties out her entire purse every night, putting everything away, and then repacks it in the morning. -- She almost cried when she saw how slimy her shampoo and soap got when it was in a rack, and now she keeps them under the counter. She insists that you must wipe off all bottles after the shower. -- When she goes into a client's house for the first time, she kneels formally on the floor and introduces herself to it. -- She claims that her clients lose weight and look healthier after her process. All in all, I'm glad I picked this up. I'm grateful that it helped me to purge my clothes, and the minute I finish writing this, I'm going to move on to books. "

(I use that word loosely). Anyway, Marie Kondo's book was reviewed on Houzz, a blog/forum devoted to everything house/home, from renovating to decorating. There were a heck of alot of comments on this particular review and people talked about this book passionately...it changed their lives. So, I had to check it out. Having buried my sister and my Mom in the last four years and helped to get rid of all their stuff, I have come to feel very strongly that we all collect way too much in the way of material goods and it really doesn't contribute to our happiness. It just clutters up our desktops, drawers, office spaces, basements, kitchens, and anywhere else we can find to squirrel it away. The book is a very good, concise treatise on cleaning up your home and cleaning up your life. I really enjoyed Kondo's approach to getting rid of all the things that we clutter up our lives with. Her ruthless and methodical approach is very effective if you follow it. If you care to look her up on youtube there are all kinds of people demonstrating how they implemented her plan. The only part of the book I can't bring myself to embrace is her advice on purging books. I have a lot of books and have gone through them all, testing for the attachment and joy they bring. I have gotten rid of many books but still have quite a library of fiction in addition to dog books, perfume books, finance books, science books and psychology books that I know I won't find in any library. She talks about maybe keeping about 30 books and says things like 'who ever will re-read their books?' Obviously, we will have to agree to disagree on this point! At any rate, I highly recommend checking this book out. Its a quick read and really can spur you on to lighten the load of all the physical and emotional baggage encompassed in the things we fill our homes with. "

It was unrealistic, at times really arrogant and slightly crazy. I honestly couldn't believe what I was reading when I went through the author's stories she's taken from her own life or her clients' experiences with her. It didn't read like a book with tips for decluttering and cleaning, but like a story of someone's obsession. And when I got to the part where the author started describing inanimate objects as living and feeling creatures, I lost it.There was also one big thing that I couldn't agree on - how much emphasis the author put on throwing things away. At times she would even brag about how many trash bags her clients or she threw away. I'm a huge advocate of recycling as much as you can and I can't imagine throwing away tons of still good books, CDs, DVDs or clothes which could still be used and enjoyed by someone else. I could barely keep a straight face when the author described how she used to tear out the pages of the books with passages that she liked, because keeping the whole book would be a waste of space and noting down favourite quotes would be a waste of time. What? On top of that, throwing out things that belong to other family members without their consent is a big no for me, and while the author admitted that it's bad, she still underlined that it can be done without your family knowing, if you do it properly.I could probably point out more things that made me dislike this book but I think that's enough for me. I understand that everyone has their own opinion and I've never told anyone that this or this book shouldn't have been published, but I have to say that I'm truly surprised at the popularity of Marie Kondo's book. And I will gladly exchange it for another (hopefully better) book soon."

La solución que plantea, una vez ya hemos elegido nuestros favoritos es la siguiente:
“Al final, decidí arrancar del libro las páginas relevantes.”
Lo siento, pero no quiero ser cómplice de un asesinato literario.Posteriormente, conforme avanzaba la lectura, la autora afirma que las personas que siguen el método pierden peso, ganan en salud y descubren sus verdaderas vocaciones. Bueno, creo que quizás es exagerar un poco, aunque es cierto que el hecho de tirar ciertos objetos nos puede ayudar psicológicamente a pasar página.Después de todo, el libro me ha hecho reflexionar en algunos aspectos y espero ponerlos pronto en práctica, con cuidado, ya que hay peligrosos efectos secundarios tras el proceso:
“Cuando desechamos todo de un tirón, lo cual a veces significa tirar 40 bolsas de basura en un día, nuestro cuerpo responde de manera semejante a un ayuno breve. Tal vez suframos un brote de diarrea o nos aparezca un sarpullido.”

Per me non funziona proprio così... In ogni caso ho provato ad applicare il metodo e devo dire che in effetti, riordinando per categorie di cose, è più facile fare un censimento della montagna di roba che abbiamo in casa (spesso senza rendercene conto) e di conseguenza procedere allo smaltimento del superfluo.Mi è piaciuto il criterio usato per scegliere cosa tenere e cosa buttare: si tengono solo le cose che ci piacciono in modo particolare, che ci provocano delle emozioni.

Esisteva un modo per liberarsi di quei libri senza ripensamenti? Trovai il compromesso ideale nel metodo di «riduzione del volume». In poche parole, piuttosto che tenere tutto il libro, conservavo una parte delle informazioni e le parole che mi avevano colpito. [...] Alla fine, decisi che era più semplice strappare la pagina corrispondente. Incollarla sul quaderno era seccante, perciò semplificai la procedura inserendo le pagine strappate in un raccoglitore. Facendo così non ci volevano più di cinque minuti. Senza problemi riuscii a sistemare una quarantina di libri e a conservare le parole che mi interessavano, ottenendo risultati molto soddisfacenti.

Pero soy muy vaga para todo lo demás especialmente para ordenar la ropa.Cuando me casé y me mudé me deshice de muchas cosas y durante varios años mi casa estuvo bastante limpia y ordenada, pero últimamente se salió de control y tengo pilas de libros sin leer en el piso, cajas con lanas y revistas para revisar en varios lugares, etc. El desorden me molesta y me llena de culpa pero no lo suficiente como para hacer algo al respecto.El año pasado algo hizo click en mi cabeza, y finalmente pude deshacerme de cosas de valor sentimental o acumuladas por años sin problemas. También noté que después de un cambio de dieta, tengo más energía para hacer cosas y me organizo mejor, e incluso tengo ganas de resolver el desorden de una vez por todas, pero no sabía por donde empezar.Así que me puse a leer este libro que tengo hace bastante, y tiene muchos consejos prácticos que pueden ser de mucha utilidad, otros no tanto (hay papelerío que tengo y me super fastidia pero que no puedo tirar porque lo uso para trabajar, por ejemplo, o insumos para manualidades que me ocupan bastante espacio pero no voy a tirar, porque son parte de un hobby etc). Sí es cierto que al ir ordenando en este último mes y tirando cosas de acuerdo a lo sugerido por la autora, la casa se ve más despejada y limpia y eso aumenta el bienestar. También es cierto que al ir limpiando y ordenando el resto de la familia ""se contagia"" (en mi caso mi esposo se está deshaciendo de cosas que hace años que rondan por la casa sin lugar ni propósito) y perdemos menos tiempo limpiando o buscando cosas que no sabemos dónde están.Todavía falta mucho, pero el libro es un buen comienzo, y espero mantener y continuar el orden!"

A kako sam trenutno u procesu velike selidbe, pomislih da je pravi trenutak i da je pročitam.Prvo da kažem: nema tu nikakve čarolije, samo komercijalnog proizvoda jedne prilično neurotične Japanke. Cela knjiga bi se mogla svesti na sledeće: bacite sve što vam ne izaziva radost (?), a preostalim stvarima nađite mesto i stalno ih tamo stavljajte. Kad kaže stalno, to stvarno i misli - žena prazni torbu svaki dan i vadi stvari koje će svakako opet sutra vratiti u istu. Sa prvom premisom se donekle slažem - zbilja sam uživala u bacanju džakova i džakova stvari prilikom selidbe. Doduše, ja sam bacala neupotrebljive stvari, a upotrebljive poklanjala a Mari Kondo se zalaže da se sve baca. I to je ono što me najviše nervira. Reciklažu pominje samo kod električnih aparata, a tera svoje klijente da bacaju odeću i knjige, po principu ""Neće vam to trebati, a ako i zatreba - uvek možete kupiti novo."" Dakle, zalaže se tu za neki minimalizam, a ustvari je oličenje konzumerističkog društva.Dala sam dve zvezdice jer mi je bila zabavna - naročito njeni nervni slomovi kad vidi da neku mota čarape u kugle ""jer se tako čarape ne mogu odmoriti"" ili kad joj soba u detinjstvu prosto nije bila dovoljno čista. Pritom, nigde ne spominje brisanje prašine i pranje podova, kao da se pospremanje završava sa stavljanjem stvari na police.Uglavnom, zaobići u širokom luku. Ili nemojte.

Obviously she is insane but in a good way! I love the way she goes through the logic and rationale for each of her theories and adds interesting anecdotes about her childhood and others' experiences. It is all very well thought out. Her idea of picking up and holding each item and asking yourself if it brings you joy and discarding if not with a thank you to the item for the happiness it may have given you is clever. She is so right that this is a cathartic learning experience about who you are and what is important to you. It forces you to take a look at yourself and what you want out of life instead of burying it in the back of a drawer. And if you remove the burden of unnecessary things you can focus on what matters and makes you happy. I totally understand this in a house of 5 busy people. It is like a granite boulder over me. All her ideas really make sense about the nuances of what works and what doesn't and why. I have a little issue with her idea of getting rid of books though...I still have about 30 pages to read but had to return it to the library and there is now an 85 person wait to get it.

І справді хочеться багато чого викинути. 3) Розумієш, що прибирання теж може бути наукою і по ньому можна писати наукові праці4) Гасло ""Залишайте тільки ті речі, які приносять тобі радість"" - геніальне5) Вся ця філософія природна для японської культури, яка шанує мінімалізм. В Україні її підх��д застосовувати на повну силу не можна. Бо це суперечить нашій культурі. Бо ми не живемо на острові, в нас безкраї простори і місця хватить для всього, ""а там я ще бурячки посаджу"". Бо в нас останні сотні років як не різанина так експропріація, як не війна то голодомор - і накопичення для української культури це не розкіш, а засіб виживання. І ми не Японія, де можна прийти в магазин і купити нормальний одяг. В українських магазинах якісного одягу за адекватними цінами не існує поки що.

196,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8970951-emily,Rating 4 out of 5,"I was rearing to give this three stars but then I had a Moment(TM) near the end and decided it hit me right where I needed it so I bumped it up.I'm currently on a proposed year-long decluttering project documented via blog, in which I try to get rid of something (or a pile of things) every day, and I couldn't put off reading this any longer. While Kondo mentions this kind of project as doomed to fail, after a while I saw that by eliminating things in categories with the hope of finishing by June (6 months), I'm actually not too far off from her ""quick"" method. But I needed some help sorting out my brain.A few disclaimers about the book. Kondo can be repetitive. She hypes up her method throughout with superlative language like it's an infomercial. The translation is written in a basic style with plenty of cliches. But I appreciated the ideas.Here's an incomplete list of things I took away from this book, mostly for my own reference because Goodreads is my storage cabinet for bookish reflection:-Declutter by category, not location, and:-Put all the things you own in each category in one place so you can see how much you have-Start with the least nostalgic categories and work toward the most nostalgic-Focus on what you want to keep-Hold each item in your hand and sort them one at a time-""Thank"" those hard-to-let-go-of items for the joy they gave you in the past and bid them farewell-Tidying hones our decision-making skills-Make your space reflect and encourage the lifestyle you aspire to have-Take the time to appreciate the things you have and choose to keep!!-""Storage...is the sacred act of choosing a home for my belongings"" (but don't work on storing until you've discarded completely)-Designate a place for each thing, otherwise your recently cleared off dresser will become cluttered quite quickly with homeless miscellany (adding in my recent experience here)-Store vertically instead of piles. Piles make it too easy to neglect what's on the bottom and keep stacking, whereas adding to vertical storage always takes consideration because it takes up more space.-Your brain sees all text as information to be sorted, so get rid of unnecessary labels and words crowding your room and headspace if they don't bring you joy.-Take the tags off your new clothes when you bring them home! Integrate them into your wardrobe right away or don't buy them?? (I needed this)-Reflect on your patterns of ownership--why have you kept the things you've kept? Are you afraid of letting go of the past or being unprepared for the future?-Confronting all of the stuff you own also means confronting your past-Don't keep things out of guilt!-Keep things out of joy!-Don't treat your parents' house like a dumping ground for nostalgic mementos!-We can only cherish a limited number of things at a timeMaybe you buy this, maybe you don't, but as someone who was desperately looking for helpful, overarching philosophical ways to think about the process of discarding, I needed this. Also, I grew up watching Toy Story so I have no problem metaphorically thanking my things for the joy they have brought me in the past before I let them go. (Imagine the sad toy faces if you don't!)Am I going to hang my sponges on the veranda to dry from now on? No. Will I remove everything from the shower each time and put it in the cupboard? No, but I can see where she's coming from. Will I empty my purse each time I come home? Probably not, but I should actually be aware of what's in it and remember to empty out receipts and gum wrappers from time to time. Am I gonna shrink my book collection down to 40 books? HECK NO, but I do need to get rid of some, and I agree with her that ""The moment you first encounter a particular book is the right time to read it."" That's what I want for my future--no more adding to a collection for someday because other stuff has beat it out for the priority TBR. In the end, I found more in here that was helpful than not. I went in wanting to take something away, and I did. The idea that the things we keep from our past hold us down resonates with me as I sit in my childhood bedroom writing this, desperate to start the next stage of my life but not yet having any luck. Maybe this year at home will have been my year of sorting through the past before I could move on to the future? I hope?Anyway, here are some quotes I want to remember purely for my own reference:""By handling each sentimental item and deciding what to discard, you process your past. If you just stow these things away in a drawer or cardboard box, before you realize it, your past will become a weight that holds you back and keeps you from living in the here and now. To put your things in order means to put your past in order, too. It's like resetting your life and settling your accounts so that you can take the next step forward.""""It is not our memories but the person we have become because of those past experiences that we should treasure. This is the lesson these keepsakes teach us when we sort them. The space in which we live should be for the person we are becoming now, not for the person we were in the past.""""The fact that you possess a surplus of things that you can't bring yourself to discard doesn't mean you are taking good care of them. In fact, it is quite the opposite. By paring down to the volume that you can properly handle, you revitalize your relationship with your belongings. Just because you dispose of something does not mean you give up past experiences or your identity. Through the process of selecting only those things that inspire joy, you can identify precisely what you love and what you need.""""The question of what you want to own is actually the question of how you want to live your life.""""The process of facing and selecting our possessions can be quite painful. It forces us to confront our imperfections and inadequacies and the foolish choices we mad in the past. . . . The things we own are real. They exist here and now as a result of choices made in the past by no one other than ourselves. It is dangerous to ignore them or to discard them indiscriminately as if denying the choices we made. . . . It is only when we face the things we own one by one and experience the emotions they evoke that we can truly appreciate our relationship with them."""

Not only has she published this book but she's all over the net, she has a tv series and she has a huge waitlist of clients willing to lay out hard earned cash to be taught her method. So I expected her to knock my socks off. Alas, I wasn't a fan of the book. Her ideas were quirky, tending towards kooky, and I found this both off-putting and funny. Yet there must have been something about them as I'll admit I spent some of my Easter successfully applying her tidying tips. So, why wasn't I more enthusiastic about her book? She was quite the fanatic and she sparked a defensiveness in me I didn't expect. I found myself questioning some of her methods (many actually) which were said in all seriousness yet to my ears sounded completely ludicrous. She insisted that thanking our possessions for their hard work was an absolute necessity. So was greeting the house when you return after a being out and about. Emptying your handbag at the end of the day, every day, and putting everything away in its place even when you know you will use the same bag and contents the very next day. Deciding what to keep or discard involved picking up each item and holding it in you hands. If it did not ""spark joy"" it was gone. There were other examples such as giving your items a good life, the life they deserve. And don't get me started on the benefits of tidying she claimed. I was prepared to accept the title as a bit of a gimmick to draw people in, but no, Marie Kondo extolled her tidying technique as one that has been known to result in people losing weight and gaining clear complexions, (though she did admit there was no scientific evidence for such linkages). While I mock some of the things that sounded bizarre there were others that kind of resonated with me. Things come to you for a reason, they serve their purpose and once that purpose has been served it's okay to get rid of them. (Actually it was more like you must get rid of them). I thought about this as I filled bag after bag of clothes for the Charity bin. So many items I had because I'd been unable to resist a bargain (but had hardly worn). Their purpose had been providing joy during the shopping trip, the thrill of the bargain hunt but their job was done and now I had to let it go and allow the item to find a new life elsewhere. And whilst I rolled my eyes as she explained most people don't know how to fold clothes properly I decided to give her method a shot. Instead of piling clothes one on top of the other I stacked them vertically as suggested and to give credit where credit is due, I liked this solution and can see this one sticking. Look it's a relatively short book to read (or listen to as was the case for me) and I won't tell you there's any magic or life changing involved but you may pick up one or two hints along the way."
206,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27203016-michelle-curie,Rating 3 out of 5,"I am neat. It's not a decision I ever consciously made, but the thought of having long forgotten stuff lying around drives me insane, which is why my home is more on the minimalist side of things. While I'm a hoarder in some regards, I'm the happiest with the bare necessities to my name. At least that's what I used to think. Marie Kondō, however, takes tidying up to a whole new level. With her debut The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up she gives guidance for determining what we really need in our home and how to go on about decluttering it, as well as explaining why we should care at all.
""Tidying is just a tool, not the final destination. The true goal should be to establish the lifestyle you want most once your house has been put in order.""
While to me, tidying up has always been means to and end, Marie Kondō takes an almost spiritual (yet definitely radical) approach. Her rule of thumb is easy - discard everything that doesn't spark joy. While, after reading that book, I am a bit fed up with that phrase, it sounds plausible: if something doesn't make you happy, there's no reason to keep it. We keep many things for sentimental reasons, knowing that they won't get us anywhere anymore. It's time to let go of these and this book really made me want to get up and do some decluttering myself. 
""But through your course on how to put my space in order, I realised for the first time that letting go is even more important than adding.""
Most of what she says made total sense to me and at times it's funny to hear her talking about tidying up in such a passionate manner. You can tell she lives for what she's doing. The only issue I have is how the aspect of buying more things hasn't been addressed. I guess it's not Marie Kondō's job to tell us what to spend our money on, but the sole fact that we all own and buy way too much stuff makes me almost sad. I feel like just throwing all that crap away is not necessarily enough, but what we should aim for is more consciousness about what we consume or acquire in general. This is definitely a great and motivating book for people who feel like their homes could do well with a bit of decluttering. It certainly gives you that little extra push and guidance you need to actually do it."
207,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13036247-diana,Rating 3 out of 5,"There are things in this book that I wholeheartedly AGREE with. Such as:“I believe, however, that it is best to tidy up quickly and get it over with. Why? Because tidying is not the purpose of life.” (Then, after the author explains that tidying is her passion.) “As for you, pour your time and passion into what brings you the most joy, your mission in life.”But there are also things in this book that I wholeheartedly DISAGREE with. Such as:(Referring to discarding from your book collection) “Let’s face it. In the end, you are going to read very few of your books again.” and “There is no meaning in their just being on your shelves.”Personally, I do reread my books from time to time. Also, I love being able to lend books to friends and family. Basically, I’m NEVER going to go through my books in the way this book wants me to. If you want advice for decluttering and organizing, this book has some information that may help you. However, you would need to read it with an open mind as Kondo has some ideas that are kind of different, such as thanking your hand bag at the end of each day, greeting your home out loud when you enter, and such. All in all, some helpful advice. Some I ignored, some I may practice."
208,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41583-rebecca,Rating 5 out of 5,"I loved this book! I've been enjoying decluttering books for a while (the less you buy, the more money you have, the less you have to clean, maintain, store, etc.), but this takes a more psychological than numerical or storage approach. A lot of reviewers seem to make fun of the author for her spiritual style and beliefs that objects are alive, but I kind of think along these lines anyway, so it worked for me for the most part. At the very least, I think it encourages reverent thinking about what you interact with, which is important in creating a respected, frugal, nondisposable world. “We should be choosing what we want to keep, not what we want to get rid of.” (p. 41)“Every object has a different role to play. Not all clothes have come to you to be worn threadbare. It is the same with people. Not every person you meet in life will become a close friend or lover. Some you will find hard to get along with or impossible to like. But these people, too, teach you the precious lesson of who you DO like, so that you will appreciate those special people even more.  When you come across something that you cannot part with, think carefully about its true purpose in your life. You’ll be surprised at how many of the things you possess have already fulfilled their role. By acknowledging their contribution and letting them go with gratitude, you will be able to truly put the things you own, and your life, in order. In the end, all that will remain are the things that you really treasure.” (p. 60-61)“You may have wanted to read it when you bought it, but if you haven’t read it by now, the book’s purpose was to teach you that you didn’t need it.” (p. 91)“When they explain why they hang onto them, their answers are all about what they intend to do “someday.”...If you haven’t done what you intended to do yet, donate or recycle that book. Only by discarding it will you be able to test how passionate you are about that subject.” (p. 92)“It is not our memories but the person we have become because of those past experiences that we should treasure. This is the lesson these keepsakes teach us when we sort them. The space in which we live should be for the person we are becoming now, not for the person we were in the past.” (118)“Don’t underestimate the “noise” of written information (labels, ads, etc)” (166)“Although we can get to know ourselves better by sitting down and analyzing our characteristics or by listening to others’ perspectives on us, I believe that tidying is the best way. After all, our possessions very accurately relate the history of the decisions we have made in life. Tidying is a way of taking stock that shows us what we really like.” (176-177)“One of the magical effects of tidying is confidence in your decision-making capacity.” (178)“The question of what you want to own is actually the question of how you want to live your life. Attachment to the past and fears concerning the future not only govern the way you select the things you own but also represent the criteria by which you make choices in every aspect of your life, including your relationships with people and your job.” (182)"

Capirete dunque la mia eccitazione nel leggere che con il metodo Konami (quello di cui si parla nel libro) basta ordinare una volta per poi non farlo mai più. Il problema (doveva esserci l'inghippo da qualche parte) è che la Kondō ti dice di buttare via gran parte di quello che hai. Ora, due sono i modi con i quali porsi alla sua sfida: o un categorico no (- Col cavolo che butto libri, vestiti, fotografie e via dicendo!), o un timido forse. Ecco, il timido forse è quantomeno necessario per andare avanti nella lettura (a meno che non siate così sadici da voler leggere un libro che per 3/4 della sua lunghezza vi spiega come fare una cosa che non volete assolutamente fare). Apertura necessaria più che mai quando propone di strappare le pagine dei libri che più ci son piaciuti e incollarle in un raccoglitore, in modo da poter così buttare il resto del libro (proposta che per fortuna lei stessa boccia perché priva di senso).In sua difesa devo però dire che lei sottolinea ad ogni piè sospinto che bisogna buttare solo quello che non ci emoziona più. Ergo, ad una persona possono bastare dieci libri adorati sulla propria mensola, mentre un'altra si sentirebbe male a vederne meno di cento; sta a noi capire quando fermarci. Bisogna poi considerare che lei ha una visione particolare del mondo che la circonda: secondo le credenze scintoiste (di cui lei stessa è stata sacerdotessa per cinque anni tipo) anche gli oggetti inanimati hanno un'anima, possono comunicare con noi, trasmettere determinate sensazioni e vibrazioni spirituali. Se buttate una giacca che non mettete mai, in realtà non la state letteralmente buttando, bensì la state congedando, la sua energia tornerà nell'universo e poi ritornerà da voi sotto un'altra forma perché vi ha voluto bene. Ecco, se voi non credete minimante in questo, allora metà del libro vi sembrerà il delirio di un folle che a fine giornata ringrazia calzini e maglioni per il lavoro svolto.Sinceramente? Io credo che proverò il suo metodo. Spero che oltre ad alleggerire la mia stanza riesca soprattutto ad aiutarmi a non comprare impulsivamente cose inutili di cui mi pento appena tornata a casa. "
210,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41410850-yuki,Rating 1 out of 5,"Hard to rate. Some parts Kondō offers very rational-sounding tips, while in other parts she sounds like a delusional and arrogant consultant (translation errors maybe?). The psychological effects of post-cleaning period that Kondō describes in this book, though some can be explained by placebo effect and others, are quite unbelievable.Tidying dramatically changes one's life. This is true for everyone, 100 percent.I know Kondō isn't a psychologist nor did she wrote this book about psychological effects of cleaning, but making claims without crediting source is a big no-no for me.I would not recommend this for the general American audiences, however, because American homes (on average) are huge. If you've got such a house and not a tiny apartment, you don't need this book unless you want to pursue Kondō's minimalistic lifestyle.Back to Kondō's methods, they are quite useful actually, though I understand that her methods on books can be quite enraging to book lovers. But if you are such a literature lover, feel free to skip that part. To follow such method (using intuition to choose the things to keep / asking ときめく？) will likely lead to a lifestyle similar to that of Kondō, and if you desired it, I don't see why not even though she absolutely has no concept of archiving whatsoever.About the translation: The translation is not quite good, for me. Or maybe it is just me with my inability to comprehend Imperial measurements, but why don't the translator just keep the original measurements and then add footnotes? Some parts seem very America-centric, and not in a good way. "

This is especially helpful if you've never really thought about the act of tidying up before. The cornerstone of the KonMari method is knowing when to throw items away. I grew up in a household that discouraged throwing personal items away (quite possibly because my parents grew up in third world countries) so it was liberating to understand that I can, and should, throw away items that I realistically have no more use for. This was the most important concept that I learned from the book. Marie Kondo makes a comparison between items you acquire and people you meet throughout your life. Not every person you meet will become a best friend or a romantic partner, but they nevertheless fulfill important roles your life. In a similar way, items we acquire aren't always going to be used to their fullest potential. Not every piece of clothing will be worn to its limits - in some cases an item's ""purpose"" has been fulfilled simply by acquiring it (impulse buy at a store). In these cases, it should be acceptable to part with the item.Maybe this is just a complicated way of coping with buyers remorse but I definitely have improved the tidiness of my living space after reading this book."

The cover is so pretty and, initially, made me feel a calming peace while taking in the gorgeous sky. Oh, but we must never judge a book by its cover. I found the author's tone condescending and dogmatic. The advice given in this book will simply not work for my family mainly because we don’t speak to our personal belongings. I feel as though this lifestyle is for single people, living on their own. There were no practical applications for a young family that has toys, baby gear, hobbies, or sporting goods to name a few. I want to live in a home, not a shrine or a museum. Sure, I “ball my socks” rather than let them relax and stretch out because I’m ungrateful for them supporting me all day. Oopsie. I also want my children to learn that they have their own personal space (bedrooms) that they are responsible for and no other family member will barge into their room in an OCD cleaning frenzy.We live in a clean and pretty tidy home for a busy family. Sure, we have days that I pray no one unexpectedly drops in, but if they do, they are welcome to join in on the fun!"
213,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I've read an awful lot of books on coping with and eliminating clutter. At one point, the books themselves became part of the clutter. While there are several bits of advice that I could never use -- empty your purse every evening? keep your books in a closet? -- the main message of the ""KonMarie"" method seems to me to be universal. Keep only what sparks joy in you. Take each and every item in hand, ask yourself if it sparks joy, and if it does, keep it. If it doesn't, thank it for its service and send it on its way. After you're done, your home will be filled only with things that make you happy. While I was reading, and starting this process in my mind, I realized that I have been keeping a drawing table that I've never used, for that ""someday"". Meanwhile, I keep bumping into it every time I go to bed or have to get to the closet. It's not sparking any joy, only guilt. Off it goes to the thrift shop next week.Another message that struck a chord with me was this: keeping things that don't spark joy is about one of two things -- clinging to the past, or fear of the future. And both of those keep us from living in the present."

The principle driving Kondo's book is that you should pick up every, single, blessed item in your house, and if it doesn't ""spark joy,"" then you should toss it. Given that I have a tendency to accumulate things, that's good advice, and in the past couple of days, I've donated seven bags of books to the local library. So--all to the good. Other aspects of the book, though, are a little too fanciful for me. As much as I might like my handbag or my shoes, I won't be thanking them every night for a job well done, nor will I wish them a good night's rest. Anthropomorphism aside, this isn't a bad guide for decluttering all the bits and pieces and starting the New Year fresh. "

Unfortunately, much of the stuff in here I wouldn’t call sane! But to each his own.Still, I scoured this looking for tips I could use, but came away with nothing.

By that I mean that most of these type books that I have read really do not have any new or extremely interesting innovations. Some are written better than others, some arranged in better order than others, some cover some areas that others do not, but basically all this type of book does is reiterate cleaning and/or storing methods that we all already know about. Seldom does one of these books actually have a new idea or method. I found this particular book to be a bit scattered in logic. It seemed to go from one idea to another fairly rapidly and from one particular item needing to be uncluttered to another before investing enough time in each area. Then in other sections it tended to over emphasize and dwell on other areas. I was not completely put off by this book, because it did mention areas that are not always highlighted in other 'clean it up' books. Keeping and storing books - read or unread, is not a usual topic of this type book. There was a nice, but small, portion on books in one of their chapters. I do disagree with some of this books practices however. They say that tidying every day creates a problem. Maybe they meant, what I call, deep cleaning. If you don't 'tidy' everyday doesn't your house become a mess? Maybe it is the verbiage that I have a problem with? I also do not ""talk"" to my clothes. I do not ""talk"" to my empty house upon arriving home. I do not talk to inanimate items. When my socks decide to answer me, I may change my mind, but until then I plan to keep my sanity. This may be a custom for others, but for myself this is not happening. I also question the method of putting EVERYTHING of one type item on the floor to go through. This book suggests you take ALL your clothes out of every closet and put them in the middle of the floor. Then take each piece in your hands and make the decision if it is worth keeping or passing on to either someone else or the trash. Empty every closet? NO! To me this seems totally irrational and makes a lot of extra work. If I can't open a closet, look at an article of clothing and make a decision from there, then I don't need to 'tidy'. This practice is not only for clothing, but for everything. Imagine taking all your books from their shelves and putting them in the middle of the floor. It would take me three days to re-shelf them. Again, not a practical way for me to de-clutter. "

Ich habe während des Hörens schon ausgemistet und werde weitermachen! Einige Notizen zum Buch habe ich mir auch gemacht um diese Denkanstöße weiter zu verfolgen und beim „Ausmistprojekt“ zu nutzen!Negativ aufgefallen ist mir allerdings dass sie zu 99% vom Wegschmeißen spricht. Da werden Massen an Müllsäcken produziert. Nachhaltig ist das nicht! Und wirtschaftlich auch nicht! Ich werde weiterhin noch gute Sachen lieber verkaufen und spenden statt sie zu vernichten!

227,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6115184-frances,Rating 5 out of 5,"I bought this book on my Kindle months ago because it looked interesting but then my life got even more cluttered, I saw a lot of hype, read some fantastic posts by Jujusprinkles and thought 'wait, I own this book!' and got reading. Then I turned into one of those people who talks about how the KonMari method 'changed their life' before they've even started. Seriously, this book will change how you see your possessions. You may also start saying 'seriously' a lot. 
Pros
• Marie is really likeable. I didn't find her condescending, which self help books often are• This approach makes so much sense to me. I own things I don't even like and that's silly• It seems to actually work
Cons
• I'm a sentimental hoarder and sometimes I don't like being made to look at that too closely• Marie often refers to 'throwing things away' she does mention donating and giving things to people but for a recycler like me, someone suggesting you throw a book away is sacrilege Little bit of an explanation, for the uninitiated, Marie Kondo is a Japanese Cleaning Consultant. She helps people make the best use of the space they have by clearing out all of their clutter. She's very popular in Japan and so this book was translated for the English speaking market.Marie calls her style of tidying 'KonMari' a mashup of her names. The method stems from Marie spending years of her life tidying (because she loved being tidy) but feeling like she was never getting anywhere. Mess goes out, mess comes in but still there would be clutter. Then she realised that if she got rid of unnecessary things in one fell swoop (that swoop can last about six months, it's about dedicating yourself to it) the change would be so dramatic she'd never revert to clutter. The method, in its purest form, starts with you gathering everything from a category in one place. Literally everything of one type that you own so if that's books, every single one of your books in one room on the floor. She suggest you start with clothes and if you have too many to gather, you gather the categories like all of your coats or all of your trousers. Then, to cut a long story short, you pick up each item individually and decide if it brings you joy. That's it. Not 'Ooo, it was a present and I never wear it but I feel so guilty for donating it' or 'I only just bought this but in hindsight it was a mistake so I'll hold onto it until an acceptable amount of time has passed'. The KonMari method strictly tells you that your possessions should bring you joy and if they make you feel sad or guilty or angry or bored or anxious then what is it doing in your house? For those wondering, she does cover paperwork. Obviously going digital is a great option but for the things you have to hold on to for legal reasons, the joy is found in the peace of mind you get from owning them. Any really old bills or statements can be shredded. To sum up, one of my favourite quotes ever is: If your possession happens to be both, even better. Hello future KitchenAidThe Konmari method is almost a reduction of those two into one word: Joy. My favourite quote from 'The life-changing magic of tidying up' was:  
""There are three approaches we can take towards our possessions. Face them now, face them sometime, or avoid them until we die""
That really stuck with me. I've known people who actually have avoided their possessions until they died. Then someone else has to deal with your emotionally charged belongings.You possessions don't politely see themselves out. At some point that jar of elastic bands or that mystery drawer are going to have to be confronted otherwise you're going to be skirting around them forever.On a positive note, Marie showed me what life could one day be like in a home where everything has a place, where the answer to 'what should I do today ?' isn't 'probably tidy that up' - a home where every single item makes you happy and that sounds pretty magical.Edit 15/6/17 - Quick reread to refresh my motivation. I own the beautiful hardback now. This is inspiring every time I read it. I always start decluttering anew afterwards. It's going to be a while before I'm there but definitely on the way"
228,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19993-robin,Rating 5 out of 5,"Marie Kondo is not a force of nature, but a force of psychology. She has channeled what for some might have darkened into a debilitating mental illness into a superpower: the superpower of tidying. She is the best example of eudaimonia I have ever encountered. Every page of this book is a poignant joy and you will want to share it with everyone you know.I've held off on reviewing this book because I strayed quickly from the directive to perform the tidying in a contained period of several days and have not managed to finish, as some of my possessions and much of my floor space is inaccessible to me at the present time due to a construction project. I made it through clothes and books (so many books!) and can share my experiences there:1. Putting all the clothes that you own in one big pile at the same time is a very powerful thing. It helps a great deal to see the aggregate and take a volume reading, so don't be tempted to just pull out one category of clothing at a time, as it wouldn't be the same. Do, however, try to pile things in categories so it will be easier to go through them category by category.2. Putting clothes away per the Kondo method is harder than it sounds. Life lesson learned: I am not good at folding things into shapes that will stand vertically in a drawer. Good luck with that.3. Kondo's book advice didn't really apply to me, as the ideal, tidy home environment that she asks one to envision before beginning is, for me, practically wallpapered with books. I'm not necessarily keeping books because I am going to read them again (though I certainly do that on occasion) but because they are precious to me as objects. I collect them, I read them, I shelve them, I move them around to different shelves, I lend them out, I give them away, I buy them again. This is the book-filled life that I want, so while a shoe rack of books by the front door may be just fine for Marie Kondo, that would never work for me. All that said, I did take every single book in the house off the shelves and pile them in the living room, dust them, greet them, and decide whether any could be let go into the world. (This took two full days. FULL days.) I did decide to pass many on to other readers, mostly by bringing them down in bunches of three or four to the little free lending library in the newspaper stands outside the Whole Foods on 24th street. It is very gratifying to see that every time I bring down a new batch, the ones I had left before had been discovered and adopted by neighbors. 4. I can testify to the truthfulness of Kondo's assurance that if you let things go the right way, you don't regret it. I haven't wanted anything back that I have donated, and I also haven't been immediately tempted to run out and buy a lot of new clothes. (I will not say books, because I always feel like buying more books. Can't be helped.)I'm looking forward to working through my remaining categories later this year. And then buying more bookshelves.

229,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6074441-beth,Rating 4 out of 5,"After finishing the manga version of this book, I almost immediately picked up a copy of the original, translated from the Japanese, and tore through it in a day and a half. The best thing Ms. Kondo has done for me with her book, bar none, is provide an approach to tidying up that accounts for both practicality--i.e. finite space--and one's attachment to the items in that space, both in the negative and positive senses of it. There's a wonderful optimism to the idea of keeping only what you love, that makes creating a thriving home environment from the unpromising clay of roomfuls of cruft and clutter something to look forward to, rather than an anticipated burden. One of the first questions asked by the book is: what do you want from your home life? Everyone has their own answer to this question, and I am convinced the KonMari method is versatile enough to accommodate my own answer, and, given this book's popularity, many others'.The animistic approach to household items (of whatever kind) was hit-or-miss for me; as with all self-help books, there are going to be parts where your point of view and the self-help guru's don't mesh, and you have to decide for yourself whether those differences make the whole thing fall apart. In my opinion, the basic concept of keeping only things that you genuinely appreciate is a sound one, regardless of how exactly that's expressed. It isn't too difficult to translate these parts into Pragmatese, for those who value ""rationality.""With the awareness that items with more emotional baggage are the most difficult to make decisions about, I'll be taking things in a slightly different order than is suggested. Kondo's order is clothing, books, papers, miscellany, and sentimental items. Mine will be clothing, papers, miscellany, amusements/entertainment (books, games, and puzzles), sentimental items. As an introvert whose life at home is most happily spent with a book or game, I anticipate it being more difficult to decide which of those to keep than, say, electronics manuals or old bills, by several orders of magnitude.Regardless of anything else, these two books have shown me that it is possible for our near-""Hoarders""-level heap of amassed possessions to transform into the ornaments of a pleasing, neat home. Even better, they've shown that the tools to do it have been with me all along. And I don't just mean garbage bags."

Sorting by items rather than location, only keeping items that ""spark joy"" and organizing in one fell swoop rather than over any given period of time her method has gained quite a momentum recently. Boasting benefits beyond that of a clean house, this is a guide to organize your life as well.In truth I picked this book because I was just too curious as to what it said (given all the publicity it has had recently), not because I was interested in adopting the method. I have watched the Netflix show and seen a bunch of memes online so I picked this book up. Marie Kondo does offer good tips such as not keeping items you do not use and sticking to essentials. Having said that, I had a hard time taking this book seriously. First off, the words 'tidy', tidying up' or 'tidied' were use in excess for such a short book. Moreover, I do not want to hear 'spark joy' for a while. I am probably in the minority here but I just can not get behind this concept as not everything is special, most is practical. I knew this book was not for me when I read the following line: ""If you are a woman, try wearing something elegant as nightwear."" Miss Kondo does not believe in loungewear as you should be able to wear inside what you wear outside. Do not know about her, but for me, changing into sweatpants at the end of the day is one of life's greatest pleasures. Now, that gives me joy. I am clearly not the target audience for I actually love to do laundry and fold clothes, I am organized and neat (my space is not pristine but its clean and mostly clear) and periodically I go through my things and donate what I do not use. Assigning feelings to things did seem odd (this coming from me, a person that cherishes my books among my most valuable belongings). It is difficult enough to deal with human emotions, I do not have time to dwell on wether my socks are upset becauseI balled them up. All and all, this was quite interesting.Did this book spark joy? "
231,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18879487-joaquin-garza,Rating 4 out of 5,"Buena parte del atractivo principal del libro de Kondo es que viene más o menos dentro de esta ola del minimalismo contemporáneo. Y a mí me parece bastante bien con eso. Lo que le añade más valor es lo práctico que resulta y, si bien uno puede estar o no de acuerdo con ideas particulares de Kondo, sí nos presenta un enfoque novedoso para tener la casa limpia.No siento que la necesite yo tanto como la necesitan mis papás (ja!). Pero sí había hecho una limpieza relativamente grande de ropa a principio de año... ahora sé que tengo que hacer más y tirar todos los komonos que no uso (la mitad de las conservas en mi alacena, la mitad del pantry del baño, etc.). Una consideración importante por supuesto es que aquí no es Japón y hay muchas cosas que es mucho más humano llevar a instituciones que las ocupen en lugar de tirarlas.Lo que ha generado más polémica es el tema de los libros. Los bibliófilos que más han protestado contra Kondo son aquellos que tienen un problema con la afirmación que la autora hace de pasada (y nunca como recomendación concreta) de quedarse sólo con un número reducido de éstos. Dicen que los libros no siempre deben darnos alegría, sino también cuestionarnos y que nuestras impresiones sobre éstos cambian a medida de que cambie el tiempo. Ustedes hagan lo que quieran y santa paz: nada más no los tengan apilados por todos lados sin ningún tipo de control.Como es normal, los quirks de Kondo nos parecen extraños y ajenos, relativamente freakish y muy a tono con la fama que tiene Japón como proveedor de manías y momentos de WTF para todos los demás. En este caso, mucho tiene que ver con su práctica de agradecer a sus cosas por su servicio y realizar rituales sintoístas antes de ordenar la casa. Cuando uno se va a los libros de minimalismo, estas prácticas son las que más chocan con la idea de desprenderse mentalmente de las posesiones sin fijarnos en este tema de la felicidad. Como sea. El enfoque de Kondo es uno más para ayudarnos a enfocarnos en las cosas que importan y quitarnos la cabeza de las cosas que no. Anoche me sorprendí doblando mi ropa cuidadosamente antes de echarla en el cesto de la ropa sucia y agradecerle a mi casa por ser tan acogedora (después de diez días de vacaciones)."

I often just queue/request books from the library and they show up; sometimes I can't remember where I got the idea to read a particular book. In any case, I started reading this book. . . and kept reading it despite how odd I found it!To be fair, I don't think I'm the target audience for this book. I already love tidying up, and am pretty vigilant about getting rid of things on a regular basis. Now, do I pick up each item and ask myself, ""does this spark joy?"" and thank said item for its service? No. I definitely don't do that. Like diets, I think people are always looking for a silver bullet for organizing, and I totally get that. But, boy--this book is so odd! I just couldn't stop reading it despite the fact that I'm not totally sure Kondo's methods totally make sense to me. Here are a few choice quotes: ""This is the routine I follow every day when I return from work. I unlock the door and announce to my house, ""I'm home!"" PIcking up the shoes I wore yesterday and left out in the entranceway, I say, ""Thank you very much for your hard work,"" and put them away in the shoe cupboard""(There's a lot of talking to inanimate objects in this book!)""In fact, to go through life without knowing how to fold is a huge loss.""""I strongly recommend folding as the main storage method. But it's a pain to fold clothes and put them away in the drawer. It's much easier to pop them on a hanger and stick them in the closet.  If that's what you're thinking, then you haven't discovered the true impact of folding.""""Never, ever ball up your socks. . . that's right. The socks and stockings stored in your drawer are essentially on holiday.""(There's a LOT of advice around folding.)Judging from the high reader score for this book, I'm clearly in the minority thinking that this book is strange and full of bizarre advice. That said, I couldn't stop reading it!"

It's not the first time I lived on my own, but it's the first time that it wasn't for school, so I guess that makes it feel more ""real."" And I am still slowly going through my stuff and I've been using a lot of these methods (before reading this book!). I'm using simple storage methods and trying to get rid of stuff. I don't know if I'm ready to go full in on getting rid of everything (and there's an element to privilege to this, I think. I can't always afford to only buy things that bring me joy).She makes her method sound pretty attractive and raises some good points, like that the act of making decisions about each one of your possessions and deliberately choosing what to keep can make it easier to make decisions in other aspects of your life. And my space has made me unhappy with its untidiness, so I can believe a lot of what she says.I think the point I appreciate most and will try hardest to remember is that items you bought and never used DID have a use in your life, like maybe teaching you, ""Oh, I don't like that style of clothes."" Goodness know I've felt guilty about those kinds of purchases. And that maybe sometimes the purpose was the joy buying the thing brought you.I wish she'd addressed more how to get rid of things, though. I don't feel comfortable trashing things that still have use, even if they don't have use to ME.(I think I would not be an entirely successful graduate of the program, though. I am still storing things that probably don't entirely qualify as ""bringing joy."" And she would not approve of my book collection!!!)"

Found myself in a store waffling between two computer mice. I held them in my hand and asked if they bring joy, after the install I verified I had chosen correctly.  The realizations came in waves. Clothes were easy. I thought I had finished books, but I kept going back to them as if I wasn't satisfied. I deeply considered my relationship with my books and found peace. Do as she says and keep doing it. I listened to the audiobook several times and approached it as a radical departure from old behavior, as one pursues a new spiritual teaching or when determined to lose a bad habit.  I can't say my one big tidy is complete, but I overcame procrastination in so many areas that I am confident I will get there. For example: in grouping like things I started a bike bag, then installed all the parts I had acquired and tuned them up. I had these parts for six months without bothering, yet when I installed them it increased my enjoyment. Life changed: Bob's your uncle!"

Things like - you should ask your clothes whether they prefer to be hanged, you should greet your house and thank your bag. You should never ever fold your socks because they can't rest this way. It was hilarious :D A bit too much for me. I really hated that she advised throwing everything away and not donating it. I expected better but it made me want to clean so I guess it did its job. "

247,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30274173-colleen,Rating 1 out of 5,"1 StarI hated this book. I honestly went into it with an open mind. I nodded along with the first couple of pages. Yes, we have too much clutter in our lives, too much useless junk. Yes, I feel less stressed when I am in an organized environment. But any agreement quickly evaporated. Because Marie Kondo is one of the most insufferable authors I have EVER had the displeasure of experiencing!!! I tried at first to rationalize that some of this was due to bad translation of the book and to be mindful of cross-cultural differences. But in the end, it seems that she is just that condescending, narcissistic, and frankly bat-shit-crazy. By the time I got to the part where she describes ripping up her books to only keep pages with quotes she likes, I knew there was no hope for this book to be anything other than headache inducing. I am not trying to make light of mental illness, believe me. This author seems seriously unstable. She clearly has severe OCD. She mentions panic attacks, nervous breakdowns, social isolation, family issues, fainting from being so overwhelmed by clutter, and more. Luckily she has found a career where she can market her obsessive neatness and charge a boatload of money for her officiousness. I probably should not mention it, but I kept thinking of the TV show ""Monk"" where an OCD man uses his acute attention to detail to solve crimes. It does not seem that Kondo actually dealt with any of her issues; she just channeled them into something else in an epic display of displacement. She claims that once you purge your worldly possessions everything else in your life - from your health to your relationships - will essentially fix themselves. One of the oddest things was that she claims that purging your possessions will lead to your body trying to purge itself. She says that this most commonly manifests itself into immediate explosive diarrhea. That's right. She proudly proclaims that her life philosophy leads to 
explosive diarrhea
. I am not even kidding. In my mind, the only thing that should ever happily claim to cause diarrhea is anti-constipation medicine. The ""Konmarie"" method (the name she gives to it, gag) is completely unoriginal. It is a hodgepodge of different theories and ideas that she mixed together and claimed to originate. But really she just wrapped it up into a popular package. Take for example, her method of folding clothes. It is not new, and it certainly was not created by her. I've been folding clothes like that since middle school and I most definitely did not learn it from her.Kondo brags incessantly about her how NONE of her clients relapse. Why? Well, despite the repeated brags about how successful her program is, there is only one tiny mention of the caveat of this success: none of the people who successfully complete the program relapse into messiness. However, part of ""completing"" her program is achieving a state of mind that prohibits clutter. If you relapse then you obviously did not achieve the correct mental status needed to join the cult, ergo you did not truly complete her program ergo her relapse rate can never be anything other than zero percent. Smart. From a marketing point of view, this is admittedly quite genius. The one thing I will give her props for is that she is clearly good at selling her package. And you know what, if you use this and it actually helps you, more power to you. But I can't see anything other than prettily packaged bullshit - a combination of old ideas and life philosophies that she mashed together and claimed to have come up with all on her own and is now sitting back to suck the money out of. Not that she seemed to need the money anyway. Reading between the lines, she must come from a rich family. She talks about the four bedroom she up in in Japan. (Do you know how expensive real estate is in Japan?!) She talks about her many, many shopping sprees followed by purging everything in some sort of unhealthy shopping bulimia. And now she is even richer. This is not someone who has ever had to over come the post Great Depression mentality of keeping things because you might need them and can't avoid to buy new things that is so commonly passed down generations. There is nothing in this book about fiscal responsibility. Kondo says that the joy comes from buying the possessions not from actually having them. Basically that you might as well throw them away immediately because you already got all the enjoyment from them that you are going to get. She contradicts herself and is suspiciously cagey about certain things. Like she says that she is horrified when she thinks about how she used to throw out family members' possessions without permission, but then she subtly tells readers to do that very thing. The tone of the entire book is self-righteous, conceited, highhanded, and manipulative.She advocates that all of your objects are sentient and want to be useful to you, but that if they no longer bring you joy to toss them in the trash so that they can be reincarnated into new objects that exist to please you. It felt like some horrible acid trip version of ""The Brave Little Toaster."" Like your possessions are wasting away from depression because you don't love them enough. Clearly the only solution is to murder them in the trash shoot so that they can be reborn into new objects which will then slave away towards your happiness until such time that they once again cease to bring you joy. Then you can murder them again. Ahem, I mean, release them to be reborn.Nope, not drinking that Kool-Aid. Any usefulness was obliterated by the sheer overwhelming highhandedness of the author. This book did not inspire ANY joy in me. It did inspire a malicious desire to shove the author into a Costco and force her to watch Americans bulk buy useless junk until her brain overloads and short circuits into a molten lump of smugness and smoking wires. So it will probably be for the best if I avoid ever reading anything by her ever again. I'm not saying that other people will find this book as infuriating and useless as I did. You might want to pick it up if, you know... you have a strong desire for diarrhea-inducing self-righteousness.

248,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/104090874-omar,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was much better than I thought it was going to be. There is a respect that Marie shows towards our living spaces that is quite endearing. The 'life-changing magic' comes not from tidying our homes, but detoxing those elements in our psyche that may be attached to things that are holding us back from thinking more clearly about what brings us joy in our lives. It's all about joy. When you have your house in order it has ripple effects on all areas of your life. On her actual method for tidying, the big takeaway for me is to do everything at once and to treat it like an event. Once you experience the results you'll see what the difference is emotionally/psychologically and it will raise raise your standard of living. It's essential work towards well-being. It's sort of like a commitment to being fit and eating healthy---once you see the difference you won't want to go back. The one thing that I disagree with though is striving for perfection as that's unrealistic in the long-term and may lead to obsessive compulsive behaviour."

I have been on a journey towards minimalism for years and so this book has fascinated me for about as long. After having recently come across Marie Kondo's new series on Netflix my interest has doubled. Seeing her in ""action"" has given me a new level of appreciation for the ideas included in this book. In my prior research I found, as I have said, mixed reviews. Some found her quirky and ""new age"" while others were truly inspired and delighted, and it is this later camp I find myself in. Her book does a good job of explaining the various aspects of her ""method"", as well as concrete reasons for them (based on years of personal experience). I think everyone should read this because it is my humble belief that there is a lot of something in here for everyone."
252,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/283407-crowinator,Rating 3 out of 5,"I didn't read this self-help book because I need help with tidying. (It's my wife that has this problem, and this book hasn't given me any strategies to force her to put her clothes in the laundry basket instead of on the floor in front of the laundry basket or to put her keys on the key hook by the front door instead of wherever she happens to set them down first.) I read it because it suddenly shot up the holds list at my library, causing my co-worker to purchase more copies and both of us to wonder what everybody was getting out of this serene-looking little book.Maybe it is the almost hypnotic calm of the author that makes it so appealing. Certainly a lot of the advice she gives on keeping your spaces clutter-free and keeping only objects that bring you joy is both practical and uplifting, though I take issue with her coy claim that tidying your space will clear up your skin or help you lose weight or get you a date. (Well, maybe that last one if your space is filthy right now.) I can see how living in a space that makes you happy and not stressed out can improve how you feel and therefore, how you act, especially if you are one of those people stressed out by a spouse who accumulates, over a couple days, six pairs of shoes in the entryway directly in the path of anyone who has to enter or leave your home.Yes, I could step over them, and yes, I could remember that after tripping over them every day. There is a process you will have to go through to get the people you live with on board with the idea of a massive purge over several days, followed by always putting things in their place after use. Should you make them read this book? Should you just give them the highlights (i.e., marching orders)? Should you just tidy your own stuff and hope they are inspired by you? (This is the author's recommendation.) The idea that going through this process will make everyone magically tidy for life is hard to swallow, though I like the author's assurances that this will happen once they see and feel what their home could be like. Really, this book could work wonders for those who live alone or who are the unchallenged dictators of their household. It could work for me and my wife, too, if we were ready to commit to a big change, and if we weren't having too much fun mocking the idea of anthropomorphizing our possessions by imaging their sadness at being passed over for that cuter thing, or angry at being left in a pile all over the floor, or happy to be given a place to belong when they're not ""in service"". (I will admit that when I was a child, I used to believe that the portable fans we used in summer would come alive and shred my face at night. This book makes me wonder: Why were they so murderous? Were they too dusty?)I don't think the book is useless. One of my co-workers was just telling me about her son, who lives with a room-mate in a tiny apartment, and how he used this book to simplify his life and clear up his space and loved it. I like that the book made me look around at where I live and really think about all my stuff (and our stuff) and how I feel about it. It did inspire me to go through some areas of my home that have been stressing me out for a while. And it gave me some strategies to think about objects that I always have trouble with, like my clothes and book collection.So, it was worth it to read and think about, even if I won't be adopting the method at this moment in life. And oh yeah, by the way, I still don't own a portable fan. "

Sie erzählt selbst, wie sie schon in ihrer Jugend lieber aufgeräumt hat, als zu spielen und ihre Familie mit diversen (heimlichen) Wegwerfaktionen terrorisiert hat.Auch ihre tägliche Routine... jeden Tag soll die Handtasche ausgeräumt werden und der Inhalt unterm Bett verstaut werden, während die Tasche in Plöastik eingehüllt und mit Papier ausgestopft ins Regal kommt.Ich finde, sie ist auch sehr radikal, was das Wegwerfen angeht. Ungelesenen Bücher gehören ihrer Meinung nach entsorgt, sollte man sie doch irgendwann lesen wollen, könne man sie ja neu kaufen. Ok, bei Büchern bin ich wohl auch nicht der Durchschnittstyp...Aaaber... das Buch liest sich flott und ist total faszinierend, auch wenn ich vieles zu extrem fand, ihre Grundaussage, sich nur und ausschließlich mit Dingen zu umgeben, die man liebt (und hierzu gehören auch die kleinen Haushaltshelfer, die einem das Leben leichter machen und die man in dem Moment vielleicht wirklich „liebt“.).Das radikal umzusetzen ist schwierig und bis ins letzte Detail auch gar nicht nötig, aber mal mit aufmerksamem Blick die Dinge zu sichten, die man besitzt und sich wirklich zu fragen, warum man etwas aufgehoben hat, ist schon sinnvoll. Ich habe festgestellt, dass einiges einfach deshalb noch da ist, weil ich es irgendwann ganz toll fand und danach ein schlechtes Gewissen hatte, dass die Begeisterung abgeflaut war, ich es aber irgendwann unbedingt besitzen wollte. Oder Geschenke, die man aus schlechtem Gewissen dem Schenkenden gegenüber irgendwie nie aussortiert hatte, obwohl es gar nicht mehr zum eigenen Stil passt.Ich habe selbst schon voller Elan begonnen, auszumisten und es fühlt sich herrlich an, so vieles ist doch einfach Ballast, der Platz wegnimmt. Was mir nicht so gut gefällt, ist die Tatsache, dass sie alles „wegwirft“, da gibt es heute bessere Methoden und sei es nur das Sozialkaufhaus, das gerne Spenden annimmt, mit etwas Zeit und Energie kann man auch vieles noch verkaufen. (Aber Vorsicht! Ausgemusterte Dinge nur verschenken, wenn der Beschenkte vorher explizit geäußert hat, dass er sich so etwas bald kaufen will, sonst lädt man nach der Meinung der Autorin seinen Ballast nur einer anderen Person auf, die sich verpflichtet fühlt, das Geschenk anzunehmen.Zum Teil ist das Buch auch unfreiwillig komisch und man fragt sich wirklich, was für ein Charakter von sich selbst sagt, dass sie fast nur ans Aufräumen denkt.Das Buch lohnt sich, aber man kann ihre zentralen Punkte, die sich eigentlich nur immer wieder wiederholen auch getrost kompakt nachlesen und sehen, was es einem bringt."
255,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62575136-lee-osborne,Rating 1 out of 5,"Oh dear.This book was a well-intentioned gift from a loved one, and it's taken me a year to get around to reading it. I shouldn't have bothered.I'll try to be positive - it does contain some useful ideas, and it's inspired me to declutter and sort things out. I moved house a year ago and much of my stuff is still in boxes. I'm aware that I have quite a big task ahead and I'm keen to tackle it. Her encouragement to discard a lot of things is sensible. But...This book reads like the ramblings of a lunatic. For all her talk of tidying and organisation bringing joy, I don't think I've ever read a book by someone who comes across as so devoid of personality. Her life sounds miserable, ascetic and boring - she's elevated tidying to some sort of deranged cult. She's been obsessed with it for her whole life, and she comes across as a tragic figure. She also strikes me as judgemental and sanctimonious, looking down on messy people as lesser human beings About 80% of the book is nonsensical woo. Talking to your possessions and acting like they're alive, FFS! The amount of emotional energy she invests in this stuff is ridiculous. She also claims that the results of tidying are almost supernatural and makes ridiculous claims about tidying bringing you good fortune. I have no doubt whatsoever that living in a clean and tidy home with quality stuff around you is way more pleasant and less stressful than living in a pigsty, but it doesn't make magical things happen. You need to be an insane masochist with absolutely nothing else going on in your life to gain anything from following the frequently crazy ideas in this book. The whole idea of only keeping items which ""spark joy"" sounds great but it doesn't even work. For example, she urges a ruthless approach to clothes. I dress almost entirely for comfort, but I work in an office so I need to own smart trousers and shirts. I HATE wearing them, but I can't get rid of them. She also urges extremely ruthless disposal of bank statements and payslips - has she ever tried applying for a mortgage without these things? Here in the UK we have no national ID cards - you need utility bills to join your local library! A lot of what she says reeks of sexism and a very old-fashioned approach. She comes across as some sort of 1950s housewife. I remain utterly unconvinced that average people have the time or the commitment to successfully apply this stuff. Seems to me she's just selling snake oil.My advice? Read ""How To Be Free"" (US title ""The Freedom Manifesto"") by Tom Hodgkinson instead, and learn to love your messy life. Have no time for Kondo's bordering-on-fascist nonsense."

This would be a 4.5 stars for me, because some passages are very redundant and repetitive - at least for me it did feel like half of the words were just to say one thing forty different ways. Sure, maybe some people do need the repetitiveness for the message to properly sink in, but it does feel a little frustrating after a while.Having said that, though, the other reason I loved this book so much is that it ""found"" me at the exactly right moment and time. I was already going through a de-cluttering/downsizing spree, but this helped me de-clutter and downsize even more and with more clarity and precision. I don't know what kind of effect this book has on someone, who is not in the ""right"" head space of thinking of slashing down their possession by at least a half. To me, it was a revelation in disguise. I knew some things that I wanted to get rid of, some I wanted to donate, some I wanted to sell in a huge yard sale, some I wasn't entirely sure about. Just for reference - I used to have 3 closets full of clothes that were so full, I could barely move the hangers to find the right clothes. Yet, I was only wearing about 1/3, if not less of all the items I owned. And I kept buying more, because I thought I had nothing to wear (the good ol' excuse), but still wasn't satisfied with most of the items hanging inside my closets. With getting rid of most of the clothes and only keeping the ones that really make me happy to wear, I am down to 1 closet (and only partially full one at that), while being perfectly happy with the amount and the content of my closet. I no longer feel the ""need"" to shop for more clothes, I am happy with what I already have. With the category of ""I am not sure what to do with this"" - that was the hardest category to crack, sort to speak. But this book could not make it any clearer and easier to figure out what to do with items that you are not sure if to keep or if to say ""thank you, next"". Marie Kondo is tidying guru and I cannot recommend to read and watch her show to really turn a fresh page and de-clutter, minimize your possessions to items that spark that joy in you and organize them in the best way possible. I guarantee that folding clothes has never been more fun and enjoyable as I find it now. And I used to dread folding, because I used to find it tedious and boring. Not anymore!!  "

If you diligently apply the KonMari method, sure, you'll own drastically fewer possessions and find them easier to keep neat. But it's hard work, not magic. The thing is, minimalism isn't for everyone. Minimalism makes ME anxious, fretful, and out of sorts. (Advocating for minimalism also smacks of privilege: some may be forced into a minimal lifestyle, but the choice to live with minimal possessions is, I believe, always a choice made out of privilege.) Hooray for those who are made happy by it, but be careful about telling anyone else they ""should"" be living that way. Enjoy your lifestyle, by all means, but resist the urge look down smugly on those who choose other paths. This isn't life or death, folks. It's just stuff, and I like more stuff than you do. I own fifteen cardigans and 42 dessert plates; they make me happy and I have room to store them neatly, so who cares?I am not a minimal kind of person. I live alone in a 1,400 sq foot 3-bedroom house, and it's just the right amount of space. I will never be a tiny-house person or a throw-anything-you-haven't-used-in-six-months-away person.The author's attitude towards papers of all sorts is ""just throw it away,"" although she grudgingly admits the necessity of keeping contracts and deeds. She thinks filing is unnecessary: just throw like items in a box. (Since you're barely keeping any paperwork, who cares?) She thinks words/text clutter a house. I surround myself with words. I've considered papering my walls in newsprint. I like layers, textures, overlapping objects. See? Not a minimalist. ... and that's okay. Because there's a lot in this book that DOES work and DOES apply to anyone:- seriously, the clothes-folding method is genius. - I've long held that you shouldn't keep anything that ""you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful,"" which is similar to her directions to only keep that which makes you feel joy when you see/touch it. Sorry, you still need to keep that bottle of advil even if it doesn't ""spark joy"" when you hold it; but the ugly-sweater gift someone gave you that you've been hesitating about throwing out?

Good god.... if its not for you, then one star it and let it be. Hahahaa!I picked this up because I have been so stressed out over a messy household, and I figured I'll give just about anything a shot at this point. I have been in my new-to-me house for almost 2 years and I still have cardboard boxes full of stuff in every room.... so yes. It's a problem. The fact that I NEED to do something to change my current living situation is what drove me to pick up this book, and for someone who is only curious about it and doesn't feel like their house/home lifestyle needs changing probably won't get much out of this. (see random assortment of reviews)Someone referred to this author as bat-shit-crazy with her woowoo methods- hahaha... and maybe some of the things she talks about is a stretch... I'm unsure about needing to greet my house every time I walk in the door or to clean out my purse and thank it daily for working hard for me... but you know what? I'm gonna give it a try- because it might make me more conscious of my things.I totally believe the testimony's of people who have gone through the whole KonMarie process, and their lives changing across the board. That is what prompted me to pick up this book. I have been living with things that stress me out and take up valuable space- when I get through all my items and can purge what doesn't ""spark joy"" I'll be able to have space and room to do the things that I really enjoy. ""After all, our possessions very accurately relate the history of the decisions we have made in life. Tidying is a way of taking stock that shows us what we really like""""It is a very strange phenomenon, but when we reduce what we own and essentially 'detox' our house, it has a detox effect on our bodies as well.""Anyway- excited to start this process.Anyone interested in changing their home and the constant struggle with finding storage and space for their things could benefit from this book."

Звучи абсурно нали? Не точно. Като гледам какво огромно количество излишни боклуци хората пазят в къщите си само защото не им стиска да ги изхвърлят, въпреки, че събират прах с години, има голяма нужда от такава книга. Един от бичовете на съвременния начин на живот е именно трупането на предмети и дрехи, които всъщност не ползваме, но някак ни е съвестно да хвърлим или мислим, че ""може да потрябват"". Постепенно домовете ни се превръшат в складове за стари боклуци, на които не можем да намерим място. Авторката е японка, която е посветила живота си на изкуството на подреждането и професионално се занимава с даване на уроци по подреждане (което е особено важно за малките японски жилища). Мари Кондо безспорно попада някъде в лекия спектър на аутизма и/или обсесивно-компулсивните разстройства, но както се казва, не е важно дали котката е черна или бяла, а дали лови мишки. И когато става дума за подреждане и чистене, трудно ще намерите някой по-добър от тоя тип хора.КонМари системата, която тя е измислила и представя в първата си книга наистина отваря очите и може да ви помогне да сложите дома си в ред и да ви мотивира да се отървете от много излишни вещи, които го задръстват, въпреки склонността на мацката да гушка сгънатите си пуловери и да обяснява удоволствието, което я пронизвало докато си подрежда чорапите.Отделно, трябва да се отбележи, че настояването на Мари Кондо да говорим на дома и дрехите си, да им благодарим и т.н. не са откачени измислици, а проста форма на самомотивация и дори когнитивна поведенческа терапия. Когато преди да изнесете презентация гледате огледалото и се надъхвате със ""Знам, че можеш!"", всъщност не говорите на огледалото, а на себе си, нали? Същото е и с вещите - много хора са толкова емоционално привързани към вещите си, че имат нужда от такова надъхване, за да се разделят с тях."

And the worst part is that I was raised by a cleaning obsessed mother, who makes Monica Geller's cleaning OCD look like child’s play.So far I have accepted that no matter how much I try, my house will never be sparkling clean for longer than ten minutes. And that I’ll never develop that amazing mom-magic that lets them know exactly where EVERYTHING is at all times. But of course, the fact that I'm terrible at it means that I'm always looking for ways to improve, which means pinning every single cleaning hack in Pinterest, where of course I saw this: The decluttering bible!The cleaning masterpiece!Everywhere I turn I'm always reading about the KonMari method, which is why I decided to break my fiction-only rule and read it. I was expecting some practical tips on keeping the house clutter free. I was NOT expecting a mixture of infomercial: “x and y read this book and have been clutter free since then!” with some self-help thrown in:”x and y were sad because their house wasn’t clean, cleaning will reboot your attitude, and reconfigure your life, all your problems will go away!”and with a dose of… well, plain weird. (Talking with your stuff? No thanks.)Let’s be honest, not everything was bad, but it wasn’t life changing. The only thing that resonated with me was the chapter on books. One of the points that Marie Kondo makes is that the purpose of a book is to be read. Once you've read it, their purpose is fulfilled and you can get rid of them. Keep the ones you love, she says, and get rid of the rest. I have to admit that as a book lover I tend to keep LOTS of books, some I didn’t even like! And even more when they are digital. So I’m taking her advice and getting rid of them. Starting with this one."

So 5 stars it is! I've struggled all my life with trying to decide what to keep and what to throw away. I've known that my possessions weigh my down and stress me out. This book addressed all the reasons I keep things, and then, gave me the tools to let them go. As I read this book, I kept thinking two things. First, the author has some type of mental illness--probably OCD. Second, that through her obsession with tidiness, she has uncovered some truths that elude almost all of us. Usually mental illness doesn't lead to such positive results, including a hugely successful business and bestselling books!I have been learning about ""Mindfulness""and doing mindful meditations for about a year. This book encourages a very mindful way of living. We know what we have, we want what we have, we are grateful for it, and we store it neatly. I haven't been able to attack my house the way I want to for reasons beyond my control. But every tidying project I've taken on since reading this book has been a huge success. I've never known what to do with the linen closet or under the kitchen sink. After reading the book, I attacked both problem areas--removed everything, got rid of all the things I don't use, and put the remaining items back in an organized way. My family members were impressed to stunned.Her methods for folding clothes have truly been life changing for me. I've always wanted to store my clothes so that I could see everything but had no idea how to do it. Now, I can see everything in my drawers and they all look so neat and organized.

264,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1496564-robin,Rating 4 out of 5,"In 1994 I read ""Simplify Your Life"" by Elaine St. James and it inspired me to work on clearing out extraneous clutter in my house. And it worked. For a while. While my books are fairly under control (I can thank e-readers for that), my closet and paper files are out of control, and with retirement looming, closets and files need to be purged.In a timely move, the publisher sent me a complimentary copy and I do believe it might help me with what needs to be done in my house. The author's concept of only keeping things that ""spark joy"" makes sense to a point, and while Kondo recognizes that not everything we need to keep will make us happy (warranty information, insurance policies, et al), her basic policy ""to discard all papers"" seems a little extreme--and scary. She also incorporates a little bit of spiritual comic relief like thanking the belongings you use every day for doing their job--oh wait, she's serious! One fairly extreme daily ritual she follows is after returning home from work, she completely empties her purse and thanks each item--wallet and such--for doing a good job, then putting the empty purse away and repacking it all the next morning. If I tried that it would last for about one day. Update: I wrote the above over a month ago and have since tamed the papers in my house but not the closet, and will continue in my efforts to reduce belongings and extraneous household items and clothes.Second Update (June 2015) - I have purged--somewhat--my closets, and while not yet completely organized, are way better than they were.

On the other hand, she seems to want to put all the clothes in drawers so that she can use closets for other things. She tells the reader repeatedly that she's been tidying since she was 5. As well as her profession, it is also her favorite hobby, which has to frighten anyone a little.

Hay partes con las que no he conectado, toda la parte espiritual del asunto, la energía de los ""objetos dormidos"" y que la casa te vaya a tratar mejor porque le hayas saludado al entrar suena a pensamiento mágico muy fuertemente. Y he leído esto de la espiritualidad en otras reseñas de Goodreads muy criticosas y muy ""aaay todo mal, este libro no te explica qué hacer con los medicamentos de la quimioterapia, ¿eh, Marie Kondo, dónde ordenas tú esos? Falsaria, buuu, todo mal, supermal"". No leáis las reseñas de libros famosos en Goodreads. No las leáis.Pero oye, esto va de pensamiento mágico. ¿Qué valor real tiene una postal sin escribir que te dieron en 1997 en Disneyland París? ¿Qué excusa puedo tener para guardar mis patines rotos desde 2011? ¿Que lo pasé muy bien con ellos? ¿Qué problema hay realmente en mirar con cariño un libro, o sentir que le das las gracias por haber cumplido su cometido al deshacerte de él? Si me invento una excusa emocional a para guardar mis movidas viejas, al fin y al cabo es una racionalización, así que puedo usar el libro y también racionalizar lo de que las cosas que me sobran ""no me hacen sentir emoción en la patata"" y tirar todas las mierdas que he acumulado en 30 años.

It definitely gave me the motivation to start and make a game plan of how I'm going to tackle all the ""stuff."" Picking up each item one by one and asking myself if it sparks joy. What it really comes down to is if you continually need to clean your home - that just means that you have too much stuff and you don't have a proper home for your things. Your home will never be clean and organized if you keep endless amounts of stuff. And all the stuff makes you loose focus of what you truly love and want to keep. The treasure get hidden amongst random stuff. Once you clean your home you are able to focus on the more important things in life, like your health and well being. I'm surprised this book didn't touch on ""minimalism"" because it almost did but didn't coin the term. It says to get rid of all the things you don't truly love and find practical but it didn't talk specifically about ""minimalizing"" your home."

I took away some great tips and now really had a desire to throw almost everything away. I think I just need permission on a few things I had questions about, and her philosophy on what to keep makes sense. Here manta is throw it out if it doesn't spark joy. I've thought about this a bunch in the week or so since I finished this. The places I get stumped are things that I absolutely need like my potato peeler. I use it at least once a week and sometimes more, but I certainly don't look at it and think, ""this sparks joy.""

281,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/109882116-andr-e,Rating 2 out of 5,"No... I will not speak to my socks. I'm giving it 2 stars because I managed to finish listening to the audiobook and because there are a few things mentioned that I agree with but overall, this book has left me flabbergasted... and not in a good way. It reads as someone who essentially personified things because of her extremely lonely childhood; it reads as someone who went to great lengths to people-please for approval; it reads as tidying as a trauma response. I was very surprised as the Konmari clean-up method was very popular a few years back and she even had a Netflix special! I sincerely hope the author got some help tidying her deep-seeded anguish and found people that brings her joy. Her method consists of decluttering fully by category in this specific order: clothes, books, papers, misc. and mementos. Only once you've decluttered fully (and as quickly as possible) can you go on to the tidying process and finding a place for everything.Here are the things I do agree with:- We own too many things. I agree that it is important to downsize and to keep things that ""bring you joy"" so that you can truly appreciate and be grateful of what you have in your environment.- We shouldn't feel guilty for discarding items that we no longer want or need no matter who gave it to us. The author recommends to discard items when family members are not around so as to not feel pressured to keep them. Good tip!- She recommends storing purses inside bigger purses. That is also a good tip!Here is what I do NOT agree with:- ""Everyone can declutter their house in one go"". No, just no. Talk to any parent, animal owner, hoarder or disabled person and they will tell you they cannot do the intensive decluttering process in one go. For example, when decluttering clothes, you must take out ALL of your clothes/shoes/accessories from EVERYWHERE in the house and put it in a pile on the floor. Then, take every piece of clothing one by one to see if it brings you joy. If not, you thank it out loud and discard. Only once you've completed the entire decluttering process can you put the clothes back in its place... and only if you fold it in a very specific way. If you find more clothes after this process the author says to automatically throw it away. As a Canadian mom (so clothes for -40 to +40 Celsius weather), pet owner and a person living with disabilities I cannot fathom making a MOUND of clothes on the floor and getting through this task in one go. Physically impossible! She also believes that all our clothes for all seasons should fit within our closets. Don't know many Canadians who can achieve this!- She believes women should try wearing something elegant to bed or when lounging at home because if you wear sweatpants, you'll start looking like someone who belongs in sweatpants and that's not attractive. *twitch* NO! I understand that you should take care of your appearance in a sense that you should have good hygiene and clean clothes... but this ""everything must be perfect"" attitude is not good for your mental health. The fact that only women must do this is also a red flag and indicative of her own internal struggles with appearance.- She says that TBR books should be automatically discarded as you will never read them. (I'm reading my book!?) She also says to only own 30 books and to store them in the closet. I love seeing my books so my pretty bookcases will remain on display thank you!- Papers: throw it all away except the ones you have to keep (insurance, will etc.) but just throw them in a box. Don't bother filing them. *twitch* I don't understand how she can be so particular about folding her socks a certain way so the get the vacation they deserve (I assume it's so that the elastics don't stretch but she insists on personifying clothes) and yet she ""hates filing"" so she recommends not doing it. Isn't filing part of tidying? Won't you waste time fishing through a box of paper when you need them? Again, it's the dichotomy of the whole thing that irks me.- Misc: she recommends not storing guest bedding, to just buy new ones when guests come over. Don't save spare buttons: if your blouse has a loose button just buy a new one. I find this very wasteful and not everyone may have the luxury of just buying new when they want.- Mementos: boxes of photos you haven't sorted yet? Grandpa's box of old pictures? That box of pictures from a big trip you went on a few years ago? She says to throw it away as you'll never sort them plus every trip only has a maximum of 5 good pictures! *twitch twitch twitch*. You can't simply buy another memory of a trip at the store! Again, makes me believe that she hasn't been able to connect with other human beings and known the joys of going through old pictures and memories.- She states that using her method will make you feel so good that you will lose weight and the decluttering of your home can trigger a detox of your body so you might have diarrhea and acne breakouts. In my opinion that ""detox"" might come from the fact that you'll be in contact with a lot of paper, dust, other allergens while decluttering every nook and cranny... I don't think ""looking better"" should be advertised as a result of her Konmari method.I have many more negative things to say but I think you get the gist and I will stop here. This novel had a lot of words for nothing. All the examples of her childhood memories of tidying (as a trauma response) are very sad. No 5-year-old should be obsessed with storage solutions. The physical joy she gets from organizing is, again, very sad. I feel like that is the only joy she ever knew. The fact that she admits coming home so tired after a long day's work that she falls asleep on the floor without taking her clothes off is worrisome. The fact that she keeps repeating that she has a 100% success rate with all her clients is impossible.I do not recommend this book. I did not bring me joy... only worry and pity for the author."

Végül igen ellentmondásos véleményem alakult ki a művéről. Mivel stílusa nem csak engem bosszantott, a hasznos részeket mindenki okulására itt kivonatolom. (Szívesen.)Marie Kondo alapelvei tömören a következőkben foglalhatók össze.Egyszerre, szünet nélkül kell rendet rakni. Elsőként selejtezünk, második fázisban a megmaradó tárgyakat rendezzük.A tárgyainkat nem helységenként selejtezzük, mert szétszóródtak az idő folyamán az egész házban. Kategóriánként selejtezünk.1. Ruhák: ami nem tetszik, attól megszabadulunk. Nem tartjuk meg a közvetlen környezetünkben, nem adjuk rokonnak.2.Könyvek: Kondo véleménye szerint csak azokat a könyveket tartsuk meg, ami örömet okoz, ha kézbe vesszük. *Szerintem mindet tartsuk meg, aminek hasznát látjuk, mert egy könyvtárat globálisan kezelünk, nem úgy, hogy a borítója megy- e a gurulós székem kárpitozásához… Később finomítja véleményét: azért szabaduljunk meg minden, nem szeretetet kiváltó könyvtől, mert ha olvastuk, már úgyis beteljesítette feladatát.3. Iratok: minden irattól, ami nem azonnal, korlátozott ideig, vagy örök időkre szükséges, meg kell szabadulni. Szerinte minden iskolai jegyzetet ki kell dobni, hiszen ha jók voltak, úgyis megjegyeztük a tartalmukat.4. Egyéb holmik, azaz komono- kacatok: minden reklámtárgy, hiányos készlet, kallódó alkatrész kidobandó. 5. Érzelmi töltettel bíró tárgyak: nem dobjuk ki akkor sem, ha pl. reklámtárgy. Az ilyen tárgyak, ha értéktelenek is, boldoggá teszik a mindennapjainkat.A megmaradó tárgyaknak kell, hogy legyen kijelölt, állandó helye. Az előbb felsorolt hasznos tartalmat leszámítva számos stílusbeli negatívumot látok Kondo művében. Visszatetszést keltett bennem, hogy alapvetően mindent, ami nem okoz „örömet”, ki akart dobni. (Eleve, nagyon homályosan határozta meg, mi jelenti számára az örömet.) Ugyanakkor úgy beszélt a tárgyakhoz, mintha lelkük és érzéseik lennének. (Ezt a feltételezésemet visszaigazolja a 2014-es kiadás 214-215. oldalán található része, ahol sintó hagyományok közvetlen hatását is említette.) Így egyesül egy önellentmondásban Kondo japán animizmusa és a fogyasztói társadalom mindent elhajító pazarlása. Mindezek ellenére radikális rendrakó módszere könnyen követhető, logikus felépítésű. Rumlis embereknek mindenképpen ajánlott olvasmány."

Her act of tidying doesn’t apply to her storytelling. Her book was at least two hours too long. 4. That being said, I believe she does have some great advice on getting things in order.UPDATE:I watched Marie’s series on Netflix. Her book does not show her personality, her kindness, and her gentle nature like the series does. I think maybe her narrator for the audiobook did not do her justice."

285,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/946086-sterlingcindysu,Rating 3 out of 5,"When I read a nonfiction book like this it's hard to rate it, because I'm judging the content as well as the writing. *edit* One good hint she says is not to put your seasonal clothes away. I live in Virginia, so putting away my ""summer"" clothes is only for about 10 weeks anyway. Kondo's theory of ""tidying up"" isn't the ""red up"" they do in Pennsylvania. By tidying-up (which you only need to do once) Kondo wants people to toss out their clutter. Her clients throw out bags and bags of belongings. And sure enough, there's room for everything! and it's easy to clean! and your skin clears up! (not kidding) and you lose weight! (again, not kidding). I've moved partially or wholly each summer for the past three years and her ""tidying-up"" sounds an awful lot like unloading a house to move into an apartment. You make hard decisions. It's when Thoreau wrote in Walden, about living deliberately. Perhaps because she's younger, she spends a lot of pages describing how to tidy and store clothes, but nothing on other areas such as kitchen cupboards, linen closets, attics, garages, etc. She also shows her age when she tells people not to unload their stuff in their parents' house. One rule she has is to unload stuff and not show anyone, just toss it. Why? If someone can use it, why not? Especially if it has family history or is a good appliance or just donate it, why not? Kondo also doesn't want anyone to buy items to stock up, such as underwear. ""When you buy something, take off the tags and put it out,"" she urges. Well, when I find bras, panties, etc on sale, I'm going to stock up. She told a woman with 82 pair of stockings to toss them. Why not just stop buying them and use up the stock, instead of tossing them and then buying them again over time? (That's one reason why I wished she would have discussed kitchen cupboards, to see if she had the same philosophy there.) If I buy clothing out of season or I need to see if they match something else, I leave the tags on so I can return it. There's a reason why people do these things. She really needed photos or pictures showing how to fold clothes and put them into drawers. I'm surprised that her Japanese clients seem to have as much clutter as Americans. Anyway, when she urges people to have nothing in their showers, and take shampoo, conditioner, and soap in with you--and then DRY your soap afterwards and put it away--that crossed the line for me. How do you dry a bar of soap?? Update 2-26-2016. I get a daily poem-of-the-day email and look at this one! Sinking into the Leopard PillowI threw out everything that didn't give me a spark and hung all the whites on the table. Greens and deep dirt browns and grays. The sensory titillations of the day entered each limb's phantom collapse and gait, tremor are you there? See until you are gone and there is only what you are seeing. Just trying that meant yesterday. What to do today. Falls the shadow.

Бестселлер японської експертки з прибирання Марі Кондо обіцяє дивовижні зміни: якщо дотримуватися запропонованого методу, ви зможете навести лад і підтримувати його практично без зусиль. А для цього вам треба позбутися всього зайвого. Тобто викинути мотлох.До мотлоху авторка відносить не лише старі й поламані речі. І не лише ті, якими ви рідко користуєтеся або не користуєтеся взагалі. Головний критерій — чи приносить вам ця річ радість. Ні? Тоді негайно у смітник! «Після нашого заняття моя клієнтка викинула 42 (38, 50… і т.д.) сміттєвих пакетів непотребу», — гордо заявляє Марі Кондо.Моя українська душа одразу починає протестувати. По-перше, це ж так неощадливо! Замість викидати, нові речі, якими ти не користуєшся, можна продати. Або подарувати чи віддати на благодійність. По-друге, це геть неекологічно. Ви тільки уявіть, як усі ці її клієнти десятками пакетів засмічуюють планету! Звісно, високотехнологічна Японія давно придумала, як утилізувати і перобляти сміття. Але начитаються книжки українці — скажімо, львів’яни. Понесуть свій непотріб на сміття. І що тоді? Бідні Грибовичі!А якщо серйозно, то ідея насправді хороша — очистити простір від всього зайвого (тоді й свідомість очищується, запевняє авторка, і я їй вірю). Просто не сприймати «викидання» аж так буквально. Хоча, разом з тим, Марі Кондо застерігає від пасток, які ми самі собі створюємо — приміром, замість викинути речі, відправляємо їх на зберігання до батьків. Свій дім-то ми очистимо, а от батьківський… Ну і, зберігаючи старі речі, ми ніяк не можемо відпустити минуле — а відтак, воно часто тягне нас назад.Прибирання Марі Кондо пропонує робити за категоріями — починати з одягу і закінчувати речами, які мають сентиментальну цінність. Це дуже ��озумний підхід, інакше вийде, як у анекдоті: викидаюи мотлох, головне не почати розглядати його:) Цікаву пораду вона дає щодо фотографій: цінуйте себе такими, якими ви є зараз, і не зациклюйтеся на старих образах.Загалом, книжка досить цікава і корисна, але я не зафанатіла від неї:) Втім, отакі поради виділила для себе і планую спробувати або вже спробувала:— на вішаках речі розвішувати від теплішого до легшого, від темнішого до світлішого.— складати речі не горизонтально, а вертикально (я думала, що це працює тільки для комодів, але спробувала в шафі — і, о диво! — все нормально тримається купи, лишається багато місця і, відчинивши шафу, одразу бачиш, кожну одежину, яка на полиці лежить);— прийшовши додому, одразу розбирати сумку, викладати з неї всі-всі речі на відведені для них місця. Хочу спробувати привчити себе до цього)— наводячи лад з книжками, відпускати (в мене рука не повертається написати «викидати»:) ті, які тримаєш з думкою «може, мені колись захочеться її перечитати», але жодного разу не перечитав. Ну або ті, які збирався-збирався, і так і не почав читати.Певно, найбільше моє світоглядне відкриття стосувалося самої авторки. Мене вразило те, що вже з 5 років вона захоплювалася журналами для домогосподарок, вишуковувала і випробовувала різні методи прибирання, зберігання і підтр��мання порядку. Ми якось звикли, що «домоведення» — то така річ, яку повинна знати геть кожна жінка, і для мене досить дивно було усвідомити, що це може бути і хобі, і науковим інтересом, і «справжньою» професією."

Não deveriam, pois fazem muito sentido.Veja bem, se você se propõe a ler esse livro, é porque, provavelmente, quer aprender um método de organizar melhor suas coisas. E isso acontece porque seu método não funciona, certo? O que autora simplesmente propõe, então, é que você comece a pensar na organização com outros olhos. Que não seja apenas uma simples maneira de organizar a tralha que você guarda. Para isso, algumas atitudes são postas de maneira simbólica para que sua filosofia em relação aos seus objetos mude. Sem alterar sua forma de pensar, dificilmente você conseguirá encontrar uma forma prática e funcional de organização. Resumidamente, Marie Kondo defende que você viva com o suficiente e se desapague do excesso. Para isso, é preciso descobrir quais itens te trazem mais alegria, quais itens dão sentido a sua vida. Não seria incrível ter uma estante com apenas os livros que mudaram a sua vida? Ou um guarda-roupa apenas com vestimentas que te deixem confortável e se sentindo bem? É essa a técnica esmiuçada no livro, com exemplos e dicas práticas. Eu acho que a experiência de leitura pode ser ainda melhor com ajuda do livro ""Me poupe!"", da Nathalia Arcuri. Assim, você alinha a organização e aquilo que é útil à educação financeira, fazendo com que você se conheça melhor, entenda seus objetivos e qual o melhor caminho para chegar lá usando aquilo que você já tem.Obviamente, eu não concordo com tudo que a Marie Kondo diz e sinto que muitas coisas devem ser adaptadas ao meu estilo de vida, mas não acho que ela fale absurdos como trechos soltos do livro podem dar a entender. Por exemplo, em um dado momento, ela recomenda que as mulheres durmam com vestimentas elegantes, e não moletons. É um trecho curto, algumas frases e ela logo sai desse assunto. Não entendo que ela quis ""cagar regra"", afinal, a mensagem aqui não era ditar o que se deve ou não usar, mas sim usar aquilo que nos deixa mais confiantes. Ela argumenta que a maneira como nos vestimos influencia muito na nossa autoimagem, então discorda do conceito de ""roupas de usar em casa"" (aquelas velhas ou que gostamos menos), porque devemos usar em casa também aquilo que eleva nossa autoestima. Afinal, a casa é onde criamos raízes. Gostei muito de fazer a leitura e já estou colocando o que aprendi em prática. Até o momento, separei 15 peças do guarda-roupa para doar, selecionei jogos e livros também para doação e joguei fora duas sacolas enormes com papéis e caixas que eu nunca usaria. Recomendo."

This was one book that had many suggestions that I found ridiculous, and some that were actually helpful. I don't think it was worth the $16.99 I paid for it, but I won't devalue the helpful parts because of the unhelpful parts. There are some things Kondo does not at all discuss: (1) How to maintain a tidy house with young children, who are never apt to put things back in their ""designated space"" or clean up after themselves without a fuss. Certainly, Kondo can't help with discipline and parenting, but almost all of this book is unhelpful for these parents.(2) How to discard items that are functional, or rather, how to determine the functional items that you need and don't need. A large part of this book is about disposing clothes that aren't worn often, but what about my stock of toiletries and cleaning supplies? The only point she discusses this in the book is telling the reader about her hoarder horror stories (which were mild compared to what TLC sells). (3) This is probably the worst: How to clean grime, dirt, and surfaces more easily or less frequently. She only speaks about items. But what about floors, kitchen counters, tabletops, bathroom sinks and floors, bathtubs, etc.? That is where most of the cleaning time gets spent. There is (only) one concept that Kondo explains that is helpful: (1) How to store items inside closets or spaces, or how to store items in a more compact way. I found her tidbit about how to fold laundry into drawers helpful. And she suggests having a designated spot for every item that you have, which is also helpful. A big part of her book, though, is about discarding things that you don't need. I would agree with this suggestion; there is a lot of clutter in my house like books and accessories that my family and I never touch. I think people at first might underestimate how much they need to throw or give away. But the biggest problem with this book is that Kondo constantly instructs the reader and her clients to throw away things that they don't need periodically. But she never mentions anything about not buying things that you don't need in the first place. TL;DR: Don't buy this book. Just borrow it from the library. "

I willingly piled all of my crap onto my bed and then audibly thanked cardigans and asymmetrical hemlines for their service, as I stuffed them into bin bags. I even went so far as to tell people that Marie Kondo was right about the fact that ‘storage is a booby trap’.But about a third of the way through The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, Kondo went off the rails. Really, seriously bloody berserk. And my willingness to play along ground to a halt. Why? Because of her abominable attitude toward books*. And I quote:“Books are essentially paper – sheets of paper printed with letters and bound together. Their true purpose is to be read, to convey the information to their readers. It’s the information they contain that has meaning. There is no meaning in them just being on your shelves.” WRONG.“Unread books – ‘sometime’ means ‘never’.You may have wanted to read it when you bought it, but if you haven’t read it by now, the book’s purpose was to teach you that you didn’t need it.”WHAT THE ACTUAL?“I finally decided to rip the relevant page out of the book.” YES, THIS WAS THE BIT WHERE SHE WAS TRANSCRIBING PASSAGES FROM BOOKS SHE LIKED AND THEN GETTING RID OF THE BOOKS.

290,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/611960-jenn,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book was clearly written for the Japanese market, so if you keep this in mind - along with the fact that the author was a Shinto shrine maiden for five years - it makes sense. Much mockery has been made in other reviews of her advice that one should both speak to and listen to one's possessions. I don't really find this to be that odd. Japanese tradition is full of objects imbued with spirits, but Western society has parallels: the Velveteen Rabbit, Pinocchio or even Antiques Roadshow discussions of family heirlooms and the value of patina. There is a great deal of common sense in her method. Some of us jettison possessions only when we move from one home to another, and this method has that same feel. Her basic premise is: gather up all like items at once so you can take a full inventory and then pare down the collection to only the items you actually like. Ditch anything that doesn't make the cut, and then figure out how to store the things you have kept. Theoretically, since you've only kept the things you truly like seeing and owning, you should have no trouble making space for those things in your home. The other bit of sage advice: keep those like items all in the same place.As someone with a lot of stuff and many weird collections of obscure things, I am both excited and apprehensive about trying this out. I am fairly certain that it will take me at least her average timespan of six months to complete, possibly more due to the aforementioned collections of weird stuff. But I can safely say that I could easily gather all of my elastic hair ties into a shockingly large pile, pare them down to the ones I actually like and happily dispose of the rest. I would love to finally gather all of my jewelry making supplies into one place so that I don't have to waste time searching for that perfect bead I know I have somewhere. It sounds like a great thing to accomplish that will reduce future stress when trying to accomplish things that I actually want to do, which is her entire point."

Thank God Marie Kondo doesn't run a cult, because I would gladly empty my bank accounts and ride a shipshape battleship just for the chance to reach tidy enlightenment.This proved to me that I am not two things that I thought for certain I was:1. A minimalist2. An aggressive weederSince I started reading, I have disposed of three bags of clothes, two big bags of trash, a shelving unit, various knapsacks and coolers, a box fan, half of my dvds and GASP, even three boxes of books. Those who know me know how significant that last part is. I'm feeling lighter and freer, but to be honest, I haven't even been as aggressive as Marie Kondo suggests, and I don't think I'm close to being done.I'm taking off a star for the faux modesty Kondo displays throughout the book, but otherwise this is a great guide to cleaning your house or apartment. It doesn't suggest complex storing methods or tell you exactly how many items you should have, nor does it tell you to get rid of everything you own and start over. It simply tells you to surround yourself with the things that make you happy. You would think that would be obvious, but obviously I haven't been doing that. If you can cut through the new-agey, almost religious aspects of this book to get to the meat of the advice, I think there's a lot to be gained here.Even better: Listen to the audiobook, which dances around the more boastful portions of Kondo's writing, and you will be free to take notes.

Suddenly my desk would be clear of clutter. My drawers would be easy to close. My socks would be happy and cutely arranged. But I found myself reading this with a sense of dread. A real lump in my throat, like I just might be sick at some point and I wanted to be ready with a counter strategy. Do this all at once she said.Don't just work at it a little at a time. Let's get this done and over with.Hold everything in your hand to see if it gives you a spark of joy. If not. Into a black plastic garbage bag, landfill be damned. Skip over the donation. Evidently if it doesn't give you a spark of joy, it's not going to give anyone else one either.So I read it with that sense of dread and that lump and then I started worrying about the emotional health of the author. She seemed so wrapped up in her things, while at the same time trying to throw them away. She wants us to untwine our socks and unpack our purse each night all while wearing some Manga themed t-shirt, or our equivalent of a manga-themed t-shirt even at the risk of being laughed at or ridiculed. She told me to throw away my photographs for god sake! And unread books. It felt like preparing for death more than creating joy. I think I like the one drawer at a time and when you get around to it approach.I'm still cluttered, and I've lost the book. But I've still got my shelf of ""to read"" books and a few shoe boxes full of photos."

But at the same time, I'm glad I listened to it because I got a quick, big-picture vision of tidying up (I listen to audio books at 3x the speed so this took a little over an hour) and it helped me appreciate the concepts better to hear them all at once.Second thought: I went into this book mostly to better appreciate my sister's minimalist lifestyle, and frankly, doubted it would apply to me. Turns out, most of it did. Maybe all of it. (Except the part about thanking the house, but hey, I won't dig it till I try it.) She called out a LOT of my habits - like getting rid of clothes by forcing them on my younger sisters, saving boxes from appliances because maybe, someday I'll repack them, and keeping something because I got it as a gift once and have not used since. In fact, time and again her points hit so specifically home that I would experience a twinge of shock. Oh yeah...I do that...Third thought: I'm not sure how to rate this. It is not like I have put her words into action because I literally just finished listening and I'm in the middle of finals prep so I'm not going to tear my house apart. But I am moving soon and this seems like a great place to start with packing...Anyway, 4 stars for applicability and general enjoyment with the caveat that I haven't actually done anything. "

And then again “why.” The whole point in both discarding and keeping things is to be happy.Then you begin sorting. Start with clothes. Do one group at a time. For example, start with tops (shirts, sweaters, etc). Gather all tops from all closets, drawers, boxes, etc. Put them in one big pile on the floor. Then pick up each one and ask yourself does it “bring you joy.” Put in discard pile if no. Subsequent groups in order: bottoms, clothes on hangers (coats, suits, etc), socks, underwear, handbags, accessories,...After clothing do the following groups in order: books, papers, miscellaneous. Do photos and mementos last.I like some of her storing ideas. Instead of laying t-shirts flat in drawers, she suggests folding and stacking in a way that uses fewer drawers.The author talks to her home and to her possessions.

Actually, one of my mottos in life is “tidy home tidy mind”. I really agree with this and try to follow by it on a daily basis. This book is somewhat ridiculous at times; very repetitive (how many times the expression ‘spark joy’ popped up?) and so unintentionally hilarious you have to give it points for it.The author, I believe is rather silly and definitely OCD to the extreme. She talks to her house, to her things and her furniture; thinks socks have feelings, empties out her purse every single day and so many other odd things. She also loves to throw things away, don’t get me wrong, I also enjoy cleaning my house and disposing of unnecessary things, but she takes it to next level.Overall, interesting read as this might give you the push to be more organized and less materialist but nothing new for someone with the minimum of common sense and organizational skills.

Over the years I have read many books, articles, and watched countless YouTube videos on minimalism and decluttering and have never come across a method quite like the KonMari method. I loved her unique, quirky, innovative, and practical approach to tidying. I appreciate that this method does not place a limit on a number of items or try to limit anyone's personal interests. Marie Kondo's voice is unique and her passion makes the words jump off the page. While I may never greet my house or say hello to my socks, I do love her approach to having our possessions suit our lives and striving to have only those possessions that support our lives and our dreams.

I read this in preparation of moving, and just plain trying to figure out how to stop buying cheap clothes and get rid of things I don't need, and instead save for and buy one well-made, expensive thing that I absolutely love. I shall start using this method. The key to discarding is this: ""Does it give you joy?"" If not, chuck it.

De-a lungul timpului am strâns extrem de multe lucruri (majoritatea în camera mea), și am căpătat un mic statut de hoarder. Am strâns pixuri, jurnale, caiete, cărți, jucării, haine, parfumuri, figurine Kinder, obiecte de decor, gentuțe, și câte și mai câte.În perioada generalei și a liceului mă trezeam extrem de des organizându-mi camera, obiectele, și de multe ori nu reușeam să găsesc un balans. Nu eram fericită de poziționarea lor sau de unele lucruri pe care le aveam. Încă mă descopeream și de aceea cred că treceam des prin toate, pentru a mai renunța la câte un lucru care simțeam că nu mă mai reprezintă.Cu toate că scăpam de lucruri, până în urmă cu ceva timp, nu am reușit să mă descotorosesc de unele lucruri pe care nu doar că nu apucam să le folosesc, dar nici nu mă mai reprezentau. Recent am tot auzit de cartea The Life-Changing magic of tidying de Marie Kondo, regăsind-o chiar și în noile episoade cu Fetele Gilmore.Curiozitatea m-a mâncat rău de tot în palmă, așa că la început de 2017 am zis să lecturez această carte de tip self help, care se presupune că m-ar ajuta cumva să îmi fac ordine în casă și în gânduri.Metoda KonMariAutoarea japoneză Marie Kondo aka KonMari a fost toată viața ei nițel obsedată de curățenie. Mereu când venea de la școală aranja diverse zone ale casei, și căuta diverse metode de aranjare sau păstrare a obiectelor familiei. Cu toate acestea, descoperea de foarte multe ori că încercările ei sunt în van, întrucât nu își găsea o ordine în viață prin ceea ce făcea.Cu timpul, ea a descoperit cele mai bune tactici care te pot ajuta să îți aranjezi casa. Metoda KonMari se referă la cum un obiect (haine, cărți, hârtii, etc.) îți poate aduce un impuls de fericire. Când simți această fericire înseamnă că obiectul pe care îl ții în mână trebuie păstrat.Prin modul în care Marie Kondo ne învață să facem curățenie, vom avea mai apoi acces cu ușurință la tot ceea ce ne înconjoară, fiindu-ne astfel mai ușor în păstrarea curățeniei. În același timp mintea ni se va elibera și ne vom simți fericiți pentru faptul că păstrăm în jur doar lucrurile care ne pun zâmbetul pe buze.Îți stârnește fericirea? Cum aplici metoda KonMariProcesul de ordine generală făcută în cadrul locuinței nu este unul simplu, mai ales dacă aveți tendința să strângeți multe lucruri, sau dacă aveți o casă mare în care nu locuiți singur. Atunci când nu locuiți singur, trebuie musai să nu vă ocupați de lucrurile familiei sau ale partenerului. Trebuie să porniți în procesul de curățenie doar cu lucrurile pe care le aveți, iar dacă cei din jur vor să participe la procesul de ordine, o pot face împreună cu voi, sau separat.Primul lucru pe care trebuie să îl știți este ordinea cu care veți începe curățenia. Pornim de la lucrurile care par cel mai simplu de aranjat, iar la final lăsăm lucrurile sentimentale, care ne pot lua foarte mult timp. Dacă am porni cu cele din urmă menționate, ne-ar pieri cheful de ordine încă din primele minute, și am fi extrem de obosiți.Ordinea categoriilor:

   Haine 
  
   Cărți 
  
   Acte, hârțoage 
  
   Komono (diverse obiecte - papetărie, electronice, machiaj, snacksuri etc.) 
  
   Obiecte sentimentale 
  
   Amintiri și suveniruri 
  
În momentul în care ne apucăm de aranjarea unei categorii, vom lua toate obiectele ce țin de acea categorie și le vom pune într-un singur loc. Spre exemplu, luăm toate hainele noastre (nu ale mamei, fratelui, iubitului, ci ale noastre) și le punem în mijlocul camerei, pe jos, sau pe pat. Vom strânge absolut toate hainele (cele de prin hol, cele agățate prin baie, cele uitate în cuier, etc. - excepție fac hainele de la spălat) și le vom pune într-un maldăr.Vom sorta acel maldăr de haine în funcție de tipul hainelor: blugi, bluze, etc. Având toate hainele la un loc, vom realiza cât de multe avem, și ne vom simți uneori chiar copleșiți de numărul mare.Modul în care vom alege ce păstrăm este foarte simplu. Vom lua obiectul în mână, îl vom simți, și ne vom pune o întrebare importantă: ""Does it spark joy?"" - ""Îmi trezește fericire?"".Dacă simțim în suflet o fericire, înseamnă că obiectul în cauză ne produce o stare de bine, și că îl vom păstra. Este foarte important să avem contact cu obiectul nostru, pentru a simți mai apoi impulsul pe care organismul îl are.Există și situații când există obiecte care ne pot da o stare de bine, însă acestea să nu ne fie utile absolut deloc (o bluză pe care nu o purtăm, dar ne aduce amintiri frumoase din copilărie). Atunci va trebui să ne întrebăm dacă acel lucru ne mai poate fi util în vreun mod sau nu. Putem păstra obiecte inutile, atâta timp cât acestea ne aduc o fericire mare. Este bine să putem diferenția păstrarea unor obiecte care ne fac acum fericiți față de cele care ne-au făcut fericiți la un moment dat.
Cum să aranjezi




 După ce terminăm de sortat o categorie, va trebui să aranjăm lucrurile în moduri cât mai utile și care ne aduc o stare de bine.Haienele ce trebuiesc agățate vor fi aranjate de la stânga spre dreapta, pornind cu cele mai groase și lungi. Ordinea generală ar fi: geci, rochii, jachete, blugi, fuste, bluze. Așezând hainele de la groase spre subțiri, și de la lungi spre scurte, se va crea ca o săgeată ce crește de la stânga spre dreapta. Vizual, acest aranjament (săgeata) ne va oferi o stare de ușurare, progres, liniște.Restul hainelor vor fi împăturite pe verticală, poziția aceasta fiind ideală atât vizual, cât și practic. Hainele vor fi aranjate mai frumos și vor fi la îndemână după ce au fost aranjate cu grijă și dragoste.Aranjarea cărților
""For books, timing is everything. The moment you first encounter a particular book is the right time to read it. To avoid missing that moment, I recommend that you keep your collection small."" (p.111)
Autoarea ne oferă detalii nu doar despre aranjarea hainelor, hârtiilor și altor obiecte, ci și despre cum să ne organizăm biblioteca. Cărțile vor fi sortate pe genuri după ce au fost strânse toate la un loc. Putem grupa cărțile astfel: YA, fantasy, dezvoltare personală, romantice, ilustrate, etc. Oricum considerați, le puteți grupa, iar mai apoi va trebui să le luați în mână, rând pe rând, să le atingeți coperta, și să realizați dacă va oferă fericirea deplină.Este foarte important să nu deschideți cărțile (eventual fugitiv) și să le citiți. Este o greșeală pe care mulți o fac, și de aceea nu reușesc să scape de cartea cu pricina. Și în plus, vor pierde și foarte mult timp, adâncindu-vă în lectură.Marie Kondo ne sfătuiește să păstrăm cărțile care ne fac cu adevărat fericiți. Cărțile necitite ar trebui date, excepție făcând cele pe care știți sigur că le veți citi în perioada următoare, sau care au o însemnătate mare pentru voi (cărți cu autograf, cărți în alte limbi, etc.). Important de remarcat este faptul că nu sunteți obligați să păstrați o carte doar pentru că ați primit-o cadou, sau pentru că ați cumpărat-o acum 1 an.Cărțile care nu au fost citite de foarte mult timp, au șanse mari să nu mai fie citite niciodată, sau nu prea curând (țineti cont de faptul că apar mereu cărți noi, așa că veți fi atrași de altele). Cărțile pe care le-ați achiziționat și nu v-au plăcut sau nu le-ați citit, ar trebui sortate musai! Probabil nu le veți citi niciodată, și vor fi o greutate care va va apăsa zilnic fără să vă dați seama. Scăpați de ele cât mai curând după ce va asigurați că nu vă trezesc vreo fericire.La final, este recomandat să aranjați cărțile pe rafturi numai pe verticală! În acest mod, veți vedea cărțile mult mai bine, veți avea acces la ele, și veți fi liniștit și fericit când vedeți acele cărți care vă transmit o stare de bine.Cărțile de care scăpați vor fi mai apoi date către biblioteci, anticariate, prieteni, rude, alți cititori, etc. Înainte să le prelungiți călătoria, trebuie să le mulțumiți pentru că v-au făcut fericit la un moment dat, că v-au făcut să înțelegeți anumite lucruri, că și-au îndeplinit datoria. :)Dacă sunteți obsedați de a vă face ordine/curățenie în viață, vă recomand cu mare drag acestă carte. Nu doar că veți scăpa de saci de obiecte inutile sau triste, dar veți avea ocazia să învățați care ar fi cele mai bune metode de aranjare a hainelor, cărților, și cum este bine să vă împăturiți și să oferiți dragoste tuturor obiectelor pe care le dețineți (chiar și șosetelor ^_^). Cu puțin noroc, veți descoperi talentele voastre pierdute, și veți deveni mai inspirați.Citate:
""«Don't aim for perfection. Star off slowly and discard just one item a day.» What lovely words to ease the hearts of those who lack confidence in ther ability to tidy or belive that they don't have enough time to complete the task properly."" (p.19)""I thought that this urge to tidy before an exam was a peculiar quirk of my own, but after meeting many others who do the same, I realised that it was a common phenomenon. Many people get the urge to clean up when under pressure, such as before an exam. But this urge doesn't occur because they want to clean their room. It occurs because they need to put «something else» in order."" (p.22-23)

324,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27110787-marlene,Rating 3 out of 5,"""The best way to choose what to keep and what to throw away is to take each item in one’s hand and ask: 'Does this spark joy?' If it does, keep it. If not, dispose of it. This is not only the simplest but also the most accurate yardstick by which to judge.""This is the hallmark of Marie Kondo's tidying philosophy, I think. Or at least, what she seems to be most well-known for.The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up (2014, Ten Speed Press) by  Marie Kondō is a self-help book for people looking for direction in the areas of decluttering and organizing. (This book was originally written in Japanese and has been translated into English and other languages.) This is a topic that speaks rather loudly to me, and I've devoured books, podcasts, and magazine articles on the topic. After reading some online reviews, I decided that Ms. Kondo's method was (mostly) not for me. However, after discovering that my husband had already purchased the Audible book for himself, I went ahead and listened to it. Rating: 3.5 stars (This was a difficult rating to make. I think she has a lot of good ideas, but I strongly feel that her method wouldn't work for someone like me, who has dozens of giant bins to go through in addition to the daily house clutter.) Narration: 4 or 5 stars -  (It's been too long since I've listened to it to pinpoint the rating.)How to choose what to keep?: I agree with Kondo's ""spark joy"" ""yardstick"" in general, but I also agree with some of her detractors in that I don't think it works completely. I remember one commenter somewhere saying that her underwear doesn't spark joy, but that she needs to keep it. I found that remark pretty funny. But I suppose one could make a case that we should all own only underwear that sparks joy. I don't think I could make a case for my tax returns or other necessary documents ever sparking joy, though. . . However, I think that ""sparking joy"" is still a pretty good yardstick, because the things that we need to keep are self-evident.What order should our things be decluttered in?: Ms. Kondo is very specific about the best order in which to declutter a home, beginning with the easiest and ending with the most difficult. ""The best sequence is this: clothes first, then books, papers, komono (miscellany), and lastly, mementos."" I think that's a pretty decent order. However, a tweak that I would make would be to put old papers dead last. Papers are my personal albatross. One individual page only takes up a small amount of space and can require a lengthy action that seems disproportionate to the amount of space that it takes up! Ugh! So it seems more important to tidy up other things first. What are the causes of clutter?: Kondo states that ""Clutter has only two possible causes: too much effort is required to put things away or it is unclear where things belong."" I really appreciated this point, because I'm not lazy at all, and yet I struggle with clutter. There are indeed always things that I don't put away because I feel too busy to take them to their homes. Which sets me up for berating myself later when things get out of control. I'd never previously considered that maybe it takes ""too much effort"" to put it away, and that perhaps another home needs to be found for those items. What is tidying?: ""Effective tidying involves only two essential actions: discarding and deciding where to store things. Of the two, discarding must come first."" Again, extremely logical. I think it can help to have a perspective in concrete terms like that. (Although, I will argue that this process is actually decluttering and tidying. It's easier said than done. Discarding is not an easy task.)What should be disposed of?: ""I recommend you dispose of anything that does not fall into one of three categories: currently in use, needed for a limited period of time, or must be kept indefinitely."" Why should we dispose of some of our things?: ""Putting things away creates the illusion that the clutter problem has been solved. But sooner or later, all the storage units are full, the room once again overflows with things, and some new and ""easy"" storage method becomes necessary, creating a negative spiral. This is why tidying must start with discarding. We need to exercise self-control and resist storing our belongings until we have finished identifying what we really want and need to keep."" This makes perfect sense. If I can declutter my book collection so that it fits into the bookcases I already have, a new bookcase is not necessary. Besides, there will come a point when I can fit no more bookcases in my home.How should we decide where to store our things?: ""A common mistake many people make is to decide where to store things on the basis of where it’s easiest to take them out. This approach is a fatal trap. Clutter is caused by a failure to return things to where they belong. Therefore, storage should reduce the effort needed to put things away, not the effort needed to get them out. When we use something, we have a clear purpose for getting it out. Unless for some reason it is incredibly hard work, we usually don’t mind the effort involved."" I find this to be a brilliant idea! I have some things that are stored in my master closet that don't really need to be in there, such as the family's swimsuits, beach towels, and luggage. I think I can find another home for those. I always have a pile of things ""to be put away"" into my closet because I feel like it's too much of a hassle to put things away in there. Religious elements:The following quotes demonstrate how ingrained Kondo's religion is in her book, particularly in the second half. ""In cases like this, I recommend that my clients make a personal altar in a corner of their house. Although I use the word ""altar,"" there is no need to worry about the direction it faces or the design. Just make a corner that is shrine-like. I recommend the top shelf in a bookcase because locating it above eye level makes it more shrine-like. One theme underlying my method of tidying is transforming the home into a sacred space, a power spot filled with pure energy. A comfortable environment, a space that feels good to be in, a place where you can relax—these are the traits that make a home a power spot. Would you rather live in a home like this or in one that resembles a storage shed? The answer, I hope, is obvious.""Ms. Kondo is a follower of the Shinto religion, which becomes more and more evident farther along into the book. I cannot accept that my things are living objects and that the method of storing them affects them in a negative way - apart from things being damaged from being improperly stored, that is. (Examples that come to mind are ripped wrapping paper rolls and squished hats.)""Clothes that have been shut up for half a year look wilted, as if they have been stifled. Instead, let in some light and air occasionally. Open the drawer and run your hands over the contents. Let them know you care and look forward to wearing them when they are next in season.""""When you stand in front of a closet that has been reorganized so that the clothes rise to the right, you will feel your heart beat faster and the cells in your body buzz with energy. This energy will also be transmitted to your clothes. Even when you close the closet door, your room will feel fresher. ""I just cannot accept this way of thinking. Objects are not alive.What I liked: *I liked several points that she made. (Several are quoted above. The one that struck me the most is that if we declutter our home at too slow of a pace, it's not going to make a dent. I didn't quote that one in this review, but it was right at the beginning of the book and helped ensure that I continue listening.) I think the benefit of reading any book about cleaning/decluttering/organizing is a mindset change, which can spark new mental growth, which can then result in concrete improvements in the home.What I didn’t like: *Pronouncements that certain behaviors are ""dangerous"" or ""fatal"" annoyed me as I was listening. I feel that either the author is being overly dramatic or that she thinks I'm stupid! I am aware that it could possibly be a translation issue and that this is unlikely the message Ms. Kondo is trying to send.*She claims that her students never rebound because they like a perfectly ordered space so much. She may have never HEARD of any of her followers regressing, but I'm sure it has happened. *Ms. Kondo's method is too aggressive and unrealistic for me. To be able to devote hours to go through stuff isn't anything that I can viably do, mentally or logistically.Audiobook:  Emily Woo Zeller as the narrator does a good job with this book. Movie adaptation(s): No movie, but there was a Netflix series in 2019 called Tidying up with Marie Kondo that inspired a lot of donations to thrift shops. ***********Other Recommendation(s): The four ladies below all have different spins on the whole decluttering/organizing/tidying/cleaning ball of wax. Each has written at least one book, and each has podcasts and/or videos that are available for consumption. I highly recommend dipping your toes into the podcasts to see which lady's style and focus seem to fit you best. Marla Cilley aka The FlyLady, from FlyLady.net Dana from A Slob Comes CleanCass from the Clutterbug PhilosophyLisa from Organize 365*******************************The bottom line: Kondo's book is worth reading, I think. I do not plan to read anything further by this author, nor do I plan to watch the Netflix series at any point. I can recommend her method for people who have the flexibility to devote to decluttering for hours at a time or for people who do not have years of accumulation to deal with. I'd love to hear what other people think of Kondo's methodology."

There is a continual emphasis to discard/dispose of/get rid of/garbage/rubbish. By contrast, I counted only six mentions (in passing) of ""donate"" and three mentions of ""recycle"". She never even mentioned selling used items. One person I know insisted this was an error in translation, but I disagree. If donation were important to the author, she would have dedicated at least a chapter to it. A paragraph. Something. To ask people to dispose of usable items is wasteful to the point of vulgar, in my opinion. I assume the author would insist Oh my gosh what a chore to finish!

To ask people to dispose of usable items is wasteful to the point to vulgar, in my opinion. I assume the author would insist people might have second thoughts or rebound if stuff was still in the vicinity. But what about a used item giving joy to a new owner? She should have discussed donation options--where and how to donate or sell. As it is, this book perpetuates an already disposable-minded generation. At one point she talks about saving a file of her favorite quotes by tearing pages out of books then throwing the books away. Gross. Am I supposed to applaud that or want to emulate that? That certainly wouldn't give me joy. She is not only OCD, but she keeps insisting her methods of organizing are ""the proper way"". Minimalism, in her mind, leads to a slimmer figure, a happier countenance. Um, what about artists like me who NEED to keep papers and supplies for projects? I was hoping to get organizing ideas. Instead I got ""use a shoebox"". Seriously? If I threw away my supplies, I'd have to go out and buy new every time I started a new project. I might not need that paint for another two years, but I'll probably get around to using it, so I'm keeping it. Too, I get a lot of joy from stuff. I love memorial projects that utilize trinkets from childhood, photographs, old letters. Few things are more important to me. The author seems as cold as I imagine her surroundings to be, devoid of sentimentality and depth. She also several times references peer pressure to not keep silly things as it's embarrassing. Or she's embarrassed by items she saved in the past. What? She also goes into depth about inanimate objects having feelings. Dump out the contents of your purse every night, she says. Tell it you appreciate all the work it has done today, and give it a rest. Um, cue cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs sound. What the serious fuck? Granted, there are some cultural differences. I can understand feng shui and its value, along with manifesting and all that. But results are going to come from my attitude and action, not from talking to my house and my drawers. It's ironic that she gives objects empathy and yet easily discards them. ""Even if you throw it away or burn it (page 192), it will only leave behind the energy of wanting to be of service. Freed from its physical form, it will move about your world as energy, letting other things know that you are a special person..."" Uh, sounds like a way to assuage guilt to me. How about donating it instead?Cultural differences are also reflected in saying dry your sponges out on your veranda. Um, most of us don't have a veranda in the US, and we sure as Hell ain't drying our sponges outside.Cons: Joy isn't just in things we ""need"". Joy comes in many forms for many different reasons, and none of those reasons are ""wrong"". Comments like, ""you will never use spare buttons"" (page 111) is ludicrous for someone who sews, for example.Some ideas are just idiotic, like taking all the pics out of your photo albums so you can toss some. What a waste of time, and what a sad loss when you'll wish you had those back in the future. I personally can't fathom throwing photos away. ""The meaning of a photo lies in the excitement and joy you feel when taking it"" (page 119). Uh, tell that to Ansel Adams. Pfffssshhh. Pros: The idea of keeping only the objects that spark joy makes sense. Also the idea of creating a sanctuary space is true.Overall, I found her judgmental, with an idea that objects=garbage, and a sterile space is a good space. Her way or the highway. This coming from someone who grew up cleaning her room for fun, instead of playing with other kids. I don't understand the popularity of this book, nor the de-cluttering trend people are wearing like a badge of honor. Also in her rush to eliminate the idea of using any fancy storage methods, she misses the point that a lot of paper that people are saving can be scanned into computer files (saved recipes, for example), or onto Pinterest boards. Not everything should be thrown away. Objects are reflections of people's personalities, and the more the merrier in my opinion. I might enjoy looking at a minimalist space, but I would never want to live in one. I lived with a woman once who wouldn't allow any items on the countertops, no magnets on the fridge. The place was a cold as she was, and I moved out in two months. No thank you. people might have second thoughts or rebound if stuff was still in the vicinity.

326,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,Rating 4 out of 5,"I suspect that I did not read this book for the same reason as most people. A friend recommended it as, basically, I am off-brand British amateur Marie Kondo. I’d already watched her netflix series, indeed I re-watch it when I need to calm down. That show taught me her folding approach, which I’ve since applied and adore, but everything else she says just seems like common sense that I’ve been applying since childhood. Thus reading her book was slightly spooky at times, because Marie Kondo and I do seem rather like kindred spirits. We both love tidying and have very similar attitudes to possessions. I too store my handbags inside other bags; keep only items that inspire joy and/or are vitally important; have a clear sense of when I have too many possessions and need a clearout; keep everything in a specific place; store categories of items together; consider a clearout a special event; dislike piling things; keep only one box of childhood stuff at my parents house; and generally try to own as little as possible because I'm happier that way. Although Marie Kondo’s philosophy is influenced by shinto, about which I know nothing, it definitely echoes my feelings. She mentions saying goodbye to possessions with thanks and belief that they might come back in another form. This is analogous to my attitude when giving things to charity shops: I believe in a sort of charity shop cycle. The more that you donate, the more likely you are to find useful bargains yourself. The main difference is that Marie Kondo has monetised her tidiness in a massively successful manner, while I’ve helped my friends and parents with clearouts in return for meals. Kudos to her on that. I can’t imagine making a job out of tidying, though. It’s just a thing I do reflexively, as housemates tend to find. It’s harder for me to leave things on the floor than pick them up. As to where I diverge from Marie Kondo, there are a few minor things in the book that I do differently. Rather than keeping all papers in a single file, I have two: one for papers on my home (mortgage, insurance, etc) and one for papers about me (student loans, bank accounts, etc). I keep unread books for longer than she suggests, as long as they still spark joyful anticipation, because experience suggests I will read them eventually. I also disagree that women’s pyjamas should be ‘feminine’. I think that above all they should be warm and comfortable - that’s what sparks joy for me. Otherwise, though, I basically agree with her whole approach and found her explanation of it charming and readable. Tidying and donating excess possessions are fun! I’m very glad that these ideas are becoming mainstream.Prior to discovering Marie Kondo, the nearest thing I’d come across to an articulation of my attitude to possessions was Bruce Sterling’s  2008 last Viridian note. Although environmental impact in not mentioned in ‘The Life-changing Magic of Tidying’, it seems implicit that Marie Kondo’s approach deters wasteful overconsumption. The book focuses on being mindful of the possessions you already have, while developing a habit of tidiness that deters further unnecessary purchases. She emphasises consideration of why something was purchased, even if it was never worn/used/read. The flexibility of her approach is its great strength: no specific quantity of possessions or draconian storage strategy is presented. I find this much more appealing and realistic than 100-possessions-type minimalism. Not only will different people wish to own different quantities of clothes, books, and so on, the appropriate amount of possessions will vary at different stages of life. Now that I own my flat, I need a toaster, kettle, and microwave. Previously I rented places where the landlord or my housemates provided them. I agree with Marie Kondo that it’s important to develop a sense of how much stuff you as a person want to own, in the context of where and how you live. The appropriate level should be internally rather than externally determined. Her evangelism about tidiness as a route to changing your life for the better amuses me, though. Just because I’ve always been tidy does not mean I’ve always known what I want from life. Indeed, that’s something I’m still struggling to work out. Knowing where to find things is nonetheless very reassuring and useful. Rearranging my bookshelf is the ultimate anti-anxiety activity, one that I highly recommend. My shelves are sometimes ordered by read/unread, by fiction/non-, or by spine colour. I don’t mind which; the important thing is knowing exactly where to find what I’m looking for. Marie Kondo gets that."
327,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3932939-elliot,Rating 5 out of 5,"I was one of those people who made fun of this book when it came out. I watched it fly off shelves and take over the cultural dialogue, and I thought it was silly. Why all this hubbub about cleaning up your house? C'mon people, this isn't revolutionary - just clean your damn house. Well, here I am a couple years later, and...I was so wrong. This book, and I genuinely from the bottom of my heart mean this, changed my damn life. I'm only halfway through completing my home, but I've already noticed seismic shifts in my thinking and mood. KonMari isn't about cleaning. Not really. This is about examining your relationships with objects, and how the way you interact with the things in your life reflects other deeper patterns. I've learned so much about myself through this process. It has been deeply illuminating, and rewarding. And hey, at the end of the process you have a tidy space that makes you more happy. I haven't felt this light in decades. Not everything in this book resonated with me, but the process speaks for itself. There are some details that work for me and some that don't. (I'm never going to be the type of person that empties their entire purse every day when they get home, or thanks a toothbrush before throwing it away.) Kondo's Shinto influence is strong throughout this book and may turn some people off. But, and I can't stress this enough, there is something to be learned in examining how we interact with our possessions. So yeah, I get why people make fun of this, but I encourage them to try it all the same."
328,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1922261-cathy-douglas,Rating 5 out of 5,"Half of a book is philosophy and technique, half a truly odd little autobiography. Marie Kondo spent her childhood tidying. It truly fascinated her. She would do things like go into her older brother's room and throw away a bunch of his stuff. Yikes! Somehow she survived to adulthood.I was pleasantly surprised to find there was no big attempt to Americanize the US version of the book, and that the tidying methods embody a Shinto worldview: the whole world is animated with spirits, and one should treat those spirits with respect. For example, a purse ""wants"" to serve us, and so is disappointed if it sits year after year at the bottom of a drawer. Or if we use this purse, it will become tired by the end of the day; we should thank it, unpack it and allow it to rest.Some people think this is crazy. But is it crazy to talk to cats? Cats have no idea what we're talking about, or what's the point of all the gaba gaba gaba that comes out of our mouths. But we talk to them anyway, as a way to show our love. It's comforting on both sides. Stretching this further: Say you've got a CD you bought ten years ago which you loved, and which quickly became your favorite. For a while it was the soundtrack of your life. Even now, a decade later, you have all the songs on your iPod and listen to one occasionally. But you don't remember the last time you played to the physical CD, or even listened the album the whole way through. The CD sits on the shelf collecting dust, but you can't bring yourself to get rid of something you loved that much. Kondo's solution is to express your love and gratitude to the CD, then to let it go, because keeping such items is a symptom of our desire to live in the past. I think that makes a certain amount of sense.I remember how much it hurt to throw away my last pair of Adidas Grete Waitz racing flats. I've got oddly shaped feet, and those were the only shoes that have ever fit them perfectly. Those shoes were also light and fast; I ran most of my best races in them, and a lot of speed workouts with my team (the mighty Impalas). But the company stopped making them, and pretty soon I was down to one pair that was too worn out to use for anything but gardening. Then they got too holey even for that. It felt so mean, so disrespectful, so unloving just to toss them in the trash. I wish I had thought to express my gratitude. And yes, I really think that would make a difference. If nothing else, it would make a better memory.Getting back to emptying out your bag at the end of the day: My first reaction was, ""Seriously? Maybe I'm going to clean up my house this way she outlines, but no way I'm emptying out my pack every day and put the same stuff back in the next day."" But a few days later, I've noticed how before I go out of the house, I have to check and double check to make sure I have keys, pens, hair ties, etc. etc. etc. And I don't always need exactly the same items; some days I need the bike lock and lights, other days I need my bus ticket and Kindle. Maybe it actually would be easier and make me feel more secure to keep all my ""backpack stuff"" in one place, and load in only what I need before I leave the house. And hey, if it helps my hard-working backpack relax...Anyway, we'll see how well this works. My tidying binge starts tomorrow. The KonMari method will require a little Americanizing and other personalizing to work for me. For one thing, I don't believe the word ""basement"" appears anywhere in the book. Maybe Japanese houses don't have basements? My house's unfinished basement is the place where things I'm not using go so I don't have to look at them. Ugh -- it'll take some work. She doesn't have anything to say about outdoor spaces like my shed, and surprisingly doesn't go into much detail about kitchens. I also need to spend some time tidying digital devices, and my ""home office"" (which is really just a corner of the living room). While the book doesn't spell out how to do these things, it shouldn't be too hard to generalize the method to make it work across various spaces.I'm also curious how to implement this method with items like my boot socks. They're pretty well worn out, and handling them certainly gives me no ""frisson of joy."" By KonMari standards that should put them in the ""throw out"" pile. But I live in Wisconsin, and it's winter, and I need a pair of boot socks. It would be nice to buy a new pair, but there are a whole lot of things like that I need, and I don't have a lot of money. Those threadbare socks will have to last through the season.Still, after reading this book, I feel ready to take such issues more seriously. Another level of organization might be to make a list of little things I need, like boot socks, and write a budget that gives me a small allowance to buy them one at a time. And maybe it wouldn't hurt to listen to my boot socks' story. Just because I live in America doesn't mean my world's not full of spirits. People who see things that way are likely to take better care of their environment, both in the home and outside it.When Americans criticize ourselves, often the first thing we condemn is our materialism. So do we really need to show more love for consumer goods? Simplifying, getting rid of excess stuff -- that's all very well, but doesn't it kind of negate this if we start fetishizing the stuff we have? I don't think so. Inanimate objects do come with strings attached -- strings of human feeling that attach them to us and tug us in certain directions. Just outside my window there's a bike lying in my neighbor's backyard. A kid's bike that's been there for months, and is now stuck in ice. Today there's more snow falling, and now there's only a bit of the front wheel sticking up. It makes me sad every time I look at it."
329,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/77682337-myriam,Rating 2 out of 5,"Je reste sur ma faim en refermant ce livre. Je m’attendais à des conseils magiques...et là flop! Je reformulerai plutôt le titre « l’art de tout jeter pour avoir moins à ranger ».Au final, Je suis très dubitative et perplexe par les conseils donnés par Marie Kondo: jeter avant de ranger, remercier les objets pour la joie qu’ils nous apportent car les objets inanimés ont aussi une âme...Un fois terminé, je m’interroge encore sur l’utilité de ce livre en pratique. Et le recyclage dans tout çà, on en parle... De plus, ce livre se répète énormément ce qui alourdi la lecture.Je suis contente d’avoir lu son célèbre ouvrage (par curiosité) mais malheureusement je n’ai pas accroché et il n’a en aucun cas transformer ma vie de façon spectaculaire..."
