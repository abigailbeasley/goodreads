0,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2993027-dougal,Rating 1 out of 5,"I realise I'm in minority here but I really didn't enjoy this book at all. As a result of all the rave reviews I bought a copy for both myself and a friend - we were both hugely disappointed.The author, Christopher McDougall, is an American magazine correspondent and this perhaps goes someway to explain a lot of what I didn't like about the book. To begin with, it is written in a totally 'omniscient' manner, ie McDougall can see inside everyone's head. This is excessive, continuous, and extends right across the board from events to which he was privy, through events to which he was not, on to imagined `eureka moments' of various research scientists. In a similar manner, he describes events from the past, where he wasn't present, in a way he clearly feels will paint some sort of picture: eg `Then she wiped her greasy mouth on her sports bra, burped up some Dew, and bounded off'. Maybe she did wipe her mouth on her sports bra, but it seems doubtful, and I feel quite sure she never gave him an account, years later, of her burp. In a similar vein I confess that I didn't like the continuous use of words like `chomp' instead of `eat' and `chug' instead of `drink'. I imagine that is just a difference in usage when comparing opposite sides of the Atlantic but I did find myself wishing someone would just 'eat' something! And I do wonder if the use of block capitals as well as italics was really necessary. I am not talking about the start of each chapter but sentences like:'...I remember thinking What in the HELL? How in the HELL is this possible? That was the first thing, the first CHINK IN THE WALL, that MAYYYBEE modern shoe companies don't have all the answers...' (nine of those lowercase words are in italics, which I can't format here).So, we clearly have a very fictionalised account. But is any of it complete fiction? Well, yes it is. We are told on page 16 that the Tarahumara `barely eat any protein at all'. Well, with a physiology degree to back it up, I can tell you that leads only one way... to wasting and eventual death. It comes as a bit of a surprise then to be told on page 209 that `the traditional Tarahumara diet exceeds the United Nations' recommended daily intake [for protein] by more than 50 percent'. Perhaps by page 209 we are expected to have forgotten what he wrote earlier.On page 157 we are told, in relation to qualifying for the Boston Marathon that `...99.9 percent of all runners never will...'. Really? And how was that figure arrived at? For any average runner who puts in training, qualifying for Boston (like me!) is not difficult: 20,000 runners run it every year -- not qualify, which will be many, many times more -- actually run it. The implication behind his figure is that only 1 in 1000 marathoners who would specifically like to qualify do, ie 19,980,000 don't, which is clearly rubbish. His misuse of percentages crops up several times. It is patronising to the reader to assume that he doesn't understand what a percentage means. And it makes one more than doubt when we are told figures like '...70 to 80 percent..'. A particular problem with this is that it sounds as if he is being authorative when, in fact, he's not.His problem with Math(s) unfortunately isn't limited to the use of hyperbole with percentages. He unwittingly shows his problem, in typical journalistic style, in rather stark detail! On page 239, to work out how much older than 27 is an age that is equivalent to the increase in age from 19 to 27, he has to get out his notebook!!: `All righty. I flipped my notebook to a blank page and started jotting numbers. It takes....[I'll spare you the next four lines]...' He comes up with 36. Point made.But it is the disingenuous nature of much of his writing that I really took exception to. I will give two examples:One: who do you think ran the fastest?(a)	Page 15: `Lance Armstrong is one of the greatest endurance athletes of all time, and he could barely shuffle through his first marathon despite sucking down an energy gel nearly every mile.'(b)	Page 157: `...Ted...transformed himself...into...a barefoot marathoner with such speed that he was able to accomplish something that 99.9 percent of all runners never will: he qualified for the Boston Marathon.' [I've already talked about the 99.9 percent]Answer: We don't know because we aren't told their times. Well, I can tell you: Lance Armstrong, by a long way. In 2006 his 'shuffle' resulted in a time of 2:59:36 and he came 868th out of 37,866 finishers; a brilliant result for a first marathon (and ten minutes under the very fastest age group Boston qualifying time)! And Barefoot Ted? In 2006 he completed the Boston Marathon in 3:20:16, coming in 3,848th out of 19,682 finishers. Not a shuffle either, but in a completely different, and slower, league. In fact, to refer to a result under three hours (faster than seven minutes a mile) as a shuffle is just gratuitiously insulting. McDougall seems to have a downer on Armstrong, as he slates him elsewhere in the book - the reason never becomes apparent.Two: Why do you think `...Abele Bikila - the Ethiopian marathoner who ran barefoot over the cobblestones of Rome to win the 1960 Olympic marathon...' didn't wear shoes? - we are told this interesting fact in a paragraph about Barefoot Ted researching the benefits of barefoot running. Well, I can tell you, although the book doesn't, that it wasn't anything to do with the benefits of barefoot running. What we aren't told in the book is that Abele Bikila had an upset before the 1960 marathon and couldn't find a pair of shoes to fit and decided to chance running barefoot as he had trained that way; nor are we told that he chose to run in shoes at the subsequent 1964 Olympics.On the subject of barefoot running, it's interesting that the photograph on the back of the hardback edition shows five runners, presumably principal characters from the book, all wearing running shoes.Turning to the so called `scientific research' that McDougall is fond of reporting, again we must doubt a lot of what we are told. Why? Because it is presented in a way we can't trust. Yes, some of it may be true, but how much? And how much are we being presented with information that is propounded as fact or we are led to believe shows one thing, but may show something else? Just one set of examples will make the general point:Page 170: `...no matter how much you run, your odds of getting hurt are the same.' This is utter rubbish and is clearly so, using reductio ad absurdum, apart from all the evidence to the contrary.Page 171: `Is any shoe manufacturer prepared to claim that wearing their distance running shoes will decrease your risk of...injuries...[or]...improve your distance running performance?' No shoe manufacturer followed up the [Dr Richard's] challenge. The conclusion is drawn that `running shoes don't make you go faster and don't stop you from getting hurt..' This is absolute twaddle and I won't insult anyone's intelligence by explaining why.Page 172: The conclusion that McDougall draws from a study that found that ""Wearers of expensive running shoes...are injured significantly more frequently than runners wearing expensive shoes..."" is the following: `What a cruel joke: for double the price, you get double the pain.' Possibly, possibly. Could it just be that the buyers of more expensive shoes are those runners who push the boundaries of their training more aggressively? Unfortunately, the whole book is stuffed with this sort of biased writing dressed up as 'scientific fact'; we are used to it in the popular press -- we get a bookful here. For those of you interested in the 'science', I recommend reading this: http://www.hfs-clinics.co.uk/blog/pod...I could go on, about the very dubious anthropological details, nutrition and hydration anomalies etc, but I have written too much already.The book is just an adventure story, fiction based on fact; enjoy it if you can stomach the style; just take everything with a very big pinch of salt![For anyone considering it, at the very least don't purchase the Kindle edition: there is a spelling mistake on the first page that doesn't bode well for the rest of the book (the spelling mistake is not there in the print edition).]"
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,Rating 4 out of 5,"Let me begin this review by saying that I am not, and never have been, a runner. Despite that fact, I was surprisingly fascinated by Chrisopher McDougall's account of how his desire to run without pain started him on a quest that led him both deep into Mexico's remote Copper Canyons and human evolutionary past.Born to Run begins as an adventure story. While trying to figure out how to get his own foot to stop hurting, he saw an article about a tribe of Mexican Indians called the Tarahumara. These people were said to be able to run for days at a time through unforgiving terrain wearing nothing more on their feet than sandals made from thin strips of tire rubber. So McDougall set out to find these mysterious people, but doing so was not easy. The Copper Canyons where they live are extremely difficult to get to, and the trip is made even more hazardous by having to pass through drug farming country on the way. In addition to being a sometimes nail-biting tale about the author's quest to find the Tarahumara, Born to Run also weaves in the fascinating history of the sport of ultra-running. Ultra-marathons are races consisting of any distance longer than a marathon. McDougall discusses how this crazy sport first came into being, highlighting along the way the stories of the participants who have slowly begun to make it famous.McDougall narrates this history in real time, resulting in descriptions of several races that were so gripping I couldn't put the book down. One of these races was the Leadville Trail 100, a 100-mile race at 11,000 feet in which the Tarahumara faced off against an ultra-running prodigy named Ann Trason.As McDougall weaves together the story of ultra-running's past with his own quest to find the Tarahumara and become a better runner, he also relays a fascinating tale about scientific discoveries into our evolutionary past suggesting that it was our ability to run long distances without getting winded, and thus get all that extra protein from the bounding antelope we were able to outlast, that gave us the evolutionary edge needed to grow our huge brains. These sections also point out that we did not evolve to run on cushions with arch support, and that expensive running shoes may actually make runners more prone to injury than running in the bare feet nature so elegantly designed for us.The book concludes with the tale of a joint venture between McDougall and a character named Caballo Blanco, a gringo who had befriended the Tarahumara and made the Copper Canyons his home. Though the Tarahumara had wowed people at Leadville, Caballo longed to see them race against America's ultra-running best on their own turf. So McDougall helped him get together a half-dozen racers and they made the dangerous trek down into the canyons. The resulting race and the sportsmanship described therein is very moving, and I finished this odd combination of memoir, sports history, adventure tale and evolutionary science with damp eyes. AddendumNot quite a year after reading this book, I've been contemplating that question GR asks in the review process – ""How did this book change your life?"" because, quite unexpectedly, this book has arguably changed my life more than any I've ever read.It started because my geekish husband, a runner, decided he needed to figure out how to make huaraches, the thin, rubber-and-lace sandals worn for long races by the Tarahumara. He made some for himself, and for me, and a few other people in the Boulder Barefoot Club, and then a lot more people in the Boulder Barefoot Club, until finally, the BB Club's founder Michael Sandler, said, ""Why don’t you just put up a web site?"" Steven hemmed and hawed, but Michael, who was about to publish his own comprehensive book on barefoot running (called, appropriately enough, Barefoot Running: How to Run Light and Free by Getting in Touch with the Earth, said if we had a website, he'd put it in his book. And of course, who doesn't want to be in a book?Via the magic of the Interwebs, we soon found ourselves selling huaraches and DIY kits at http://Xeroshoes.com (which, in the decade since I first wrote this, has now grown to include a full line of minimalist shoes, boots and sandals in both casual and performance styles) to people in all 50 states and countries on six out of seven continents (we'd like to go for seven out of seven, but I'm not holding out much hope for barefoot-style running taking off in Antarctica). In the process, I, a walker, not a runner, have found that wearing these shoes, which allow me to intimately feel the ground and get the immediate feedback that forces me to adjust my slightly lopsided gait and have better form, have forever ruined me for other footwear, which now feels like wearing bricks on my feet. So in less than 12 months, our lives have completely reorganized themselves around the process of doing everything we can to get the word out about huaraches and the overall ""natural movement"" movement and its recognition that expensive, highly structured athletic shoes are not your friend. It's a huge project, one that has me working harder than I have in a decade. And, irony of ironies, it is also one that has left me with far less time to read than I had a year ago.Damned life-changing books."
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/233448-aaron,Rating 3 out of 5,"With its excessive hyperbole, convenient omissions, misleading statistics, logical inconsistencies and plain old errors, I stopped thinking about this book as actual journalism after fifty pages. Trying to read it as a novel wasn't that satisfying either because the book reads like several magazine pieces glued together rather than one continuous work. The personality profiles of Jenn and Billy and the screed against running shoes felt particularly extraneous. However, the book has a fun core of semi-mystical lost knowledge and its someone-recently-brainwashed-to-a-weird-secular-cult tone made the book enjoyable."
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,Rating 4 out of 5,"You don't stop running because you get old; you get old because you stop running.After hearing my running friends rave about this book for years, I finally got around to reading it. And now I owe them an apology, because I had gotten so sick of being preached at about chia seeds and running barefoot and vegetarianism and ultramarathons that I have been quietly rolling my eyes whenever anyone mentioned this friggin book. But once I got into the story, all of my eye rolls stopped. Sure, there were a few groans about McDougall's punchy, magazine-writing style that doesn't always translate well to book form, but overall, this was an engrossing read. It covers a motley cast of outdoorsy characters from America and Mexico, including the elite runners of the elusive Tarahumara Indian tribe, several incredible foot races, research on running and training methods, and there is even a captivating digression into how the Bushmen of the Kalahari go hunting. At its heart, the story is about human endurance, compassion for others, and the theory that our bodies were ""born to run."" There is a thoughtful chapter on the evolution of homo sapiens from other mammals, and the ways in which the human form is designed to be able to cover an incredible amount of distance. ""Know why people run marathons? Because running is rooted in our collective imagination, and our imagination is rooted in running. Language, art, science; space shuttles, Starry Night, intravascular surgery; they all had their roots in our ability to run. Running was the superpower that made us human -- which means it's a superpower all humans possess.""As mentioned, there are also sections on the nutritional power of chia seeds, vegetarianism, and a training theory that runners should spend more time barefoot to build up their strength. I won't lecture you about any of that as I had found it exhausting when others preached to me (there is a line between enthusiasm and evangelism), but I did find the information interesting and will take it under advisement. Along the way, McDougall shares his own stories of running injuries and how he found different trainers to teach him ways to run more efficiently and with more joy. Yes, joy. ""How do you flip the internal switch that changes us all back into the Natural Born Runners we once were? Not just in history, but in our own lifetimes. Remember? Back when you were a kid and you had to be yelled at to slow down? Every game you played, you played at top speed, sprinting like crazy as you kicked cans, freed all, and attacked jungle outposts in your neighbors' backyards ... That was the real secret of the Tarahumara: they'd never forgotten what it felt like to love running. They remembered that running was mankind's first fine art, our original act of inspired creation. Way before we were scratching pictures on caves or beating rhythms on hollow trees, we were perfecting the art of combining our breath and mind and muscles into fluid self-propulsion over wild terrain ... Distance running was revered because it was indispensable; it was the way we survived and thrived and spread across the planet. You ran to eat and to avoid being eaten; you ran to find a mate and impress her, and with her you ran off to start a new life together. You had to love running, or you wouldn't live to love anything else.""The narrative builds to an amazing foot race in the blazing hot Copper Canyons of Mexico, with some top American athletes competing against a group of Tarahumara runners. Friends, I would be lying if I said I made it through that incredible story without getting choked up by the beauty of what happened that day. I could share quotes, but I think you need to read it in context and experience the grit and grace and humanity for yourself. This book was so inspiring that I vowed to make an effort to go running more often. And I shall run with joy and compassion in my heart.Update May 2021I've been in the mood for running books lately and decided to re-read ""Born to Run"" by listening to it on audio. I really enjoyed my re-read, and enough time had passed since I had first read it that I had forgotten some key events, so it all seemed fresh and new again. Highly recommended."
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-ms-feisty,Rating 2 out of 5,"Painful as it was, I stayed with this until slightly past the halfway mark. I kept hoping I might learn more about the Tarahumara people, but it was not to be. There's very little about the Tarahumara, and almost everything about a bunch of self-absorbed, obsessive long-distance runners. I have no patience with extreme athletes. They need to strive for some balance in their lives. The sport is not everything. I also got tired of the ""gee golly wow ain't it all just lipsmackingly wild and amazing!!!"" reporting style. A little more objectivity and a lot less hipness, Mr. McDougall."
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/372363-books-ring-mah-bell,Rating 5 out of 5,"Truly, I cannot recall the last time I read a book that I loved as much as this.Should you think this book is for serious runners alone, please think again. I am not by any means a runner. I ran track in high school, but the runs I did were short, sweet, sprints. After high school, I had a difficult time finding 200 yard dashes to race in, so I did a few 5k's... I didn't love them much at all. There was no way I was going to win a 5k, not ever. The distance just sucked. (In retrospect, some training may have helped.) I looked at most distance runners as mentally ill - something was wrong with those people. They were running from something, I decided, maybe from being fat, or being sad, maybe running from addictions or desires. Nuts. All of them. (Maybe I was just jealous of their slow twitch muscle fibers.) Most of the time I found the races to be miserable, and looking at most of the runners, it seemed they did too. Grimaces, frowns, bloody nipples, knee braces... yeah, FUN!This book jogged my memory of those few times I did find running to be fun. One of those times was during a 5K called ""Hair of the Frog"", put on by a local brewery. It was early spring, it was cold, raining ice, There was thunder and lightning. I'm not sure if it was oxygen deprivation, or perhaps that amazing runner's high, but midway through the race, I was in nirvana. The trees around me looked beautiful encased in ice. I felt.... amazing. Alive. Primal. It did not matter that I was not going to win this race. (In fact, this race even had an award for finishing DFL, Dead F-ing Last.) It was then that I got it. I understood why some people really love to run. Had it not been for the pints of beer waiting at the finish line, I'm pretty sure I would have rerun the course with glee. Over time, I forgot about that sensation, busy with life, I rarely ran. I remember now. Author Christopher McDougall writes about and participates in extreme adventure sports. He struggles with running injuries. The doctors suggest shots, orthotics, and offer the advice, ""if it hurts, stop doing it."". While in Mexico on an assignment, McDougall discovers the Tarahumara, an anthropological gem - a superhuman species, hidden deep in the formidable Sierra Madres. These people run extreme distances, and they run into old age, when the rest of the world resigns to rocking chairs. McDougall sets out to find these people, to discover how they run without injury, how they continue to run into old age. In the process, meets a man, Caballo Blanco, who wants to set up a race between these superhumans and the elite ultra runners of the United States.There is so much more to this book than people running. This book talks about culture, society, obsession, science. One of the most compelling parts of the book - the evidence presented that we are indeed born to run. One scientist points to the nuchal ligament on the back of our skulls, which fast moving animals have to keep the head in place while running. The topic of persistence hunting comes in to support the point and it is utterly fascinating. Running on two legs may not make us as fast as the quadripeds, but it does allow us to breathe more efficiently. And all these fabulous sweat glands we have? We can run longer without overheating, unlike the mammals not as well equipped with such a cooling system. we may not be fast enough to run down a deer in minutes, but after enduring for several miles, we can overtake the deer as it drops from overheating and exhaustion.The cast of characters is simply amazing. I have already mentioned my thought that serious runners are a bit off in the head. The group of ultrarunners mentioned in the book may make the case for me. We meet Jenn and Billy, two surfer kids turned ultrarunners, that party all night to the point of puking, and get a few hours of sleep (by passing out) and rise, ready to go for a VERY long run. Jack Kirk, an elderly trail runner, is mentioned briefly, but was so fascinating I had to google him. ( http://runtrails.blogspot.com/2007/02... ) There's Barefoot Ted, running trails sans shoes (or if his feet need protection, he uses Vibram Five Fingers). And the mastermind behind the race, Caballo Blanco, a gringo who indeed was running from something.This story is so, SO worth reading.The only thing that could have improved the book... pictures.Now, if you'll excuse me, there's a trail calling me to run.Maybe I am a runner after all."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8721294-nicholas-sparks,Rating 5 out of 5,"This has to be one of my favorite books of the last few years. It's non-fiction, but it reads like a thrilling adventure, complete with a high-octane conclusion, all with a bit of science thrown in. It's a fantastic look at the sport of ultra-distance running, but trust me when I say that once you start reading, it's impossible to put down."
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1209727-mike,Rating 1 out of 5,"Oh man, did this book stink. In the words of Eric Cartman, ""Goddamn hippies!"" This book was a weird mixup of topics: Mexican-Indian runners, American ultrarunners, humans evolution is based on running, running shoes are bad for you, salad for breakfast is the way to go, Nike is evil, everything in life would be better if we all ran way more, etc... You get the idea. I think I would have liked this book if it had been an history of the Mexican tribal runners. Instead McDougall makes an effort to show how every facet of life is or should revolve around running. Classic case of ""way too immersed in a subject to have any perspective."" Also, the ""hero"" of the book is a guy who spent some time in Boulder (shocking!), gets divorced, drops out of life, moves to Mexico, lives in a hut, runs a lot, and returns to Boulder during the summer to do some ""freelance furniture-moving jobs"" (hilarious description, the author's words) for cash. I was impressed by his ability to organize the race that is the focus of the book, but was so annoyed by the way the author portrayed him as some kind of modern anti-hero who really has life figured out. The last line of the book is his; ""Running should be free, man."" I'm guessing he's really bummed that drugs aren't.I've edited this review several times, because it's gotten way too long. I could tear this book apart page-by-page, it's so obnoxious. But I'll let you read it and see for yourself, or better yet, skip it."
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,Rating 3 out of 5,I have been trying to get better at running (trying being the operative word) and someone recommended this book when I was talking to them. The book definitely made me want to stick with running and made me think about how it can actually be kind of fun. I also keep straining my calf so I might try out minimalistic running shoes and see if that helps. I did find the way running is framed as some sort of panacea for the worlds ills to be a bit much though. Also the style of writing is something that I've kind of grown tired of but it's unfortunately the way a lot of contemporary non fiction is written. 
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote,Rating 4 out of 5,"Christopher McDougall hurt his legs running which sent him down a rabbit hole where he learned about ultrarunning (veeeeery long marathons), running barefoot and human physiology, and a mysterious tribe of Mexican running shamans called the Tarahumara. All of that information culminates in this book: Born to Run. Born to Run is a compelling book about the amazing world of ultrarunning. It’s populated with a number of extraordinary individuals - Emil Zatopek, Ann Trason, Scott Jurek, Jenn “Mookie” Shelton, Billy “Bonehead” Barrett - all of whom ran insane distances constantly, somehow, as well as the real stars of the book, the Tarahumara tribe, who can allegedly run over 400 miles in one go! He also covers the genesis and stories of punishing ultraraces like Leadville and the history of running shoes, how Nike got started, and how their product evolved over the decades to where we are now. I was expecting more science in this book than there was. He eventually gets around to explaining the meaning behind the title by looking at our early Homo Sapien ancestors who somehow outlasted Neanderthals and puts forward the theory that the reason for this was persistence hunting. That is, when the meat supply became smaller and more mobile post-Ice Age, Neanderthals couldn’t run to capture their prey but Homo Sapiens could chase after antelope for miles until the antelope collapsed - animals can’t regulate their body heat as well as humans - and so Homo Sapiens got their protein that way and continued to develop while Neanderthals couldn’t get enough protein and eventually died off. I don’t know enough about the subject to say whether or not this theory still holds water today (or if it ever did) but the running man theory is an interesting one regardless. And that’s the thing with McDougall - he’s a storyteller, not a scientist. So when he writes about the benefits of non-meat diets in long-distance running as well as doing it barefoot and the key to the Tarahumara’s endurance being pure enjoyment (it’s all in the head, man), I’m not sure how much to trust this information. Still, even if that information is shaky, I can see that it comes from a good place and the messaging isn’t totally bereft of usefulness. It might be worthwhile for some people who have foot/leg issues to try barefoot running as it seems to have helped many, including McDougall; eating less meat is probably a positive thing most of us could benefit from too; and finding simple enjoyment from experiences and our communities should be something we all strive for. Running is good for most of us and the human body is more capable of incredible things than we realise. That said, I’m not about to start running barefoot or give up animal protein either (though I have incorporated chia seeds in my diet, the Tarahumara’s secret ingredient to their endurance feats - like multivitamins, I can’t tell if it’s doing anything but I’ma keep it up anyway)! McDougall is a fine narrator and the book is often fun to read, even if the style gets a bit too novelistic at times. I’m sure he interviewed his subjects and then adapted their words into this easily-digestible story format, but I feel like it’s overly narrative-ish at times. Particularly in the structure of the book which culminates in a race through the Mexican canyons (with no real stakes) and the “reveal” of Caballo Blanco’s backstory (the “White Horse” - the chap who captured McDougall’s attention early on) who isn’t the towering presence in the book that McDougall thinks he is. It feels contrived, even corny, like a bad Hollywood movie. For me, this book is somewhere between three and four stars out of five but I’ll be generous and give it four as I enjoyed it more than not. Expect less of a detailed look at the science behind running and more of a series of fun stories about some remarkable ultrarunners. "
10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david-rubenstein,Rating 5 out of 5,"While I am not a runner, I found this book to be quite engaging. I can recommend it to anyone interested in running, indigenous peoples, or wacky characters!This book is about long-distance races over rugged, desert terrain. It is about a hidden tribe, the Tarahumara, who live in the Copper Canyone area of the Sierra Madre, a remote, desert region in Mexico. The tribe is very wary of strangers. They speak their own native language. They live in a rugged, wild country that takes days to reach. Just getting there is dangerous, as it involves evading drug runners and rugged, roadless desert terrain. It is a wonder that the tribe flourishes, because just getting from one village to another requires enormous athleticism and stamina. But this seems to be no problem for the Tarahumara, many of whom are superathletes. They frequently run enormous distances, over 100 miles, without a problem. They don't wear running shoes; they usually wear homemade sandals made of a thin strip of rubber.The main story is about a 50-mile race through Copper Canyon in a heat-scorching sun. Many colorful characters compete in the race. Their attitudes toward life and toward running are fun and often funny. I cannot imagine how some of them could have made it out of the desert alive at all, let alone made it across the finish line. The most surprising part of the book is the description of how high-end running shoes tend to slow runners down and make runners twice as prone to injuries as low-end shoes. Imagine their surprise when Nike employees visited a college track team, and saw that they were practicing barefoot. Running barefoot is less conducive to injuries that top-of-the-line running shoes!The antics of a couple of the characters in the book started to make me feel like this was just a sophomoric book about happy-go-lucky college kids. But there was enough interest in the book to keep me engaged to the very last page.I didn't read this book; I listened to the audiobook version. Fred Sanders is a very good reader, and his accents sounded realistic and help propel the story forward."
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5935491-tanja-berg,Rating 4 out of 5,"Nearly five years ago I started walking. As I got stronger, I progressed to running. Then came the winter of 2015-2016 when I had a cough that would not let up and consecutive colds. Plus I had a young dog. I went back to walking. Although my hikes were long, it wasn't quite the same and I started to regain the weight I had lost. Two months ago, I decided that enough was enough. If I wanted to avoid buying bigger clothes I would have to do something. Either run and see if that helps, or if that hadn't helped by Christmas, start going to the gym. Horror of horrors for an outdoors person such as myself. I exchanged my walks for interval runs and the effect was immediate. Within two weeks I could button all my blouses again and the black pants I couldn't button I had to wear a belt for. That was really as far as my weight loss scheme went, although I keep an eye on it still. What I discovered too was that rather than taking my usual routes faster, I would simply be out for my usual hour, hour and half - difference being that I covered a lot more ground. I found a world beyond my usual routes. I went up new trails in the woods I knew well. I went further. I discovered that after about ten kilometers, a joy surfaces that I didn't know I could feel. My weekend trail runs are now twenty km - a day. Not because it makes me thin, but because it makes me happy. It's the lull of the rythm while keeping an eye on roots and stones. It's the falling leaves, the landscape, the lakes. Today I came to a lake that had just frozen and frost had blown across the newly formed ice. The trees and moss and grass were white from frost. It was so incredibly beautiful that I teared up with gratitude for being able to be there and see it.This book ""Born to run"" is a fantastic story that confirms what I have discovered. We are, indeed, born to run long distances. It's a story about crazy ultra runners, for whom marathons are too short - they go much further. What they have found is a joy of running. There is also this funny chapter about how shoes have caused so much damage to us. It is better to run with cheap shoes that aren't padded because then the running style - landing on your padded forefoot - is easy on the body. Landing on your heels causes all kinds of problems, whether you are running with air padded shoes or not. I loved this book because it was an affirmation of what I have found on my cross country trails: happiness. "
12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/671638-sharon,Rating 4 out of 5,"What a weird, wonderful (true!) story. Upon finishing this, I spent the better part of the day on YouTube, looking for any additional information I could find on the Tarahumara tribe, chia seeds, Caballo Blanco, Scott Jurek, Ann Trason, the Leadville Trail Race, running barefoot, persistence hunting, even the author Christopher McDougall. It was everything I didn't know I needed to know about ultra-running, why we run, and the legends in the sport. The novel takes the reader on a wild and random trip, down multiple rabbit-holes, all subjects equally fascinating and Google-worthy. The cast of characters are unforgettable (runners/party animals Jenn Shelton and Billy Barnett—particularly Jenny—were an absolute delight). It culminates in one of the most interesting races I had never heard of.Terrific audiobook. I was sad when it was over.Note: Caballo Blanco passed away in 2012 (this is not mentioned in the book). Rest in Peace. What a beautiful soul. Reports say he was found in a canyon in New Mexico, very close to the way he said he hoped we would pass in the novel."
13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/764994-rick,Rating 2 out of 5,"McDougall is a journalist, a former war correspondent and current feature writer on extreme sports, like ultra-marathons. Born to Run has the virtues and faults of feature magazine writing, particularly when articles are either exploded to book length or several with thematic links are knitted together to comprise a single book. The book is by turns fascinating and aggravating. Part of the problem is McDougall’s tendency to hyperbole, which given the dramatic nature of the potential consequences to running 100 miles in a desert or the drama that should be inherent in top competitors racing each other in circumstance of high risk or landscape changes in evolutionary understanding, is a technique that seems not just unnecessary but undermining. Everyone can’t be the greatest, the toughest, the fastest. Every circumstance can’t be life-changing, world shattering, life or death. Instead of a journalist he comes across as a marketing man.Another part of the problem is McDougall has a school yard bully approach to storytelling—he uses the story-teller’s long arm advantage over the reader (he knows what’s coming; we’re reading to find out) to hold us at a distance, while he taunts with digressions, sidebars, and postponed payoffs, we swing away at the pages not getting where we want to get. The description of a Leadville ultra-marathon race that took place some years before the main events of the book goes on and on and several times I nearly went to the internet to find out the result because I was tired of flailing away while McDougall kept me waiting to indulge his sense of narrative fun. But there is fascinating stuff, often engrossingly told, about the Tarahumara, a remote tribe of Native Americans in Mexico who are capable of running non-stop and never are injured; about how running shoes contribute to running injuries, about how world-class ultra-marathon races are competitively coed, and about the theory that lends itself to the book’s title, that humans evolved to run, contrary to what most experts claim. So there is enough here to keep most readers going who are interested in running (my fiancée, who is not interested in running but was interested in the Tarahumara gave up half-way through the book) and this kind of pop-journalism. I liked what I learned but didn’t enjoy the learning all that much."
14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2882666-dan,Rating 3 out of 5,"A compelling read, brilliant story and fascinating subject matter, but somehow falls short of being a great book.I'm not sure where it goes wrong exactly, but for me it might have been the number of characters which I struggled to keep track of, the slightly preachy tone of the anti-shoe chapters (persuasive though they are) or the negative coverage of apparently less worthy ultra runners who dared to accept sponsorship or promote their own books. None of these, or other faults, completely spoil the experience of discovering the inspiring characters and insights contained within, but they detracted from it a bit for me at least. Despite its faults, I'm pumped up and ready to run having just put the book down. Given that it's midnight and I'm knackered, I think that means it has done something right. The case against overpriced running shoes is also extremely persuasive and has got me thinking about what my first pair of 'barefoot' shoes should be.All in all, well worth reading for the subject matter, but not quite the great book it could have been.

17,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,Rating 4 out of 5,"Fascinating tales of super runners, and some of the science of why some humans can do 100 mile running races, and even how we evolved from being a running race.The book starts with an investigation of why ""Up to eight out of every ten runners are hurt every year."", a notion that stands at odds with the fact that some people can run, and even compete in, races that are 26, 50, 100, and even 150 miles long. In particular, there is a race of people in Mexico, the Tarahumara who regularly do runs of those distances, over crazy hard terrain and in crazy hot temperatures. Clearly, these people have figured out how to run without injuring themselves, and how to do it while having FUN! Both of those are key.I'd heard about and read a little about proper running form being to not heel strike, but this put that into a new light. Aside from the Tarahumara running crazy distances in rubber sandals, there was this quote from legendary Stanford running coach Vin Lananna:""Coach Lananna walked over to explain. “I can’t prove this,” he explained, “but I believe when my runners train barefoot, they run faster and suffer fewer injuries.""Between that and the publication of this book, thus began the explosion of barefoot shoes (side note: anyone know how those things are selling these days?). Basically barefoot training forces your feet to land more gently, is how we evolved to run, and mucking with that by putting on big cushioned running shoes is why so many runners get injured. Thanks, Nike. Certainly worth trying.The Running Theory of Evolution was interesting too - what if humans became upright because we had evolved into the ultimate distance running machines, using that for millennia to hunt before we invented tools like the bow and arrow. It is possible to hunt a deer by running it down, but it takes ~4-6 hours - basically, marathon distance - hmmm... Also interesting is that all running animals (cheetah, dogs, horses, etc) can only take one breathe per stride because of the way their lungs work - we humans are the only ones who can take multiple.""Because if David was right, he’d just solved the greatest mystery in human evolution. No one had ever figured out why early humans had separated themselves from all creation by taking their knuckles off the ground and standing up. It was to breathe! To open their throats, swell out their chests, and suck in air better than any other creature on the planet.""So basically, we evolved into a running species and it's in our genes. Not all of us love it anymore because... well we don't need to run to survive anymore. But if you can dig in and discover how to do it properly, you might unlock a love of something that our bodies possibly actually ARE designed to do, despite a lot opinions to the contrary. Some distance runners and endurance athletes do what they do because they are trying to punish some demon inside themselves. But I think that running for the love of it is really the best message this book contains. That's why the Tarahumara have smiles on their faces as they run - something I'm going to keep in mind.""That was the real secret of the Tarahumara: they’d never forgotten what it felt like to love running."""

19,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1674518-laura-norton-cruz,Rating 4 out of 5,"Written in 2015: I read and wrote the review below in 2012. Since then, I've given it some more thought and had a few years now of running in huaraches (when trail conditions permit). My personal, anecdotal experience is that huaraches do make my recurrent ankle pain way less of a problem, and it just feels good. But I wear trails shoes when the trails have lots of little rocks. Also, I am still --and now, more -- annoyed at how little depth we got on the individual people of the Rarámuri, and how much we got of the intolerable Scott Jureck and Barefoot Ted. (Side note: When I went to buy running huaraches online, I considered Luna Sandals, but when I learned that Barefoot Ted, the owner, who learned to make them from Miguel Luna, as we learn in this book, does not share his profits with Miguel Luna or the RarámuI people, I was so pissed. Yay, more white people committing intellectual property theft from indigenous people, profiting off of their traditional knowledge...so I bought Xero Shoes instead, which give 10% of profits to schools in Rarámuri communities) And lastly, read the 1-star review of this book here on GoodReads by Dougal. It's great. It is very carefully researched and thought out so he noticed a lot of inconsistencies that I did not. Anyway, this book still did have a positive influence on my running and I really enjoyed it, so here is my 2012 review...Written in 2012: was spellbound by this book, and it has made me a much better runner. I have a lot of good things to say about why I enjoyed this book and how it is useful, but being the critical social thought major, feminist anti-racist indigenist social worker I am, I also have to share what I didn't like. I'll do that first to get it out of the way so I can return to why I loved it. Critique:Christopher McDougall is an incredibly skillful and beautiful writer, but he has an arrogant voice in much of the book, or at least the first part. It reminded me of Kai (sp?) Risdahl from NPR's Marketplace, who always sounds far too sure of himself. Sort of cocky and masculine and white American in a very un-self aware way. The arrogance faded as McDougall talked more about other people and revealed his own vulnerabilities as a runner and as a man, but some of the voice issues continued to irk me along the way. It was the way he described every running woman with some variation of wispy blond hair streaming off her face and bright blue eyes and gorgeous face... It was the way he didn't talk about his own wife and daughter barely at all (I kept wondering--how does this guy manage to do all this and be a partner and dad? How does his wife feel about him risking his life? I wanted him to address these things as a woman probably would in her book). It was the way he occasionally made casual comments that othered the Tarahumara (or Rarámuri, as they call themselves in their language) people about whom he otherwise wrote with great respect. And I guess I wish he got to know more of the Rarámuri more closely to be able to describe them as the complex individual parents/sons/daughters/farmers/runners/community members they are, in the way that he described so intimately the self-obsessed individual American ultra marathoners and the (in my opinion, quite lovable) gringo-indio, Caballo Blanco. So, I'd love to sit down with McDougall and talk some about gender and race and then send him on his way. Because I enjoyed what he was able to do with this book and I love the way he wrote it, for the most part. So on to that. Love:I love that this is the first book about sports that I've been able to get through and actually care deeply about the final race scene and almost cheer and applaud when the race was won. (I am an athlete, but generally don't like reading about athletics because I find most discussions very one-track-minded. This book, however, wove athletics into a much larger narrative and kept me on the edge of seat.) I loved the way McDougall wove scientific and historical journalism in with storytelling back and forth, back and forth. I loved--and was impacted by--the way he used the stories of The Rarámuri runners and the American and International runners to explore the research on running shoes and how we've been fooled into spending lots of money to get more injuries. I've been running barefoot more and more often these days when I can find the right kind of trails, a sort of return to my childhood, with the hope that this will lessen the likelihood of injury. I loved how he described his own journey to run better and particularly the discussion on form--it has made me far more conscious of my form as I run, and I notice that I too feel lighter and quicker and hurt less as a result. I loved especially how he tied what seems kind of ridiculous--marathon and ultra-marathon running--into a basic need for survival, making the argument, through anthropology and biology and history, that humans evolved to run long distances, to run down and tire out our prey. I love this. This idea in itself rejuvenates me as a runner, as did the engrossing story of the great race in the Barrancas del Cobre (Copper Canyon) of Northern México and all of the stories he shared of the races and runners that made the race possible. I should also note that I read this book as a runner, as someone who works with and for indigenous people, and as someone who was trying to make sense of her experience in las Barrancas del Cobre back in 2002. I was 20 years old and studying Spanish. My parents and sister and I went on a trip to las Barrancas. At the little modest lodge we stayed, they asked a local Rarámuri man named José to guide us on a hike. He took us (cold weather Alaskan athletes) on an 18 mile hike up and down mountains and through farms and yards and mud shacks and corn fields and mountain trails and past one abandoned cave dwelling in the heat of summer. We were hot and exhausted. He was not in the least bit phased. He was wearing cowboy boots and jeans, which, I didn't realize until I read Born to Run, I guess made him quite the assimilated Rarámuri man. I kept returning to those memories as I read this book, trying to piece together my brief experience with what McDougall describes, and with the reality of what narcotraficantes have done to the Barrancas since then. I didn't come out with clear answers, but McDougall's description of the history of the Rarámuri/Tarahumara people and of las Barrancas, and the ways he told his own stories of traveling there and of the race there, did help me make sense of it. In addition to worrying about the narcos and the Tarahuma, there is one thing that is left unsettled for me: I am worried about Jenn, ""la brujita,"" the young party girl utramarathoner from Virginia Beach. I am worried about her drinking and the danger she is in. I came to like her and worry about her, and wonder if McDougall worried too but didn't write it in the book, or didn't notice how unhealthy she was. Will have to research that one on my own. "
20,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10386400-ryan-holiday,Rating 5 out of 5,"I have a bad habit where I put off reading a book if I hear it recommended too many times. It stems from being underwhelmed by the flavor of the week long read (normally The New Yorker) or whatever blogs seem to be passing around and splooging all over. In the case of Born to Run, I made a mistake and I wish I'd read it sooner. No question it had plenty of the cringe-worthy moments I was reticent about, but it's worth reading anyway. Like The Tiger by John Valliant, there is a shocking amount of applicable and interesting evolutionary science in here, and from what I know it's all pretty legit.For a non-fiction book about running, it's very readable and interesting enough to keep you going even if you are not a runner. This is also its weakness; you can tell the writer's background as a magazine writer resigns him to a sort of pull-quote mentality and all the other obnoxious tricks that magazines employ. The idea that we evolved to run long distance (as opposed to only sprinting when fleeing predators) is something that I don't think has been properly accounted for in paleo-communities. Persistance hunting, for example, is something he discusses well in this book. That Taleb and others advocate only walking and never distance running has not sat well with me-they've never felt the accomplishment of slowly seeing your endurance grow; the rhythm your feet, lungs, music and heartbeat fall into on a long run; the commitment it takes to hit a goal day in and day out. This book is about those things and how deeply rooted they are in us. And how, ironically, the industry that surrounds running has done its best to destroy and undermine those feelings."

22,no user info,Rating 2 out of 5,"Interesting, but ultimately unsatisfying. The author writes from a ""seller"" perspective--he's trying to drum up business for his writing. There were several points in the book where I was completely convinced he was going to tell me to purchase Tahitian Noni drinks, or other nonsense. The story felt very sensationalized and pick-and-choose for the points that will help the book. Yes, he gave us several examples, but many times the examples seemed contradictory--the Tarahumara eat only a diet of XYZ, but then later here they are eating ABC, too. Running shoes wreck your feet/body, but even some of the extremist runners do fine with them. It is interesting to consider what will happen with running shoes in the future. I'm not ready to chuck my Asics--even recently I've noticed that when I walk around for several miles in flip-flops, my left heel absolutely kills. I throw on my Asics and voila! Pain gone, comfort back. I'm more of a mainstreamer and less of an innovator, so I'm not ready to run like Barefoot Ted."

Βέβαια δεν έχω τρέξει σε μαραθώνιο ακόμα και η μεγαλύτερη απόσταση που έχω διανύσει σε μια μέρα τρέχοντας είναι κάπου στα δεκαπέντε χιλιόμετρα, αν θυμάμαι καλά. Λοιπόν, το τρομερό βιβλίο του ΜακΝτούγκαλ με έκανε να πάρω αμέσως τα ταλαιπωρημένα μου παπούτσια και να πάω να τρέξω είκοσι χιλιόμετρα, έτσι, για αλλαγή. Εντάξει, δεν το έκανα ακόμα, αλλά το έχω σκοπό μέσα στις επόμενες μέρες. Είναι ένα φοβερό βιβλίο που μπορεί να παρακινήσει πολλούς ανθρώπους να αλλάξουν τρόπο και στάση ζωής, να αφήσουν πίσω την μαλθακότητα και την ανία, ν'αρχίσουν να τρέχουν σαν τρελοί σε γήπεδα, δρόμους, χωράφια και βουνά. Ο άνθρωπος γεννήθηκε για να κινείται με τα ποδαράκια του και εξελίχθηκε έτσι ώστε να μπορεί να τρέχει μεγάλες αποστάσεις. Δεν έχει σημασία πόσο γρήγοροι είμαστε, αρκεί να τρέχουμε. Με το τρέξιμο αθλούμαστε, κάνουμε ωραίο σώμα, αποκτούμε αντοχές, ηρεμούμε ψυχικά. Φυσικά εδώ το βιβλίο έχει να κάνει με κάτι τρελαμένους τύπους που τρέχουν δεκάδες χιλιόμετρα καθημερινά, που συμμετέχουν σε τρελούς αγώνες μεγάλων αποστάσεων σε ανώμαλες επιφάνειες (βουνά, φαράγγια κ.λ.π.), με το τρέξιμο να δίνει ένα νόημα στην ζωή τους και να είναι ένα από τα σημαντικότερα πράγματα γι'αυτούς. Ο ΜακΝτούγκαλ μας παίρνει από το χεράκι και μας ταξιδεύει στα απομονωμένα και απομακρυσμένα φαράγγια του Μεξικού και μας αποκαλύπτει μια φυλή Ινδιάνων, τους Ταραουμάρα, τα μέλη της οποίας έχουν το τρέξιμο στο καθημερινό τους πρόγραμμα. Είναι οι απόλυτοι δρομείς. Έχουν καλή υγεία, ζουν μια απλή ζωή μακριά από τα άγχη της δικής μας καθημερινότητας. Όμως, το ταξίδι δεν αναλώνεται μόνο στο να γνωρίσουμε τους Ταραουμάρα και να μάθουμε τα μυστικά τους, μιας και γνωρίζουμε και άλλους δρομείς και απλούς ανθρώπους που παράτησαν τις δουλειές τους και άρχισαν να ζουν για το τρέξιμο και τους αγώνες αντοχής, θέλοντας να φτάσουν το σώμα τους στα όρια. Επίσης κάνουμε και μια βόλτα από επιστημονικά εργαστήρια, μαθαίνουμε περισσότερα πράγματα για το τρέξιμο αλλά και το ίδιο μας το σώμα, μας δίνεται η δυνατότητα να καταλάβουμε γιατί το τρέξιμο είναι μέσα στο DNA μας. Στο τέλος, παρακολουθούμε με κομμένη την ανάσα τον απόλυτο αγώνα αντοχής στα φαράγγια του Μεξικού, με διάφορους τρελαμένους δρομείς να συναγωνίζονται τους χαλαρούς Ταραουμάρα.

He researchs alternatives and learns about the Tahahumara Indians who live in the remote and inaccessible copper canyon in Mexico.One of my favorite chapters was about the year a few of the Tahahumara came north to run the Ledville 100. I won't tell who won, I was in more suspense in reading that chapter than I have been watching any game on tv.But the author also talks about running in general. Thoughts like allowing long distance runners to go pro was the worst thing for American runners, it caused American marathon times to get much slower due to sponsor concerns about shoes, mileage, coaching etc..on Bill Bowerman and whether he was disillusioned at the end of the life with changes he wrought with Nike, coaching tips, the effect of expensive running shoes(the stanford cross country coach won't allow his runners to wear expensive shoes--and there's studies that back him upBut it is the author's trip to Copper Canyon that is the highlight. And the last chapters that describe the American elite ultra runners going down to Copper Canyon for a race against the Tahumura on their own turf--with no media coverage, no real prize money, no ego, well, it was great.

26,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22440207-agn,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 out of 5Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen is a captivating and inspiring journalistic quest that features a cast of memorable characters and spans human evolution, history of ultra running, and a search for a reclusive tribe of Tarahumara Indians that are known as the world's greatest distance runners.Although Christopher McDougall's writing style is entertaining, I was surprised by the lack of actual science and references. I would hope that, in addition to firsthand experience, the book is based on hours upon hours of interviews and research, but honestly, I can't be sure due to the absence of bibliography or any kind of footnotes. In fact, Born to Run reads like a book-long magazine article: catchy, dramatic, mostly anecdotal, and rather opinionated.To be honest, I found Christopher McDougall's storytelling style - the main storyline interrupted by a digression after digression - a bit annoying. By the time the side story is over, I've lost track of or interest in the original story.What is more, the author's ability to know what each character thought or felt in any given moment seems rather suspicious, especially given the lack of references. Did he actually interview all these people or simply made the details of their experiences up?Since I just finished Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of Nike, I have a better understanding and appreciation of Nike and its mission, so when Christopher McDougall starts blaming Nike for causing the running injury epidemic for the sake of profit (without much supporting evidence, might I add), I'm rather skeptical.But despite all the complaints, I enjoyed Born to Run quite a bit, especially the part about human evolution and persistence hunting. Christopher McDougall's account and his personal journey as a runner not only successfully convinced me that yes, indeed, humans were born to run, but also inspired me to go for a run myself. Thank you for that :)"

My fear is that he hurt people who could have been happily jogging along now, my hope is that he inspired someone who since have figured it out...This seems to be the kind of book to either get a ""1"" or a ""5"". I know lots of people ignore the ""hated it"" ones and therefore it is most likely that my review is going to be buried in the small pool of critics of this one. I could really not give another opinion, though; first, I lasted about 25 pages and second, they were crap. "

Não obstante, sou apologista e absoluta defensora de exercício físico; faço fitness e yoga praticamente todos os dias e adoro caminhadas na natureza, o que procuro fazer sempre que possível.O mote foi somente o passa-a-palavra e o acto que precede aquela premissa de “TENS DE LER”! Cá em casa, somos todos leitores, então, como devem calcular todos desejamos partilhar os livros que amamos, que achamos que irão proporcionar igual prazer, ou incrementar auto-estima, ou conhecimento, ou lema para a vida, etc.Na verdade o livro é muito mais do que corridas.""Abandonada no seu misterioso esconderijo nas ravinas, esta pequena tribo de eremitas tinha resolvido quase todos os problemas do Homem. Em qualquer categoria – mente, espírito ou corpo – os Tarahumaras aproximavam-se da perfeição. Era como se tivessem secretamente transformado as suas cavernas em incubadoras de prémios Nobel, todos a trabalhar para acabar com o ódio, as doenças cardíacas, as dores nas canelas e os gases de estufa.Na Terra dos Tarahumara, não havia crime, guerra nem assaltos. Não havia corrupção, obesidade, toxicodependência, ganância, violência doméstica, pedofilia, tensão arterial alta ou emissões de carbono. Não tinham diabetes, depressões, nem sequer velhice: homens de 50 anos conseguiam correr mais que adolescentes, e bisavôs de 80 anos subiam distâncias de maratona nas montanhas. Os geniais Tarahumaras tinham até chegado à economia, criando um sistema financeiro único baseado no álcool e em actos arbitrários de gentileza: em vez de dinheiro, a sua moeda de troca consistia em favores e grandes baldes de cerveja de milho.(…) E como se não bastasse ser o povo mais amável e feliz do planeta, o Tarahumara era também mais resistente: comparável à sua serenidade sobre-humana, só mesmo a sua tolerância sobre-humana à dor…"" Pág. 22Já parece que estamos a assistir ao nosso querido Indiana Jones na busca do lendário Santo Graal com o elixir da felicidade plena e jovialidade permanente.""Tinha de traçar o percurso inverso, desde o que nós nos tornámos até ao que os Tarahumaras sempre foram, e perceber onde nos tínhamos perdido. Cada filme de acção mostra o fim da civilização como uma espécie de explosão espaventosa, uma guerra nuclear ou um cometa em rota de colisão ou uma revolta de ciborgues autoconscientes, mas o verdadeiro cataclisma podia já estar a decorrer à frente dos nossos olhos: devido à avassaladora obesidade (…). Talvez os antigos hindus fossem melhor futurólogos do que Hollywood quando previram que o mundo acabaria, não numa explosão, mas num grande bocejo. Shiva, o Destruidor ia liquidar-nos com… nada.

Since elementary or let me say since the day I was born, I'm not really into running. I'm weak physically but I can do things simple and I can play table tennis, more than that, I'm like a weakling of our generation. I always ask myself, what does it feels to be running in a field or grass and flowers or in a place where orange sand, cactus and animals that spits poison can be found? Reading books was like running, it was like lifting every pages, every foot stomp on its way to the end or the finish line, waiting for something nice in the end with unexpected journey.While reading Born to Run, your journey and perspective of running will forever be change wanting to be free to all sickness and tragedy of your past. Running infinite; no tracks, no road, no turns. But to continue running horizontally in a black room with sparkling dots and shapes. Ended in a journey with life busted, wanting to do it again and again.My last running experience was when my PE teacher asked us to run in the field for 30 minutes and it was one of the worst thing happened to me. I forgot to bring something important, something I needed most of that time, water. Seriously, if my sister reminded me of bringing some I won't be in the clinic for the whole day. That was the last and the most unforgettable moment these college years. Well, I was hoping for more running experience after reading this book. Hell, if you only read the part were Christopher McDougall explains why human were born to ultra-runners.In our generation most of the time, researchers are now interested in making running as one of the most interesting sports in the world. Using our bare feet to run in the field and how far can it handle? They invented too many shoes to be enjoyed by the consumers; they are well-equipped, well-researched and well-designed for us to enjoy something while running. Not only shoes, sport's scientists also invented something that boost our body while doing exhausting works that are rich with artificial sugars at the same time dangerous and addicting. But how far can these things help us in running? Nobody knows.But when this epic runners goes in public running, underground marathon and all night drinking. This so called new generation of runners were awake of losing their foot from the hands of the tribe that I and all the readers may not know their name before and they were called the Tarahumaras. They are well described as super-athletes Indians that can be found in Mexico, invented a liquid that can boost their body capacity at the same time running without shoes. Imagine, scientists doing preliminary examinations and research for year that cost thousands that only give us limited results and sometimes failed us.This super-athletes that we are looking for are waiting for us to discover them but the most important is, are this endangered runners are worth losing in the end? Christopher Mcdougall, entrails his readers to go run for their freedom to discover things far from what been expected. Natural science is worth discovering at the same time knowing ourselves and our history for us to discover things that God given us in the beginning.

Is that a violin or a somehow related to it? I can't believe Tarahumaras wear clothes I thought they were naked and wearing short skirt. I can't believe it, I was imagining those things until I finish reading the book. The Rarámuri or Tarahumara are an indigenous people of northern Mexico who are renowned for their long-distance running ability. - Wikipedia

31,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3701960-lisa,Rating 1 out of 5,"I've heard so many great things about this book, but I wasn't a fan. If it weren't for all of the good reviews I would have stopped reading after a couple of chapters (and I'm still not sure it was worth the time to finish). Parts of the story are really interesting, but most parts are overshadowed by the author's voice. McDougall is extremely hyperbolic and overly dramatic from the beginning, which heavily damages his credibility. The best example of this might be how he spends one portion of the book going vegetarian because he believes that will make him more healthier and that it's how humans were meant to eat, and another chapter where he argues that humans were meant to be long distance runners because that's how hunters managed to kill big game until decent weapons were invented a few millenia later. Well, which is it? If we have great running skills for the purposes of eating meat on occasion, it seems that would also suggest that humans are also probably intended to actually be able to eat that meat on occasion. (Not surprisingly, this seems to conform with what we know about the average diet: most people benefit from meat but in moderation rather than the overly large quantities consumed in modern society.)The stuff on barefoot running mostly struck me as unsubstantiated here, which is a shame because there are countless numbers of good articles that support the science. McDougall's statistics on the number of runners supposedly injured every year is clearly exaggerated, and it goes without saying that some injuries (like muscle strains) have nothing to do with footwear and everything to do with other factors, like overtraining. Form is also important, but good form can be achieved regardless of footwear. If he had wanted to make a more convincing argument that runners would be better suited by using minimalist footwear, McDougall would have done better to have stuck to the facts and stop issuing pronouncements about how anyone running in stability shoes (like I do), will *definitely* be injured as a result at some point. (For the record: I've been running 10 years in stability shoes with no injuries. According to McDougall, that makes me a freak of nature--which I'd almost buy if most of my running friends weren't also wearing shoes and avoiding injury.) I'm not opposed to the minimalist movement but all he has done here is romanticize it while demonizing anyone who isn't a follower and the shoes they wear.Finally, the author's tone grated on my nerves. Besides the constant exaggeration and glossing over of facts, his language is often more vulgar than necessary and he seems shockingly condescending to many of the others profiled throughout the book. There are some orientalist issues with his portrayal of the Tarahumara (Rarámuri) and other ethnic groups whose running skills he praises, and there's a tendency for the story to jump from one topic to another, perhaps in an effort to change the topic before the reader starts asking the obvious questions about what his romanticized portrayal of these groups has left out."

It was informative, entertaining, and inspirational. Not only did it make me want to be a better runner, Born to Run left me with the feeling that it is mankind's destiny to be runners. Some bits that I want to remember:The author was getting running lessons from a mysterious ultra marathon runner in Mexico:  ""Think easy, light, smooth, and fast. You start with easy, because if that's all you get, that's not so bad. Then work on light. Make it effortless, like you don't give a **** how high the hill is or how far you've got to go. When you've practiced that so long that you forget you're practicing, you work on making it smooooooth. You won't have to worry about the last one- you get those three, and you'll be fast."" pg 111On the perfect design of the foot for running: ""Your foot's centerpiece is the arch, the greatest weight-bearing design ever created. The beauty of any arch is the way it gets stronger under stress; the harder you push down, the tighter its parts mesh. No stonemason worth his trowel would ever stick a support under an arch; push up from underneath, and you weaken the whole structure."" pg 176If you enjoyed Born to Run, you may also want to read Explorers of the Infinite: The Secret Spiritual Lives of Extreme Athletes--and What They Reveal About Near-Death Experiences, Psychic Communication, and Touching the Beyond by Maria Coffey or McDougall has a new book out called Natural Born Heroes: How a Daring Band of Misfits Mastered the Lost Secrets of Strength and Endurance which I haven't read yet, but if it's anything like this book, it's worth the read."

Θεωρώ εξαιρετικά απίθανο να διαβάσω κάτι που δε με ενδιαφέρει ΚΑΘΟΛΟΥ, όπως η ιχθυοκαλλιέργεια ξερωγώ (ή το τρέξιμο). Όμως κάποια στιγμή είχα διαβάσει κάτι πολύ ενδιαφέρον σε ένα βιβλίο: Ο συγγραφέας - που στο βιβλίο του μιλούσε για διάφορους τρόπους βελτίωσης της γραφής - ανέφερε ότι κάποτε διάβασε ένα βιβλίο με θέμα την εκτροφή πουλερικών. Δεν είχε ποτέ του ασχοληθεί με κοτόπουλα, δεν είχε ποτέ του προοπτική να ασχοληθεί με αυτά, ήταν ένα θέμα παντελώς αδιάφορο για κείνον. Κι όμως διάβασε ολόκληρο το βιβλίο, λέγοντας πως ήταν ένα από τα ενδιαφέροντα βιβλία που έχει διαβάσει.Αν το καλοσκεφτεί κανείς, μόνο όταν ένα βιβλίο καταφέρει να διαβαστεί ολόκληρο έχει εκπληρώσει το σκοπό του· ειδικά πλέον που στην εποχή μας και λόγω του διαδικτύου έχουμε πρόσβαση σε χιλιάδες βιβλία κυριολεκτικά. Ποιος ο λόγος να συνεχίσεις την ανάγνωση όταν το βιβλίο σε έχει χάσει; Εσείς που ψυχαναγκαστικά διαβάζετε ένα βιβλίο που δεν σας αρέσει μόνο και μόνο από κάποια βασανιστική λόξα το�� να μην αφήνετε δουλειές μισές - ρε σεις, όσο καλό time management και να κάνει κανείς, μόνο όταν είναι μόνος του ίσως τα φέρει βόλτα με όλα τελειωμένα. Αν έχετε συντρόφους, παιδιά, σκυλιά, γατιά, αφεντικά, αν ��εν αφήσετε και τίποτα στη μέση θα γεράσετε σαν καλοκουρδισμένα ρομποτάκια. Νοτ φαν ατ ολ - Ειλικρινά δείτε το, σπαταλάτε υπερπολύτιμο χρόνο και φαιά ουσία.Κάπως έτσι και με αυτές τις σκέψεις σε καμία περίπτωση δε θα διάβαζα βιβλίο σχετικά με το τρέξιμο. Όχι, δε θεωρώ τους δρομείς τρελούς, απλά δεν μπορώ να εντοπίσω πουθενά το παραμικρό ενδιαφέρον του να τρέχεις. Αυτό όλο κι όλο. Αν δεν ήταν το πρόσωπο στο οποίο ανήκαν τα χέρια που μου δάνεισαν το βιβλίο λέγοντάς μου ότι έχει ΠΑΡΑ ΠΟΛΥ ΕΝΔΙΑΦΕΡΟΝ, θα αγνοούσα την ύπαρξή του ή κι αν κάποτε τη γνώριζα δε θα το πλησίαζα. Τρέξιμο επί 300 σελίδες. Who cares?Κι όμως, αυτή η θεότρελη περιπέτεια ξεκίνησε από την πιο απλή ερώτηση: Γιατί πονάει το πόδι μου;Ο ΜακΝτούγκαλ, αρθρογράφος, συγγραφέας και δρομέας ο ίδιος, μια μέρα το 2001 πήγε στο γιατρό του υποφέροντας από τον πόνο. Ο γιατρός του συνέστησε (και ακόμα δύο γιατροί μετά) να βρει άλλο χόμπι. Ναι, αλλά γιατί πονάει το πόδι μου; Γιατί το τρέξιμο σου κάνει κακό, είπε ο γιατρός. Ναι, αλλά γιατί; Γιατί κάνει το πόδι σου να πονάει. Αλλά αυτή η απάντηση δεν του ήταν αρκετή. Και κάπως έτσι και με κάτι ακόμα προέκυψε το Born to Run.Σε τσακώνει από την πρώτη κιόλας σελίδα του, ενώ από κάποιο σημείο κι έπειτα, η ανάγνωση μοιάζει και η ίδια με κούρσα. Σχεδόν ανά πρόταση έπρεπε να γκουγκλάρω, όχι τόσο για να διασταυρώσω τις πληροφορίες, η αφήγηση είναι τόσο άμεση, γρήγορη και θεαματική που δε σε ενδιαφέρει πια πού σταματάει η αλήθεια και πού αρχίζει η υπερβολή, αλλά για να μπω στο youtube και να δω όλα αυτά τα τιτανοτεράστια ονόματα του χώρου στην πράξη. Τον Σκοτ Τζούρεκ, που μεγάλωσε ως ο τελευταίος της παρέας και με το παρατσούκλι Μαλάκας, το κλωτσοσκούφι του σχολείου, ο πιο τελειωμένος κι αποτυχημένος αθλητής, που έγινε κορυφαίος υπερμαραθωνοδρόμος. Τον Εμίλ Ζάτοπεκ, με το παρατσούκλι ατμομηχανή, που έτρεχε κι είχε μια έκφραση λες και ήταν έτοιμος να σωριαστεί νεκρός, που έλεγε γελώντας ότι δεν έχει τόσο ταλέντο ώστε να μπορεί να τρέχει και να χαμογελάει ταυτόχρονα, που έκανε ένα ακόντιο κοντάρι για σκούπα και το έδωσε στη γυναίκα του, που εξαιτίας πολιτικών εξελίξεων ο πλανήτης στερήθηκε τον μεγαλύτερο ίσως δρομέα όλων των εποχών, ο μόνος άνθρωπος στον κόσμο που μετά από 70 χιλιόμετρα ασταμάτητης πορείας είχε αρκετή όρεξη για κουβέντα και οι δρομείς τον απέφευγαν επειδή μιλούσε πολύ την ώρα του αγώνα! Την Ανν Τρέιζον, μια κοντούλα αδυνατούλα που βαριόταν να τρέχει και ήθελε να ανοίξει ζαχαροπλαστείο, με την πιο αδιάφορη εμφάνιση στον κόσμο ολόκληρο και η οποία έγινε η πρώτη γυναίκα υπερμαραθωνοδρόμος που έτρεξε 100 μίλια. Την Κοιλάδα του Θανάτου με τους 56 βαθμούς, όπου οι δρομείς τρέχουν πάνω στην άσπρη γραμμή γιατί αλλιώς λιώνουν οι σόλες τους, όπου πριν προλάβεις να διψάσεις πεθαίνεις, τα «μουλάρια», δηλαδή τους συνοδούς όλων αυτών των απίστευτων ανθρώπων που έτρεχαν μαζί τους κουβαλώντας εξοπλισμό, φακό, νερό, τζελ υδατανθράκων, που έτρεχαν τα ίδια ακριβώς χιλιόμετρα μόνο για να στηρίξουν τους δρομείς τους, και φυσικά τους ίδιους τους Ταραουμάρα, με τα σανδάλια τους από λάστιχο κι ένα μονό κορδόνι που θέλει τέχνη για να δέσεις, και τον Καμπάγιο Μπλάνκο, το λευκό άλογο, τον πρώην παλαιστή που περπάτησε ως τους Ταραουμάρα στη μέση του πουθενά, που σταμάτησε να τρέχει γιατί συνεχώς τραυματιζόταν, και που μια δεκαετία αργότερα σε κείνη τη γη, δε σταμάτησε να τρέχει ποτέ, και που ακόμα και οι Ταραουμάρα θεωρούσαν λιγάκι …τρελό.Και πόσα, πόσα πράγματα ακόμα! Θα μπορούσα να γράφω σελίδες μέχρι αύριο. Αυτό δεν ήταν βιβλίο, τελικά. Είναι κυριολεκτικά ένα έπος για το πιο αρχέγονο ένστικτο του ανθρώπου: Της φυγής, της αναζήτησης, της επιβίωσης, της ελευθερίας, μέσα σε κάτι λιγότερο από 300 σελίδες. Και το καλύτερο θα μας έρθει με την ταινία, όπου πρωταγωνιστής θα είναι ο αγαπημένος μου Μάθιου Μακόναχι (μετράω μέρες, έτσι;)Από ό,τι είδα κάποιοι του αθλήματος εντόπισαν αντιφάσεις και υπερβολές στο βιβλίο. Αναγνωστικά και μόνο, δε με ένοιαξε στιγμή. Από την άλλη βέβαια, είναι επικίνδυνες οι λάθος επιρροές. Πολλοί δρομείς υιοθέτησαν το μινιμαλιστικό στυλ των Ταραουμάρα, απορρίπτοντας τα παπούτσια, τρέχοντας με κάτι που έμοιαζε περισσότερο με λαστιχένια κάλτσα, όμως ο σύγχρονος άνθρωπος δεν έχει τίποτα κοινό με τους Ταρ��ουμάρα για να μπορεί να τρέξει έτσι και σαφώς μετά από πολλούς τραυματισμούς ξαναφορέσανε τα πανάκριβα παπούτσια τους.Να πούμε και τα της έκδοσης: Γενικά μου αρέσουν τα βιβλία της Key Books. Όσα έχω είναι πολύ προσεγμένα αισθητικά και το γενικότερο περιεχόμενό τους πάντα ενδιαφέρον (όπως το μικρούλι Έξω απ’ τα δόντια του Lois και το Άγρια της Strayed). Κι εδώ παραλίγο να πω τα ίδια, αλλά δεν τα λέω γιατί εντόπισα ένα δυο mistypes, και δε θα το ανέφερα καν, αν δεν εντόπιζα άλλα δυο τρία από τη μέση και πέρα, και αν το ένα από αυτά δεν ήταν στο οπισθόφυλλο - απαράδεκτο να υπάρχει λάθος στο οπισθόφυλλο ενός βιβλίου ρε παίδες.Αν δεν αγαπάς το τρέξιμο, προφανώς το βιβλίο δε θα σου γεννήσει καμιά τρελή επιθυμία να ξεχυθείς στους δρόμους με σκοπό να προπονηθείς για να γίνεις ο επόμενος υπερμαραθωνοδρόμος. Αλλά σίγουρα θα σε κάνει να φορέσεις τα αθλητικά σου και να βγεις έστω μέχρι το κοντινό σου πάρκο. Στις 6 το πρωί. Μόνος. Για ένα γύρο. Κι ίσως τελικά σ’ αρέσει.Έχω διαβάσει πολλά ωραία βιβλία ρε παιδιά. Πολλά και υπέροχα βιβλία. Αλλά αυτό ήταν το πιο αδιανόητα τρελό κι απίθανο βιβλίο που έχω διαβάσει ποτέ μου."
35,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2447803-jason,Rating 4 out of 5,"Born to Run is one of the most compelling books I've read in the last few years. And without a doubt, chapter 28 is THE most compelling 30 pages of non-fiction I've read in 8 years.I'm not a runner. But reading this book dumped the same endorphins into my veins that marathoners get at mile 24, leaving me with a runner's 'high.' It also left me with a nasty distaste of athletic shoe companies for wielding the biggest scam in the market bonanza of athletic shoe sales since Nike glued rubber and foam to canvas.McDougall's absolute bottom line thesis is that running has become worse over the years. This, despite technological advances to enhance the science of long distance running (studies about form, ergometrics, anatomy, physiology, diet, gear, psyche, and training for altitude, endurance, speed, pace and incline). Injuries have increased. Speed has decreased. Form has worsened. Pleasure has declined. Running has become more and more foreign to how our bodies actually want to move along the ground.The author illustrates his thesis from several angles. He plows into scientific data. He introduces some of the most eccentric, yet successful ultra-distance runners in America. He describes the sudden, recent spike in global ultra marathons. He digs into the most recent--and most explosive--anthropological data. He reveals evolutionary trends. He explains how different cultures think about distance running. He ruminates about his own long discouraging experience with running. He uncovers stories from the past about runners and their techniques. Ultimately though, he underscores the entire book with his exploration of the mythic aura about a Native American Indian tribe called the Tarahumara whose members easily run hundreds of miles at a time in the Copper Canyons of central Mexico.A special shout-out to Chapter 28. Why and how did homo sapiens evolve away from chimpanzees and bypass Australopithecus and Neanderthals to exist on earth as the prolific human plague we are today? Early homo sapiens, with their weak, slender, hairless body frames couldn't compete with the strength of chimps and apes. They couldn't compete with the weathered compactness of Neanderthals and Cro-Magnon Man. They weren't fast enough to hunt, and not yet smart enough for tools. They couldn't cultivate, couldn't farm. They were not omnivores; they definitely needed animal protein. What was our advantage 2 million years ago against our potential prey? What? What was the advantage, beginning eons ago, that carried forward until about 1970 when Nike starting making--specifically--running shoes?***SPOILER ALERT***It was our freakin' endurance, man. We're the only mammal on earth whose respiration is not anatomically locked into a 1:1 ratio with our stride. We have stamina that lasts 40-60 miles, and there isn't an animal in Africa that can outlast a sprawling cordon of homo sapiens running like a curtain across the Serengeti. Humans can outrun any horse on the planet in 50 miles. As a tribe, homo sapiens can certainly outlast a gazelle, a cape water buffalo, a zebra, a dik-dik, a wildebeest. It may take 16 hours and end up on another watershed area, but that tribe will most definitely eat meat tonight. Simply cut a herd animal out of the pack, and run it into the ground. Man hits his running peak at age 27. But he's physiologically equal at age 19 and 61, so there's a long taper off period after man hits his peak. Man; woman; child; old or young; the tribe would set off after the runners, eventually meeting the kill and regrouping until the meat was gone. I'll be damn, huh?***END SPOILER ALERT*** Most primitive people around the world today run long distances barefooted, with less running injuries than suburban American richies. The human foot is an anatomical arch, and the angles at the ankle, knee and hip act as perfect dampeners to a mid-foot strike. Nike has added the gel, absorbers, padding and the arch support to encourage a heel-strike: viola...plantar fascitits, heel spurs, restricted pronation and supination, shin splints, and torn achilles tendon. Comfortable shoes--my God, man!--have turned us into runners with perverted form, causing inevitable problems with our lower backs, and hamstrings, and toenails, and knee and hip inflammation.  The Tarahumara Indians have never purposely trained for ultra marathons, yet in 1986 they were yanked out of obscurity by a running promoter and beat all the world's best athletes at the Leadville 100-Miler, run exclulsively at 9,000-12,000 feet in altitude. They ran in sandles. They returned to obscurity and never came back. Why? Read the book. A bit about the writing. Christopher McDougall writes like Jon Krakauer. He doesn't overload the science. There's a human story here, and he purposefully stays away from being too academic. There's also momentum in the story, and a bit of mystery the reader must unravel. Overall, though, I could only award 4-stars because I think he avoided hard science to the book's detriment. I'm as much a non-fiction reader as a fiction reader, and this book screams out to be more heavily laden with pure science. There were no pictures, graphs, industry numbers, personal interviews, footnotes to academic works, or anatomical plates in a story that certainly warranted more than the written word. In the end Born to Run left me just short of a sui generis work of revealing, compelling science."

The author tells he story of the Tarahumara, but it’s really more about ultrarunning and the kinds of characters it attracts. It’s also highly motivational - it makes you want to drink chia and buy some minimalist running sandals."
37,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Born To Run is a fascinating book. As always, I love books where the author presents new information in an engaging fashion!! The interwoven themes include:1) The history of Ultra-Marathons and the Ultra-Runners who compete in them. Ultra-Marathons are any races longer than a regular marathon (just over 26 miles). Most of them are 50km, 100km, 50 miles, or 100 miles (although they can be much longer). The marathoners themselves are...insane—I mean, incredible, athletes. There's Ann, for example, a short, slender, community college teacher, who was the female champion of the Western States 100 FOURTEEN TIMES, and during one fun four year stretch, she ran an ultramarathon every other month. Yet she seemed to get stronger and faster the more she ran. Why doesn't she get injuries, like most runners do?2) The Tarahumara Indians from Mexico have this inexplicable ability to run hundreds of miles without becoming exhausted, and to do it constantly without any running injuries. Oh, and while barefoot or wearing homemade sandals, not fancy running shoes. 3) Why do all (normal) runners have such a huge percentage of running related injuries? Roughly 8 out of 10 runners are injured EVERY YEAR! Injuries are increasing, marathon times are not. What the heck are we doing wrong??4) The Leadville Trail 100, which is one of the scariest races imaginable. It's the highest altitude city in North America, and one of the coldest. So it's perfect for a 100 mile race. Especially when the starting line is twice as high as the altitude where airplanes pressurize their cabins, and it only goes up from there.5) Are humans designed to run without shoes, and is all our technology and sophisticated gear making things worse? Is there biological and evolutionary evidence that we were originally engineered to run? Or is that completely wrong?There are multiple ultra-marathoners and multiple (horrifying sounding) ultra races compared in here. The evolution stuff was especially interesting. The entire book was really fascinating—since I find running in general to be downright boring! So if I find a book about running to be THIS entertaining, then the author did a great job!!Recommend to anyone who runs, or anyone who is a fan of learning interesting random things (like me)!!"
38,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29075798-adam,Rating 5 out of 5,"Review of the audiobook narrated by Fred Sanders.Running has been a constant and positive part of my life for more than 10 years now, so much so that I'm surprised I've never actually read a book about running. This book is for anyone truly serious about running or interested in the science of running. We are given a brief history of ultra running and the genesis of the running shoe industry along with an anthropological analysis of why humans are genetically inclined to run long distances. I was fascinated throughout, especially with the science aspects.I did some adventure racing in the late 2000's, with races being 6 hours, 12 hours and even one 24 hour race. It was more of a team fun thing (3 of us kayaking, mountain biking, trail running and orienteering) and not a push your body to the limit race like an ultra. It definitely gives me an appreciation of long distance runners and the work that they put into it, but I also think you have to be a little crazy to run an ultra-length race. This book does glorify the long distance aspect of running, where if you can't understand or appreciate why someone would want to run marathon distance (or longer) races it may take away from your enjoyment of the book.The anthropological evidence put forth in the book is extremely compelling. While I really liked the entire book, that was definitely my favorite part of the book. I can't say I was 100% convinced as there is so much we cannot know about our prehistoric ancestors, but it definitely gave me a lot to think about.Fred Sanders does a great job with the narration. There was much more dialog in this book than other nonfiction books I've listened to and he was consistently good throughout - definitely with his Spanish pronunciation.Final verdict: 5 star story, 4.5 star narration, 5 stars overall"

If you hate thinking about running and despise people who run. You need to read this book. What if I told you that elite athletes can run for 100 miles at a time? How about the fact that an average runner could beat an average horse in a distance race. Not only that they can, but they do, every year. Or that a human being is so effectively constructed for long distance running, that it is possible for a human hunter to  literally run down an antelope, exhausting his prey,and outlasting it. While most animals are faster than humans in quick bursts, few if any can out run us for the long haul. Intrigued yet? This book has everything going for it. Dangerous drug mafiosos. Serious journalism. A mystery tribe from Mexico. And a cast of characters that looks like it was drawn for the Wacky Racers cartoon show. I run, but I don't consider myself a serious runner. I loved everything about this book from McDoughal's tasty prose to his self-depreciating humor. It's been a long time since I've walked away from a book learning as much genuinely new information as I have here. Some of the material is already a little dated, (the Five Finger Shoe guys have come under some scrutiny recently for instance among other things) but none of these even slightly deterrs from the overall punch of the book. Go buy this book. Borrow it from a library. Steal it from the rotting shell of a bombed out Barnes & Nobel Bookstore. I don't care. Just read it. Then go run. http://joshuarigsby.com"

By the end of it I was so inspired about running that I wanted to just go and run 50 miles right out the gate. I'm not even kidding (however, I thought better of that and decided to stick to my 3-mile jaunts). So, way to be super inspiring, Born to Run!As a story, the book gets a nine. If this book had been billed as a novel it would have gotten really high marks. I was totally engaged in the characters, rooting for every one, loving the drama. I thought the story background chapters were well mixed into the story-propelling chapters. And the writing was clear, well paced, and fun.However, this book doesn't bill itself as a novel, it bills itself as non-fiction, and it kind of sucks at that. Like I can only give it a two, and only that high because McDougall is a journalist, and so I forgive him for not sourcing primary material like interviews and first-hand accounts. Unfortunately, there's a LOT of material in the book that isn't primary material and there were too many times when McDougall would claim something, and I would respond ""Says who?"" or ""according to what?"" The lack of sourcing and notes made me question the validity of many of his claims. Seriously, all I would have needed was a footnote, but there were none and so I'm concerned the foundation of the book is based on shoddy research or word of mouth.So, sorry Chris, I couldn't give your book a higher score because you tried to claim it was non-fiction, but then I couldn't prove that.

42,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/236411-steve,Rating 4 out of 5,"This reminded me of one of those great human interest stories you might have stumbled upon in Sports Illustrated back in its heyday. The personalities were interesting, the pace was good, and the fact that it’s a fringe sport made it all the more fascinating. Hundred mile ultras at altitude are bound to attract an odd cast of characters. To the preternaturally persistent nut cases on the US side add a remote tribe of corn beer-quaffing, peace-loving, super runners from the Copper Canyons of Mexico and you’ve got the makings of a tasty ragout. And McDougall sold it well. He may have over-emphasized whole sub-cult of shoelessness, though he was great at setting the stage for the big race at the end. It seemed like he ran out of steam as he recounted the long journey through the canyons, but the lead-up was told in such a crisp and colorful way that all is forgiven. Besides, McDougall was one of the runners himself, so he had an excuse for the narrative bonk."
43,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51069187-marie,Rating 4 out of 5,"“You don’t stop running because you get old, you get old because you stop running”This book is an insightful, fascinating and inspirational look into the world of long distance running. There is a group of people, known as the Tarahumara, who live in the cliff sides of Copper Canyon in Mexico. This is a lawless area where Tarahumara enjoy relative isolation. The only other people who spend time in this area are the drug lords. The Tarahumara run long distances as part of their culture and tradition. They are a peaceful people who enjoy longevity and a life without crime or mental illness. They are mistrusting of the outside world, as in the past they have been exploited, enslaved and even decapitated. They eat a diet composed mostly of corn and corn beer. This novel seeks to understand the world of ultra marathoners, both of those who run as part of their culture in the case of the Tarahumara and those who are drawn to it despite their culture.I always felt that running great distances was a detriment to one’s health, that running should be done in moderation so as not to wear out one’s body. However, this book changed my thinking. The feats that the runners in this book were capable of was awe inspiring. This book makes the reader believe and understand that we were made to run, we should run and furthermore, that running should be enjoyable.A group of researchers back in the 1980s came to the realization that human beings were not evolved to be walkers like their closest relative, the chimpanzee. Human beings were evolved to be runners, to track their prey over long distances. This is why humans have nuchal ligaments, achilles tendons, an amazing foot structure, a stride greater than a horse’s, and a pattern of respiration that is not fixed to their stride. The injuries we see now from running did not exist prior to the advent of the modern running shoe. With the modern running shoe, feet become weaker. With the modern running shoe, pain signals are not sent to the brain to indicate improper form. Thus, poor form and injuries result. The modern day running shoe has led to an increase in heart disease, knee replacements, and more sedentary lifestyles. If we trained and ran more like our ancestors we would be much healthier and happier.Listening to this audio book, I was enthralled by the stories, especially of the races. Who knew that telling of an account of a 100 mile race could be so riveting and exciting? Not I. At least, not until I listened to the tales of the races in this book, including Leadville races and the ultimate race in Copper Canyons. This is one sport where women can excel and often prevail over the men. Consider this statistic: 90% of females finish ultra marathons, while only 50% of the men do. There is great psychology involved in these races according to the author. The racers often think of themselves as hunter or prey in order to motivate themselves. In the case of the Tarahumara, there is the joy of sharing a tradition, running together as a people. It is “character” that the author concludes makes a truly great runner. Scott Jurek was able to find his tribe wherever he went, transcending cultures and communities, always demonstrating tremendous character.There was were amazing pearls of advice streaming throughout this novel. I was mentally storing those I thought would be important for myself and will share some of them here. Stretching leads to more injuries. It is best to skip it. The more cushioned the sneakers, the more likely they will lead to injury. If you are running in a cushioned sneaker, try to add in some barefoot runs in dewy grass. If you start running long distances, diet should come about naturally to aid the running lifestyle. A nutrient rich vegan diet is best for a leaner, healthier body. In the beginning, especially if you are looking to take off some weight, you should run below the aerobic threshold, in the fat-burning zone. Building up endurance in this zone will make you stronger on longer runs. The best form when running is to run with a short stride and quick foot turnover. You should feel as if you have a rope tied around your middle and you are pulling something heavy. Being a good person, it seems makes you a better runner. Improving personal relationships and practicing abundance by giving back are pieces of advice given by running coaches. Vigil, a long time running coach, also advises “ask nothing from your running and you’ll get more than you ever imagined.”The Tarahumara, a culture of the greatest runners on earth share the following core virtues: patience, strength, dedication, persistence and cooperation. Other great runners seem to share these same characteristics, bringing them together in a beautiful community. The Tarahumara is perhaps the last remaining culture on earth that still incorporates long distance running into their life and culture. They reap the benefits in health, community and joyfulness. As scientists have discovered, we were evolved to be runners. As Dr. Bramble puts it, “Just move your legs. Because if you don’t think you were born to run, you’re not only denying history. You’re denying who you are.”This book convinced me that “running is our superpower, entrenched in the human imagination.” I have already started to run more because of this book. I am trying not to be obsessed with heart rate and pace, but to enjoy the meditative aspects of it more. I highly recommend this book to everyone who runs or is even thinking about running."

However, the derails are always interesting material, and almost always tie back into the overarching story really well in the end. "
45,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6401606-goldgato,Rating 4 out of 5,"Running for the masses came to the forefront in the 1970s, when everything else in the world seemed to be going awry. Fuel shortages, terrorism, corrupt leaders, inflation, high unemployment, spiraling crime rates…the world just sucked. So when the Average Joe decided to start running (Forrest Gump style), an entire industry of trainers/sneakers was born (say hello, Nike). Soon there were weekly races and marathons became overwhelmed with weekend runners who trained hard to justify their new obsession. With the new runners came a new problem and that was foot pain. Suddenly there were podiatrists on every street corner and still the corns and the blisters and the Plantar Fasciitis continued. The injuries continued into the 1980s and the 1990s, when running as a hobby peaked. As Spike Lee would say, “It’s gotta be the shoes”.Christopher McDougall was one of those intrepid runners who discovered as he aged that his feet became more and more painful. Most amateur runners moved on to other endeavours, but McDougall loved running and soon found himself searching for the answer to solve the pain. This led him to discover that increasingly expensive running shoes, which supposedly conferred faster times and better cushioning, were the problem. Humans may prefer to run and walk with some good foam beneath them, but it really doesn’t help our feet. They need to feel the ground. And so this book was born.There’s more than just a journey to alleviate pain. The author learned about the Tarahumara Indians of Mexico, who run on bare, or close to bare, feet and can run down game after several hours of blissful jogging. Before he knew it, McDougall was on his way to a new way of movement while also participating in a contest full of some of the greatest runners in the world. As a former runner who used to pound out 80 miles a week, I really enjoyed this book. The writing is excellent and the flow acts to bring all the disparate events together. It was also a reminder of how easily we adapt to new technology (say hello, Nike) without thinking about what we are giving up in the process. I managed to stay away from some of the worse runner’s pain because part of my routine involved running to work via the beach, where I ran barefoot in the surf. I can attest to the different way my feet felt when unshod versus fully enveloped in high-tech trainers.This is one of those non-fiction books which can be enjoyed by any reader, even those with a cozy couch and streaming apps. It just might get you off that couch and into a world of walking/running for your health.Book Season = Summer (savage terrains)"

And man! these people are seriously hardcore. They go on 100-mile races in the desert (where their shoes sometimes melt off), in the mountains (where the air is thin), on up and down rocky tracks, at night, while breastfeeding, while being barefoot, while racing against horses, you name it. And a lot of the athletes setting the records are over 40, some even over 60 years old. It's a whole new world.  I never realised it existed. Granted, some of these people sounded somewhat crazy, tbh, but fascinating nonetheless.Towards the end of the book, the author got into the anthropological account of running in the history of human species and how human running is different from the way animals run and the consequences of such differences. I'm into this stuff. The theories and facts and research he mentioned were really cool.The author mentioned some helpful tips and things to look out for (as in - the way to pick out running shoes, the correct way to put your feet down while running) which I think were great and useful.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKEWhile I felt like the research was cool, my hands itched to double-check the science behind this, because somehow the book felt self-congratulatory and biased sometimes. At least the author was upfront about the fact that the scientist conducting the research was a hardcore marathoner himself. No wonder he spent decades trying to prove running was an integral part of Homo Sapiens becoming the dominant species on Earth. Sometimes things written in this book felt too crazy and/or biased and made trust the author less.A very large portion of this book felt like reading sports commentary. You know, just a loooong, very detailed account of one race and then another race. Jim was in the lead, then Ben got ahead, the Jim caught up with him and they ran side by side for a mile, etc.etc. It was boring to me. I never watch any kind of sports matches/races, but reading them like this has even less of an appeal. Maybe running fans would find it interesting? In any case, the book was pretty good. It made me go on a run with my husband even. Although running is too generous of a word for what I did:"
47,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37640114-emma-scott,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book is so much more than a story about a race. It’s spiritual, heartwarming, with a vein of human compassion running straight through it and that is the real plot of the book. I think too often we are told we have limitations and, even more often than that, we believe them. Knowing that we are stronger and more resilient than the thoughts in our head tell us we are (or that society lures is into believing) is the first step towards health. Reading this book is a good place to start changing that mental negativity and rediscovering our own power, along with the lesson that power does not mean conquer. Compassion and kindness and taking care of our bodies are the ancient, forgotten keys to happiness. Simple as that.And it’s entertaining as hell to boot. 😊"

It reads like McDougall is trying to sell the idea of distance running as a macho endeavor to red-blooded NFL fans or monster truck enthusiasts. There was one particular moment when I said out loud to no one, ""Nope! Can't do it! We're done here,"" and gave up. It was when he described one particular ""tough guy"" ultrarunner whose team included a ""beautiful endurance sports specialist who not only monitored his calories, but hoisted her top and flashed her breasts whenever she felt [he] needed perking up."""

Maybe I get to go to the Copper Canyon someday and pay my respects to them. Having said that, some of these jaw dropping runner stories don’t sound very real. Maybe McDougall’s over the top hyperbole or sometimes his absurd statistics, he sounds like an old uncle telling funny hunting stories rather than an investigative journalist. If you could manage to unsee that, the book runs like the wind. It is a really fun read. "

But it also got raves from some people, and it's a phenomenon, and I have Audible credits to burn, so I ""read"" it.The narrative bits are entertaining. When he as a series of events that he witnessed to recount, McDougall is a second-rate Krakauer and it works just fine. I burned through all 11 hours of the book in a work week, because the stories are compelling. Whenever McDougall has ""ideas"" to talk about, the book is really bad. Chapter Two stands out as fascinatingly bad. Here is a chunk that I found quoted approvingly several times on the internet: Three times, America has seen distance-running skyrocket, and it’s always in the midst of a national crisis. The first boom came during the Great Depression, when more than two hundred runners set the trend by racing forty miles a day across the country in the Great American Footrace. Running then went dormant, only to catch fire again in the early ’70s, when we were struggling to recover from Vietnam, the Cold War, race riots, a criminal president, and the murders of three beloved leaders. And the third distance boom? One year after the September 11 attacks, trail-running suddenly became the fastest-growing outdoor sport in the country. This drove me crazy while I was hearing it. It's so bad that it would embarrass even Malcolm Gladwell. (zing! lolz.) First of all, there's no clear notion of what it means for distance running to skyrocket, how that was measured or how it was decided that these were the times it had occurred. ""Trail running is growing"" and ""some people ran across the country"" seem like arbitrary selections; what about ""marathon entrance per capita"" or something as a measure? Secondly, it seems like these ""crises"" were cherry-picked to fit these weird ""booms."" Why wasn't running popular *during* the Vietnam War, or WWII even? Were the 70s really so bad, or is that just a hodgepodge of unrelated cultural misfortunes? What's really frustrating about this is that it's wholly unnecessary. You could have this whole book without this shitty paragraph and none of the impact or meaning would be lost. It's a throwaway, but because it's so awful it undermines McDougall's credibility as a person who can form or evaluate ideas, reformulate them for consumption, and present them to you. You add to this a weird mix of magical thinking (""the wisest people on earth"") and creepy racism (""the men of this culture wouldn't have sex with their wives if not for alcohol"") concerning the Tarahumara and whole swaths of this book are just not good. The barefoot running proselytization is also somewhat wearying, even though I sort of buy parts of it and already run in ""minimalist"" shoes. The ""evolved to run"" parts are probably the best-handled ""ideas"" in the book, and even that part isn't nearly as conclusive as McDougall would like it to seem. Nonetheless, I can't go lower than three stars because I was engrossed and mostly entertained. "

O livro é escrito com algum humor e, na última parte do livro (durante a tal Ultramaratona Caballo Branco), era só isto que me vinha à cabeça:Aprendi bastante sobre a história das corridas (<3 Emil Zátopek) e, no geral, é um livro interessante, mas confesso que esperava mais informação sobre os tarahumaras."
53,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/738118-annie,Rating 3 out of 5,"I have reached a point in my life where I can say that I actually like running. Some days, I even LOVE it. This book is filled with colorful characters, races, and topics surrounding this activity. A journalist begins running and is plagued with some running injuries. After being told by two sports medicine doctors that his best option would be to quit, Christopher McDougall stubbornly chooses another path. He tries to find the Tarahumura, a super-secret hidden tribe in the Copper Canyons of Mexico, who are so skilled at running they sometimes run for three days straight just for fun. The Tarahumara also don't wear anything close to resembling our modern day technological running shoes. Yet, the incidence of running injuries is incredibly low. As McDougall discovers there are a few people who run like the Tarahumara run in the US. Soon, with the help of Caballo Blanco, a white man living among the Tarahumara, the author finds himself involved in one of the most intense races between the ultra runners of the world on an incredibly difficult course. The book had a lot of interesting information. McDougall makes a case for barefoot running and argues that the modern shoe causes a lot of problems for runners. I liked reading about the different races and couldn't believe how intense some of them were. Guess I can't really complain about running 3 miles when people run 100 miles in the Death Valley heat. Amazing. I didn't like how unorganized the book was. I felt the author jumped around so much, introduced some pointless characters and delved into side topics (like arguing we evolved into the humans we are and survived because of running) that took away from the thrill of the story and just made it a choppy read. Overall, though, it was interesting and I spent time looking stuff up on the internet because of the book. Anytime a desire is created for more information by a book's topic, I'd say it was a good read. Who knows-I might even try out barefoot running up and down my driveway. "

""If you don't have answers to your problems after a four-hour run, you ain't getting them.""
 I've never given much thought to ultra-runners, but when I did, I felt alienated. Running fifty to a hundred miles sounds other-earthly to me. But then curiosity got the best of me, and so I picked up Born to Run, not knowing that it would feed me with a whole new surge of love for running.Born to Run is a tribute to the Tarahumara, a Mexican tribe living quietly and secluded in the canyons, while also being the best ultra-runners the world has ever seen. Wearing togas, dresses and bare sandals, they can go for miles and miles. Christopher McDougall tells their story with passion and curiosity and his style of writing is both informative and entertaining. On his own quest to becoming a better runner, his journey is relatable and I enjoyed the way the story was told in real-time. His search for answers about why he kept getting injured, while the Tarahumara seemed invincible lead him to research suggesting that we've become the humans we have due to our ability to run and that hi-tech running shoes might do more harm than good, considering our feet are designed perfectly for just that. 
""There's something so universal about that sensation, the way running unites our two most primal impulses: fear and pleasures. We run when we're scared, we run when we're ecstatic, we run away from our problems and run around for a good time.""
All in all, it's an entertaining, informative and inspiring read. I feel like going for a run now!"

I guess the big thing about this book is that it doesn't matter if you run or not--it's still fascinating. I mean, especially if you don't run, you probably never hear of the Leadville 100, a 100-mile race through the mountains in Colorado. It's interesting to know about it, but then you add the characters that participate in it. It's a scream. Literally.I missed my subway stops on Chapter 28, which is about the evolutionary science behind long distance running and why some animals do better than others. Now, you may think, how interesting can this be? Try it and see for yourself. The part about training in the Kalahari with the Bushmen had me enthralled. I am not a runner, but I wish I was after this. In fact, I may just try it again, especially after knowing I don't have to be able to afford those expensive shoes. I do think there are some among us that are 'built' for running and the rest of us may be built for some other kind of sport, but there usually running can be incorporated into the cross training. The final race is a vision: 100 degrees in the shade, 6000 foot peaks, the Tarahumara with their white, embroidered skirts, the ""pretty little witch"", big-mouth Ted with his green, toed socks, and a Mexican town dressed to party...it's engrossing.

Even though I have been a runner my whole life and some of the insights about the mid-foot strike were not new to me, there were a ton of interesting stories of researchers that worked and discovered how we were literally born to run.Right after I was done with the book I went running barefoot for 1 hour and almost injured myself. After a couple years though I built tolerance to it and now most of my slow recovery runs are with minimalistic shoes to remind myself how our body is meant to be used!December 2nd I am running the North Face 50K trail run :-)"

The first time was pretty much around the whole barefoot and trail running hype. Doing it now that the hype has settled a bit, you look at things slightly different.There is a bit of story, a bit of competition, a bit of perseverance and some history (whether accurate or not).I did like the South African references to the Comrades, runners, and the Kalahari bushmen.The story jumps around a bit, but you seem to get into where they are again quite easily.Please don't start Ultra Trail running without shoes at the back of this book.

Feels like I have consumed enough media throughout the years on the lore of trail running for this to be an exciting read. McDougall seems like an average runner with a huge appetite for learning. This sort of book read directly like one large article, which is credit to the author who himself has a magazine background. The story itself is wildly entertaining, culminating on the final two chapters that my heartbeat raced to finish (no pun intended). While sometimes the science behind the running dragged, I enjoyed how throughout the story McDougall would catch readers up to speed with the specific nuances of how we learn and study running. I'll be studying up on the strategies of running mentioned by our forefathers for my personal gain soon."

65,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33738834-peter,Rating 1 out of 5,"Before I start ranting about why exactly this book is so bad, I want to point out that I'm aware that most, if not all, non-fiction book authors have some sort of agenda or point they want to convey. I always take any book that makes sweeping statements on what's best for you with a huge pinch of salt and I think everyone should as well. Being sceptical, especially in this internet age where anyone can create believable content, is my primary attitude when reading these kinds of books and if anything sounds too good to be true, with some basic research, you'll usually find that it is.[Warning. Ranting from here on]Stupidity might annoy me, but bad science infuriates me. In a time where there are still people who think the Earth is flat, it's really not that hard to convince most about dubious hypotheses by simply using a plausible narrative and some manipulative writing. The secret is to sprinkle actual facts in often enough to keep people hooked on to whatever conspiracy you're trying to cram down their throats. I was lucky in that many of the topics brought up in this book were ones I've had an interest in for a long time which meant that I could spot the outright bullshit more often than not. The main source of the bullshit in most cases are not the actual claims, but the way they're presented as fact when there is still a lot of scientific debate about their accuracy.Let's go into some examples. The author would have you believe that running shoes are not only inferior to barefoot running, but actively causing running injuries as well. You don't even need to do research to realise this is blatantly false. Without even going into how most elite runners do, in fact, wear shoes, simply extracting data from the book should tell you all you need to know. One person went barefoot, the running tribe people wore hard tyre rubber to protect their feet, while the best modern runners all wore modern running shoes. If those running shoes were less efficient and caused injuries then why did all those runners seem completely fine, both during the tough races and in their overall careers where some did insane feats like multiple ultras within short periods of time?Nutrition and diet are incredibly complex topics and if anyone tells you that a certain diet is the best one, you can easily dismiss them by pointing to thousands of studies that show dozens of completely different diets that have equal or even better health benefits. I'm not saying the diet proposed by the author here is bad for you, it's just that it's definitely not as great as he makes it out to be, especially when factors such as sustainability and balanced nutrition are concerned.There were a couple more highly dubious claims in this book, but I'll only touch on one more that I found particularly ridiculous. The author stated that the reason for the extinction of Neanderthals was that despite their superior strength and intellect, they died out because they couldn't run down their prey like humans could. This is just stupid on a logical level and while it might have been a factor, research points to many other, more serious and plausible factors like inbreeding, violence, pathogens and anatomical disadvantages related to climate change as the actual culprits. So while the point he was trying to make, that humans are evolutionarily designed for running, which is true, his claim that Neanderthals don't exist anymore because they weren't designed the run like us, is definitely false.Let's talk a bit about the manipulative and deceitful writing for a second. Using statistics is a common tactic to make a point, but when those statistics are disingenuous or outright false, I can't help but suspect everything else that's said in the book is probably false as well. Just take the example of the injury rates in runners (80% per year, apparently) which doesn't take into account the seriousness of the injuries. A cramp or a minor pulled muscle is technically an injury, one that most people in most sports experience. However, using those in his fear-mongering statistics paints a picture that's very far from what most runners actually experience. I won't even go into his claim that 99.9% of people can't qualify for the Boston marathon since it makes me angry just thinking about the stupidity of it. Apart from the bad use of statistics and scientific literature, I also found the pretentiousness of the writing at times incredibly annoying like describing running as the first art form humans created or trying to convince us that the running tribe would be living in some kind of utopia if it wasn't for those pesky westerners. Some parts of the book were palatable like a couple of racing sequences, but even those often felt fictionalised due to the omniscient writing perspective and constant hyperbole. I honestly found it hard to believe a single statement in this entire book. I didn't enjoy it all and I would actively discourage people who are considering reading it. There's just too much bad science and biased writing to counteract the somewhat entertaining story that I imagine some people could enjoy on its own. As it is though, you'd be better off just going for a run in your modern running shoes instead of spending your time on this 'book'."

67,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4123952-alasse,Rating 5 out of 5,"I'm having a really hard time finding the words for this review.I think I should start by saying I don't do ""inspiring"" books, or sports movies of any kind. I think it's because of the same reason I never give pep talks to patients. I find it sounds corny and fake, and it reeks of self-importance. Which is probably the reason I connected with this book on such a deep level.After injuring himself repeatedly while running, Christopher McDougall did some research and heard about the Tarahumara, a lost tribe in the Mexican Barrancas del Cobre, who happen to be the world's greatest athletes - they run up to 200 miles in the blistering heat, in handmade sandals, just for fun. He decided to track them down, and eventually was able to contact Caballo Blanco, a mysterious American who has lived among the Tarahumara for years. This ends up leading to a 50-mile race along the Copper Canyons, populated by a band of distance runners so wacky and diverse it seems too good to be true.Now, this is how the book has been marketed, and that's what happens in it, mostly. But the whole ""gonzo reporter finds lost tribe of superrunners and learns their secrets"" scenario leaves out the fact that ultrarunning is, actually, a legitimate sport. Well, it's not exactly popular or respected, but it's definitely a thing, even beyond Tarahumara borders. This means that, almost from the beginning, McDougall sets out on a series of apparent detours. The Tarahumara storyline is abandoned for a good part of the book, and instead what ensues is a multilayered, panoramic view on everything surrounding running - the stories of the people who would go on to participate in the Copper Canyon Ultramarathon are intertwined with chapters on vegan diet, evil shoe companies and evolutionary biology.But the most important thing about it (or, at least, what really makes this book different and real) is that it all happens on the outskirts of the official sports scene. These supermen are the underdogs. There's a feeling of purity and amateurishness to it all, like these people have no expectations put on them, no sponsors, no inherited knowledge to accept or question. They've invented a sport from scratch, and only now are they realizing they're in fact rediscovering a long lost art.What I mean is, Born to Run reads more like a runner's personal journey of discovery than it does like, say, a special issue of Runner's World. It isn't a testosterone packed instructional book, but a heartfelt ode to endurance and zen running - that beautiful feeling of recovering the awareness of your own body and the boundaries of your own skin. It's epic joy. EPIC JOY. Can joy even be epic? Anyway, it's pure joy, and it's epic, so it's epic joy.I have never been so inspired by a book in my whole life. I've rarely been more exhilarated, either. It may actually have changed my life, though it's too soon to tell. For now, this morning I ran barefoot for the first time (4 km, no pain, absolutely LOVED it) and I'm already training for the marathon next April. Half-marathon really, potentially marathon. We'll see."

But still I started this book with trepidation; everyone I know, runners and nonrunners, had raved about it, and yet the beginning left me rolling my eyes, thinking it would be yet another book about how the Author's Personal Experience led to Revelation about some Issue. Which usually bores me.Fortunately, I was wrong. This is a book about a lot of things: about evolutionary anthropology, and biomechanics, and the invention and marketing of modern running shoes; about the Tarahumara of Mexico, who run long distances over rough terrain in rubber-tire-soled sandals; about ultramarathons, and the nutcases unusual people who run them; about the self-invented crazy gringo indio El Caballo Blanco, and the epic race he organized between the best of the Tarahumara runners and the best American ultrarunners; and yes, even a little bit of the Author's Personal Experience.The story is framed by that of McDougall's trips to Mexico to meet the Tarahumara and learn about their experiences, and ultimately to race - well, not exactly alongside them, more like a good deal behind them, but you know what I mean. But the real meat is in the tangents. He talks about the druglords in Mexico, the customs of the Tarahumara people, the history of the Leadville 100 trail race, the nutritional value of chia, the differing structures that support the head of a human and the head of a pig. It's all fascinating. And best of all are the biographical bits of all sorts of people, from ultrarunner Ann Trason to ultra-huckster Rick Fisher (who, incidentally, my husband knew in college, and for whom he has not one iota of respect). By the time we have met all the players and are ready for the 50-mile race that forms the backbone of this book, we are rapt.I was equally fascinated, but less convinced, by the parts of the book that are sometimes quoted to ""prove"" that humans evolved to hunt animals by running them down, and we should do so barefoot and while eating a vegan diet. (I have read other evolutionary anthropological studies that suggest the more important development was the brain getting big enough to make the calculations needed to figure out how to throw a rock at a running animal and hit the target. And why hunt animals if you're a vegan, anyway?) Fortunately, McDougall himself doesn't present this as polemic but as support for the basic contention that running is a natural thing for humans to do and shouldn't cause injury when done properly. (I should add here that I ""read"" this book by listening to the audio version while, you guessed it, running. I know I surreptitiously adjusted my form while listening to passages about biomechanics and how the best runners glide along so effortlessly.)Maybe his more controversial conclusion is that running makes you a better person, and that being a good person makes you a better runner. I don't know if he's right. But I'm willing to give it a shot."

I finally got it from a friend after pleading for a book during a bout of Covid.I'm giving it a 4 as it's an entertaining and informative read, with some gripping passages. And the author in my opinion is committed to the pursuit and exposition of running as an activity.I hold back from a 5 because I was really irritated by the style and the mythologising on occasion. Where no one is a person but a badass, and phrases like you want to see some criminal assault? or you don't put a hand near his face unless you're dead drunk or dead serious. Snore! At times it never lets up but reading back I realised it only applied when a. he was talking about Americans and b. the ultramarathon community there. When it's used though, it reads like a desperate freelance writer making a pitch to a magazine.There are so many elements, themes, and characters in this narrative, much of it fascinating to me. At core there are the indigenous Tarahumara, fabulous runners in the Sierra Nevada mountains of Mexico and then the ultrarunners and associated community from further North, with many a crackpot in plain sight. And the more grounded running coaches with their data, their theorising, their kindred fanaticism. Beyond them the creators of spiritual systems and deities with running the nectar to worship and access these mythologies. Among these can be numbered the author himself who goes far in attributing basically the decline of civilisation to not hunting by running.And to wearing running shoes!In point of fact, the myriad of interweaving story lines is akin to a Christopher Nolan film. Though you have to ask whether the narrative merits it or whether it would improve with more simplicity.McDougall can write in a clear style. One of my favourite chapters is 28, towards the end, when he proves to this reader at least that humans used their running ability and copious sweat glands in order to hunt faster prey to exhaustion.He follows this with a brilliant and moving description of a race in the mountains, the Tarahumara versus a very good American and others of varied talents, including himself in last place. I'm sure he's been criticised from many angles, including whether he told the truth, but at its core this is a faithful and sincere book which respects and even loves the participants."

It's been a long time since I read a book like I was thirsty for water after a ... 100 mile run through the Death Valley, suppose. See? Now everything comes in running terms, and I'm so far away from being a runner or even a brisk walker! It impressed me so much through it's layering, with an accent on the raw feeling that I now understand running gives; it impressed me because of the people, the men and women (or women and men) who pushed themselves further and further until there was no further to go to. so they invented it. I loved this book so much, and now I am so sad I finished it. Books like this don't come on your ... track ... every other day, so it's a treasure and a thing to be treasured.especially because it's non fiction, you'd expect it to be not so sentimental and delve in facts, not feelings. surprisingly, the best thing it does is that it instills this emotional frenzy in you when you comprehend the passion and dedication these runners have for their sport. i myself am not much an outdoorsy kind of girl; i do enjoy nature and i'm more than happy to spend time in secluded, wild places. but sport? uuuuhm, not so much. i have all the respect for these mega athletes who define what running can mean to humans. besides the emotional part, you'll also find a lot of scientific facts about running and the evolution of man when this variable was introduced."

Instead, it's a real page-turner with suspense in almost every chapter, wacky characters and a physiological examination of some of the most interesting individuals in sport - the ones who are willing to endure ridiculously harsh conditions (like running 217km in Death Valley, in July) without any realistic claim to fame or fortune.The latter parts of the book go heavy into the philosophical and evolutionary underpinnings of running. The author's narrative is captivating: we were born to run, it's not only our unique physical advantage in the animal kingdom, but also the source of our intelligence, the cure for all diseases and the secret of a long life - thus one would do well to ditch the comforts of modern civilisation and attune our bodies to their base aspiration to just run. My scientific skepticism made me wince at times in these chapters, as it got further from solid science and closer to the author's dream.But in the end it matters little whether the Running Man theory is correct or if barefoot beats sneakers - this book WILL get you hyped about running, possibly at dangerous levels where you will want to go from couch to ultramarathon in a month 😄 So stay safe and enjoy the most primordial type of movement our bodies are capable of!"

So many questions on my mind but not many answers.The book was inspiring, it felt like an invitation to run freely and naturally, because indeed we are born to run, we are blessed with legs and muscles that can move powerfully and gracefully. So why waste this great potential sitting and limiting our mobility.An invitation to run without overwhelming ourselves with the latest scientific discoveries and training plans or trendy devices/ watches, gears, shoes, outwears or whatever… all of these did sort of put me off running when I was just starting. Of course I appreciate all the science and physiology behind running and improving sports performance and endurance, but it felt so liberating to see that many people can “outrun” themselves without all of this, just by paying attention and listening to what our bodies are telling us.My running goal would be to seek balance between “natural/ pure” running and “scientific” running, and of course to keep enjoying “befriending the wind”Overall the book was good, I just didn’t like the language or the way it was written much.

Firstly, the book widens my view of running not as literally a sports or some hard workout to trim off some kilos, instead, it is much of a community connection. I am amazed on the story of a tribe living on running, a gringo spending his life in the wilderness to protect the pure joy of running, an elite athlete slowing down to cheer up the weary partner, ... . Running is supposed to care for others. Now I stop listening to blasting music or disassociate from others by being silent while running. It feels better to open with chitchat. Secondly, the book is full of amazing characters. I am not sure if their ""real"" version is as inspiring as they are characterized, I am happy enough believing in the story and cultivation my running motivation.On the other hand, I found myself confused and doubtful throughout the book. As Mr. McDougall took readers on journey to events/moments that he did not even presents. So I am not sure of its accountability and many things should have been exaggerated. Anyway, nothing is perfect. I am happy that it meets my expectation of finding a ""why"" for my running rather than by smaller clothes sizes :) "

It makes marathons seem like walks in the park. Some people complained that this book is like a long magazine article. Well, I like some magazine articles. In fact, I like a lot of articles from The Atlantic, The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, etc. So, I am not sure why that is a bad thing. This book opens up a world, a people, that I didn't know existed. Why didn't I? Why doesn't everybody? And, why does everyone I see running past my house every day have such big frowns on their faces? And, why don't we all eat salads for breakfast? Why do we wear shoes and why does Nike exist? And, where can I buy pinole? Well, I learned answers to many of those questions, including, ""What is keeping me from running?"" (Answer: laziness.) The book, story, characters, information and race are fascinating. It only bogged down slightly over the course of the few pages dedicated to evolution. That aside, the book has a very nice flow to it, going back and forth between the main story, mini-stories and informational asides. I liked ""Born to Run"" so much, I may run in the morning."
76,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/144826562-john-allan,Rating 5 out of 5,Before reading this book my relationship with running was mixed. I remember middle school and high school track used to be a reminder of my average running ability. In college I ran barefoot on the 3 mile trail and fell in love again. I overtrained to do a 31 mile run with experienced runners and felt burnt out by the desire to keep up with their pace and be at their level quickly. One of my favorite quotes in this book said “she just ran because she loved to feel the breeze on her face as she went” I have started running with that attitude and feel a smile creeping on my face when I’m in the middle of a run and feel a slight breeze as my stride opens up. I loved Mcdougals writing style and am thankful for his inspiration to me about running. I relate to his “OSO” (bear) like run and I am thankful to know I’m not the only one out there who’s a big guy that likes to run!!

O que duvidei de cara. Mas descobri que os Tarahumara realmente existem. O livro segue com o caminho de ""iluminação"" do autor sobre corridas de longa distância e o jeito certo de correr, falando muito bem sobre a ciência da corrida e valores novos do esporte que foram descobertos bem recentemente. Gostei demais e me ajudou bastante a formar o nerdologia sobre evolução da corrida. Além de terminar com uma história emocionante e real (embora um pouco forçada).

I am now one of those crazy people who occasionally go on a hike/trail run barefoot which has been such an interesting experience for me. Unlike “normal” running, barefoot running feels like such a full body experience (rather than ankles/thighs/hams). I almost feel like I am doing contemporary dancing on the trail trying to let those rocks melt into my body. After such a hike/run I almost feel like after a good stretch (rather than in dare need of one). "

Cuốn sách vô cùng thú vị, hấp dẫn và truyền cảm hứng. Đọc xong thì không thể lấy cớ này nọ mà không chạy được nữa =))Gặp chấn thương liên tiếp, McDougall luôn đặt ra câu hỏi ""tại sao chân tôi lại đau"" và câu trả lời của bác sĩ ""vì chạy bộ"", nhưng vì không tin câu trả lời này, tác giả đã tìm kiếm câu trả lời ở một nơi khác. Tình cờ biết được thông tin về bộ tộc Tarahumara, ông đã đi sâu vào vùng hẻo lánh của Mexico, kết thân với Caballo, cải thiện khả năng chạy, và tham gia vào một cuộc đua kỳ lạ nhất thế giới (điều kiện khắc nghiệt về thời tiết cũng như địa hình, cùng với các racer là VDV hàng đầu TG superstar, 1 barefoot runner, 1 nữ ultra runner và những người chạy bộ giỏi nhất ở Tarahumara). Câu chuyện không chỉ dừng lại ở đó, cuốn sách còn đi sâu vào các nghiên cứu của các nhà khoa học về chạy bộ. Và câu trả lời có thể khiến chúng ta vô cùng ngạc nhiên: con người sinh ra để chạy bộ chứ ko phải đi bộ, và cụ thể hơn ở đây là chạy đường dài. Những bằng chứng khoa học về kết cấu cơ thể (gân Asin, lòng bàn chân, nuchal alignment from head to heel, butt,... không hề có ở các loài động vật có vú và di chuyển bằng việc đi bộ; hệ thống mồ hôi tỏa nhiệt khác so với các động vật có khả năng chạy khác) đã minh chứng rõ ràng cho việc con người được sinh ra là chạy bộ, v�� đó cũng là lí do vì sao chúng ta sống sót so với giống người Neanderthal khác (khỏe hơn, nhanh nhạy hơn) (phần sử học này có thể đọc thêm ở cuốn Sapien - Lược sử về loài người). Nhưng vì sao con người chúng ta lại không chạy bộ, hoặc thấy nó là một điều rất khó khăn; bởi vì bộ não chúng ta luôn tìm kiếm sự hiệu quả và ít tốn công sức nhất; không còn phải đi săn để kiếm thức ăn hoặc chạy trốn khỏi kẻ thù, con người nay có thể ngồi nhà xem film mà vẫn thoải mái và thư giãn, chúng ta dần quên lãng việc chạy bộ chính là phần của chính bản thân mình.""Just move your legs. Because if you don't think you were born to run, you're not only denying history.

It was in my plan to read in 2015 and it got moved up in the queue when I started to prepare for a half marathon coming up. Suffice it to say, this was exactly what I needed. Truthfully, some of McDougall's ""facts"" are questionable and definitely in my mind did not have enough evidence in the book to support it, but really that is minor. This book is a not about the anatomy of running, it's about the love of running. So much of what McDougall says, I feel. For example, I'm nursing an Achilles tendon issue and went out to buy new shoes. The shoes the running store recommended had far less support than the shoes I was training in. At first it was weird, but ultimately I feel and run better. I'm not ready to throw out my shoes for sandals, but it is a demonstrable fact (in my life) that the less supported shoe is better for me. The rationale laid out in the book behind that sentiment, makes sense to me. There were many passages that talked about the spirit and joy of running. I think McDougall catches it and encapsulates it perfectly. Running or moving your legs is quite natural, almost evolutionary. It's the ""couch potato"" that is abnormal. Moving (being active) is essential to our well being physically, physiologically, psychologically, philosophically, spiritually and emotionally. I also enjoyed the camaraderie among the athletes in the book. At runs and races, I've found that to be true. Everyone is a winner at these things and the last finisher is celebrated as well as the first. I came to this book hoping for a little motivation and inspiration for my running in general. I am quite satisfied with the results. I smiled quite a bit while reading this, not necessarily in amusement or humor but in shared emotion. Powerful and motivational. First book this year that I see myself rereading. almost 4.5"

Don't let the title deter you. It's not just a book about running. It's also about the evolution, science, physiology and biomechanics of how we have come to be upright bipeds who thousands of years ago were most likely out-running our protein for dinner to their death. It's also a book about the running culture of the Tarahumara, a hidden tribe in the Copper Canyons of Mexico, who are arguably the best athletes in the world. A few other notable characters and running athletes are featured in the book, but it is the Tarahumara who stand out among the rest. And the author simply stumbled upon all this because he had a running injury and simply asked the doctor 'Why does my foot hurt?' I tried to post pictures of the simple sandals the Tarahumara wear on their feet and the colorful shirts and the white skirts the men wear as they run, but I'm having trouble. Google the images even if you don't read this book. Simply amazing that these men and women can run faster and longer than most humans on earth in these basic 'shoes'. You will actually find yourself wanting to run in them, or even barefoot, and trash your expensive running shoes, like I have. I haven't gotten there yet, but I'm going to try a little barefoot running and see how it goes. This all culminates into, as the subtitle states, 'The Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen.' Scott Jurek, the best ultrarunner (or so he was) and some other superb ultrarunners compete in a 50 mile ultramarathon in Mexico against some of the Tarahumara tribe. I would have loved to have been a spectator. As a runner, a physical therapist, and an upright human being, I recommend this book to everyone and anyone. Well-researched and written. 5 stars.   "

The Tarahumara running Indians - I learned about them (way way back when) when medical lectures on cholesterol always had a slide about their diet/running and LDL cholesterols near 70. McDougall's view through the window of running, and just a little about how the drug cartels impact them, was fascinating.2. Ultra-running, always an interesting subject, people are so varied and weird. (Finished the book last night and 72 yo Marge Hickman is covered in the NYTimes setting up to run the Leadville 100 again). McDougall's take on Scott Jurek is very nice. The bit on Caballo Blanco, the strange gringo central to the story of the Copper Canyon run in Tarahumara country, is a bit overblown, he comes off as a very sad and lonely person, but who knows.3. Running barefoot. Here the science is hyperbolic and very hard to feel any confidence in, especially sprinkled with some pretty absurd theories about chasing down antelope means that humans are born to run. (Don't yell at me, but the science/ theory is not convincing.) That being said, the foot is a wonderful feat of evolution and it's definitely true that sneakers are to make money, not to speed athletes.Much of the writing is so frenetic and out of control that I found myself wanting to throw the book (or my specific e device) at the wall, and I did enough scoffing that my son in law, who heartily recommended it to me, didn't want to talk to me. But ...!! the last chapter on the actual race, now the Ultra Caballo Blanco - is great."

To cap it all off, the author himself was invited to the pre-race carbo-loading party to provide a talk so we managed to get his autograph and had the opportunity to have a great conversation with him. And of course he was wearing the Vibram Five Fingers. The most inspiring and accurate depiction in this book is of the running community and how it can bring people together. Our running story started about a year after we got married and we attempted the 10k first, followed by the half marathon 1 year later and then full marathon another year thereafter. During the course of these 3 years, our running group has grown from about 3-4 runners to over a dozen strong, and all of us remained a very close-knit group to-date even after we've moved from Malaysia to Singapore. And we continuously made new and close friendships forged through running. One thing that I've always experienced in my quest for the perfect running shoes is that I never did well with anything overly cushioned or built-up. In fact, my favourite pair always end up being a mid-range no-frills pair without too much heel/cushioning. And this book kind of explained why that is the case and I figured that minimalism probably suited me. It might not be the best written book there is on running but the message resonated with me so deeply that it'll be constant favourite of mine (and his)."

The book was Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser and the paradigm shift it wrought upon me was tangible and physical. I closed the book and knew I would never eat meat again, and that I would never order fast food with ease. Similarly, Michael Pollan's The Omnivore's Dilemma forever changed how I think about processed foods and nutrition. The feeling I got when I closed Born to Run was very similar, although the topic is pretty different.In one book, McDougall 1) convinced me to stop putting more padding under my feet in the form of expensive running shoes 2) explained recent scientific discoveries that demonstrate that humans are actually evolved to run long distances and 3) opened up a whole new world of ultrarunners, male and female, indian and gringo, all striding along for hundreds of miles at a time.I can't rave enough about this book.I went for a 10 mile run on almost no sleep the day after I finished it. I was tired from staying up to read, but more than that I was excited to run.

And you certainly do not have to be a runner or athlete to do the same. Author Christopher McDougall was a strictly casual runner, but he is also a writer of some repute and has been a war correspondent and journalist - he definitely knows how to tell a story. The book was a fun and easy read. I also listened to the audiobook, as narrated by Fred Sanders and can recommend it as well.McDougall tells the story of a very reclusive tribe of Mexican Indians, the Tarahumara, who live in a remote part of Mexico below El Paso - the Copper Canyons. They have phenomenal long-distance running ability, despite being dirt poor. They live on an extremely simple and spartan diet (except for a big fondness for corn beer!). They enjoy very good health, little disease, and none of the pressures or conflict that plagues modern civilization. McDougall, with the help of a small cast of ultra-distance runners, visits and comes to know and admire the Tarahumara, and ultimately participates in a 50 mile race with them in the Copper Canyons. Along the way, McDougall veers onto some very interesting and informative side ventures, including stories about Nike and running shoes, runners' health, the anthropology of running, and more. It makes for a delightful reading adventure."

I had just about given up on running entirely due to recurring shin splints that I just couldn't seem to get rid of.

Having previously heard of the book, I knew it was something I'd be interested in, so I purchased it immediately, planning to read it on vacation in a couple weeks. Little did I know it wouldn't make that long! Once I started reading the book, I couldn't put it down until I finished reading it.This book gets a lot of credit for fueling the barefoot running movement. While the book doesn't really come out and advocate barefoot running, it does recommend not running in thick-soled running shoes with large heel drop measurements. The main thing I took away from Born to Run was why to run. Every time I read the book, I wanted to get out and run.So how did this book change my life? It helped me learn the proper running technique, so I no longer got shin splints from running. More importantly, however, it taught me to love running again, and why to love running."

102,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4667894-irene,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was unexpectedly wonderful. I was interested in the topic of this book, but I didn't know I was going to get taken on an emotional rollercoaster too.McDougall is a great storyteller. He takes us through the scientific side of running, why we seem to be terrible at it now when our bodies are perfectly suited to it from an evolutionary perspective, how we came to figure that out by doing some anthropology and as usual, the evils of capitalism (this wouldn't be identifiable as one of my reviews without mentioning that at least once). He then turns this book into a love story with running, and all it encompasses for us as a species. It's about collaboration.I was familiar with the idea that we evolved to be persistence hunters to supplement our diet of foraged plants. This book goes into detail. It does fall into the same pitfall that most single topic books fall into, and that's trying to attribute everything we are and can do to that single thing. Running is only one piece of the puzzle. Becoming bipeds happened in conjunction with a whole bunch of other happenings, like freeing our hands to make tools and wield weapons, learning to process grains and seeds into flour, using fire to cook, defend ourselves and see later into the night. This allowed us to make more calories bioavailable for the same amount of work, our jaws to get smaller, our brains to be bigger, our airways to be more efficient. With bigger brains came better communication and collaboration, and the smarter we got, the better hunters we became by developing a theory of mind for other animals. It's really all one big ball of developments that came together to make us the top of the chain predators we are today. This book does, in the end, do a great job of explaining most of this.If the anthropology portion was fascinating, then we get to meet the people. Caballo Blanco is a strange and loveable character, but so are the rest of runners he rounds up. The culture of the Tarahumara is as secretive as it is kind. They sound like beautiful people. The race at the end of this book was thrilling and emotional. A little bit transcendent in a ""we really can do anything!"" kind of way.That is, of course, not really true. Being ultramarathon runners may be in our genes, but living like this is diametrically opposed to existing in Western society. If you want to be a forager and a persistence hunter you pretty much need to abandon everything you're doing and go live in a cave in the mountains, or the savanna. Which you can absolutely do, but it's not exactly practical. As far as diet goes, this book focuses on the people who live in hot places. A prehispanic diet is great for people living in the Andes, but I'm from Spain. My diet is mostly Mediterranean and the ingredients and dishes I eat are different, but essentially, the same. It's not like that if you live above the Arctic circle. There is no such thing as a universal ancestral diet, and while we did evolve to be great runners, we're also good at other things. Like swimming and diving. For a very long time. Above all, we're an endurance species. This also applies to footwear. It's wonderful if you can wear very minimalist shoes or even go barefoot. Unfortunately for me, I'm currently in a climate that goes below freezing temperatures for at least 5 months out of the year. I can't go outside barefoot if I want to keep my toes. If anybody has minimalist shoe recommendations for walking around in snow, I'm all ears!This is a complex book that covers a lot of ground (pun intended), and I loved it. I would suggest reading it as a companion book to other single topic anthropology books, like Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art, Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation, The Triumph of Seeds: How Grains, Nuts, Kernels, Pulses, and Pips Conquered the Plant Kingdom and Shaped Human History, Languages Are Good For Us, Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams, Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle, or even Why Calories Don't Count: How We Got the Science of Weight Loss Wrong."

Skrze svoje skúmanie došiel až k tomu, že spoznal tento kmeň, ktorý patrí k najlepším bežcom na svete, stretol podivného chlapíka, ktorý je priateľom tohto kmeňa a ktorý mal jeden sen - zorganizovať v krajine kmeňa (Medený kaňon) ultramaratón, ktorého sa zúčastnia najlepší západní bežci, ale tiež Tarahumarovia a porovnajú svoje sily. O tom, či sa takýto ultratrail udial (spoiler - áno, zorganizovali to), čo všetko k tomu viedlo, čo autor knihy zažil, ale tiež o tom, prečo bol človek zrodený k behu, ale nie hocijakému. Človek bol zrodený, aby behal dlho, na dlhé vzdialenosti a vytrvalo. Človek predtým, ako lovil nástrojmi, lovil tým, že svoje obete ubehal nasmrť. Popri tom sa naučil dedukovať z rôznych stôp a rozvinulo sa tak aj jeho premýšľanie. To je jedna z hypotéz, ktorú knižka propaguje a ktorá nie je až tak mimo. Druhou tézou je, že v podstate čím drahšie topánky na behanie si kúpite, tým horšie pre vás a tým väčšia šanca, že sa zraníte. A teda, že najlepšie, čo môžeme spraviť, je behať bosí, čo taktiež nie je úplne hlúpy názor.Tretia hypotéza, ktorú knižka trochu nepriamejšie propaguje, hovorí o tom, že behať by sme v podstate mali všetci a že nás to robí lepšími ľuďmi. V nejakom bode sa v knihe objaví myšlienka, že ak máte problém, ktorý nevyriešite trojhodinovým behom pri západe Slnka, tak tento problém nevyriešite nikdy. Parafrázujem, ale je to pekná myšlienka.Posledná veta: ""Chcem, aby ľudia len behali, bavili sa, tancovali, jedli a radi nás navštevovali. V behaní nejde o to, prinútiť ľudí niečo kupovať. Behať sa má len tak."" Caballo Blanco, keď odmietol sponzorov pre jeho ultratrail. A s tým absolútne súhlasím, behať sa má len tak, lebo môžeme.MÔJ NÁZORDôvodov, prečo knihe udeľujem štyri hviezdičky, je viac. Jednak na otázku, prečo máme toľko bežeckých zranení, odpovedá v podstate len tým, že preto, lebo beháme v topánkach a beháme potom zle. O tom, ako sa naučiť behať dobre, sa však priamo z knihy nedozviete, iba ak tak z nejakých opisov, keď autor opisoval serióznych bežcov. Ale aj Zátopek bol super bežec a behal kadejako. Túto otázku teda podľa mňa mohol autor zodpovedať lepšie. Zároveň, a ono to autor spomína aj v poďakovaní, odbočky boli fakt dosť dlhé a ak ste náhodou prestali čítať v polovici, tak ste aj zabudli, kde hlavná línia rozprávania skončila. Neviem, ako by sa to dalo zlepšiť, lebo odbočky boli skvelé, ale pôsobilo to zmätočným dojmom. Tretia vec, ktorá bola trošku prehnaná, je chválospev na Tarahumarov ako najcnostnejších a najlepších ľudí (hneď na prvých 50 stranách), čo však vyplývalo len z toho, že veľa behali. Kniha fakt nepotrebovala takéto prehnané prejavy. Inak je to super čítanie o behaní, ktoré vás baví a ktoré vás núti behať a to veľa a len tak."
104,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44279821-joe-soltzberg,Rating 5 out of 5,"Born to Run was an excellent read. Born to Run tells the story of a journalist that dives deep into the history and science of running and along the way ends up in a race with a group of relentless ultra-marathoners and an indigenous tribe of super runners known as the Tarahumara. Most people hate running. Even more people hate distance running. The thought of running anywhere from 5-20 miles is enough to exhaust even the more experienced runner. But, it turns out that there are a group of athletes known as ultra-marathoners that will run 50 to 100 miles in one continuous race. Further, these races can often occur in treacherous mountains or in deadly environments such as Death Valley. At first one might think this is just a natural result of the super-powered modern day athletes that have achieved feats thought to be impossible (such as the sub-4 minute mile). With all of the advanced training tools, methods, and workouts available to modern day athletes, that would be a reasonable guess. But, it is incorrect. It turns out that for hundreds if not thousands of years a tribe in northwestern Mexico have been regularly running 50 to 100 miles as part of their everyday life. So, if we can't use modern day sports science as the sole explanation for this remarkable distance running ability, then what can we use? McDougall provides a variety of different and interesting theories.The overarching theory that dominates the book is known as the Running Man Theory or the Endurance Running Hypothesis. It argues that humans, in part, evolved to be the ultimate endurance runner. Put in extremely generalized and simplified terms, the idea is that humans eventually developed larger brains because they were consuming more protein rich foods (meat). One might think this was due to the invention of spears/bows for hunting, but this only happened within the last 200,000 years or so and our brains starting getting larger millions of years ago. What did happen around that time though was our body evolved to start running distances (far, not fast). There is a ton of biological evidence (nuchal ligament, sweating, etc.) for this and it matches up with our evolutionary history for the most part. It is thought that early humans were ""endurance hunters"". That is, they chased their prey until their prey simply overheated and died of exhaustion. Humans may not be fast enough to catch an antelope, but they can run for far longer than an antelope can. It is an interesting theory and helps explain why humans are such astounding distance runners compared to other animals. This might explain why there exists a tribe of ancient distance runners such as the Tarahumara. Using this theory as a starting point, McDougall expounds a variety of related ideas about running. One of the main ideas in this book is that your $100 Nike running sneakers aren't helping you at all... In fact, they may be hurting you. If you accept the idea that humans evolved to be superb runners, then you might be wondering why we even need shoes. Humans evolved into runners well before even primitive shoes were invented. One would logically conclude that humans should be pretty good runners without shoes. McDougall presents a ton of evidence suggesting that in many cases shoes can be detrimental to ones ability to run and that if shoes are necessary for protection then one ought to use shoes that are as minimalist as possible. After all, the Tarahumara run tens of miles in primitive sandals. He argues that all of the added heel padding in modern shoes makes us run in a different way and land on our heels, resulting in damage over time and a ton of injuries. When one runs without shoes they land more fluidly and carefully. They spring off their toes and use the front of their feet. This results in less injury according to several studies. It's definitely an interesting idea and something I plan to try out myself soon. The other main idea presented in this book is that running is more ""sacred"" of an art than we as a society currently view it. Running is not just a form of exercise to burn off McDoubles and Twix Bars, nor is it just an athletic competition to see who can run the fastest or farthest. If we can consider the Running Man Theory it makes sense. We wouldn't evolve to do something we see a chore. Instead, one would imagine we would grow to like something that we evolved to do. There is some evidence to support this. McDougall writes:And when things look worst, we run the most. Three times, America has seen distance-running skyrocket, and it’s always in the midst of a national crisis. The first boom came during the Great Depression, when more than two hundred runners set the trend by racing forty miles a day across the country in the Great American Footrace. Running then went dormant, only to catch fire again in the early ‘70s, when we were struggling to recover from Vietnam, the Cold War, race riots, a criminal president, and the murders of three beloved leaders. And the third distance boom? One year after the September 11 attacks, trail-running suddenly became the fastest-growing outdoor sport in the country. Or maybe there’s a trigger in the human psyche, a coded response that activates our first and greatest survival skill when we sense the raptors approaching. When things look down, we run to make ourselves feel better. One very interesting observation McDougall had about the Tarahumara and some of the ultra-marathoners he interviewed was the mindset they had about running. Many of them didn't have super rigorous training schedules or were super competitors that were solely dialed in to beating everyone else in a race. Many of them just ran because they enjoyed it. During a race (at least until the later parts) many of them would be smiling and having a good time. They were happy just to be running. If being human and running is one in the same, then this makes sense. Perhaps this is the mindset we should all take towards running. It isn't a chore; It's human nature. In an interview with a doctor there is the following exchange:""You could literally halt epidemics in their tracks with this one remedy,"" he said. He flashed two fingers up in a peace sign, then slowly rotated them downward till they were scissoring through space. The Running Man.""So simple,"" he said. ""Just move your legs. Because if you don't think you were born to run, you're not only denying history. You're denying who you are.""So overall it was a great book in general. I'd also highly recommend it if you're already into running of any sort (especially distance). It provides some superb insight and ideas into running and human nature in general."

Half scientific paper and half adventure story about the one thing that humanity is best at: running."

117,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1429082-daniel-solera,Rating 5 out of 5,"Several of my friends were shocked that I hadn’t read Christopher McDougall’s memoir. With my running obsession, how was it possible that I hadn’t already devoured this ultrarunning tome several times by now? Surely I had indexed every chapter and feverishly taken notes on every player mentioned. But alas, I hadn’t. So after another emphatic endorsement at one of our parties, I bought it on the spot. Having finished it, I look at my current athletic accomplishments as meager at best. Clearly the author didn’t mean to belittle the average runner’s talents by spending shy of 300 pages discussing superhuman endurance. But at the book’s end, it’s difficult to avoid running away from home and running a 100-mile trail marathon – an impulsive way of saying, I loved this book.The book is part memoir, part ethnography, part adventure. During one of his trips as a journalist, he came across a pamphlet on the mythical Tarahumara, an elusive Mexican tribe famous for their remarkable endurance under extreme conditions and challenging terrain. A casual runner himself, he sets off to learn more about their peculiar knack for running, first by seeking the eccentric and unpredictable Caballo Blanco, a former fighter turned nomad and friend of the Tarahumara. It is not long before he is recruited to Caballo Blanco’s master plan: to stage a 50-mile endurance run with the best of the Tarahumara and the most talented and celebrated 21st century ultramarathoner: Scott Jurek.Along the way, McDougall takes many steps back to detail the biographies of many oddball players, including Caballo himself, Jurek, Ann Trason, Jenn Shelton, Billy “Bonehead” Barnett, Barefoot Ted (who single-handedly earned the endorsement of Vibram’s FiveFinger shoes) among others. He also engages in fun storytelling with the history of the famously brutal Leadville 100 trail marathon. But the most intriguing chapters come towards the end, where he elaborates on the scientific theory that the Great Leap Forward in human intelligence and evolution happened at the same time that we began running longer distances.McDougall also has a strong, some would say controversial point to make: the worst thing to happen to running is the invention of the running shoe. Several of his comrades, both Mexican and American, run with nothing but a thin sandal or the FiveFingers shoe, which is basically an elaborate sock. Using the research of various renowned sports scientists, he attempts to convince runners that the human foot is an astonishing work of engineering and doesn’t need the superfluous bells and whistles of modern running shoes. Since their invention in the 1970’s, running injuries have increased dramatically, keeping every manufacturer from confidently standing behind their product. Yet, so-called “conventional wisdom” tends to prevail and running shoes keep jumping off shelves.Born to Run is a fantastic read, even for those who hate running. It’s the story of adventure in unknown and dangerous lands, a tale of self-discovery in a hectic world. But most of all, in very clichéd terms, it’s about testing the human spirit and pushing it to inconceivable limits. You don’t have to bolt out the door and run a “short” 30-miler to enjoy this book, but be prepared to lace up when you’re done."
118,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2197383-natasha,Rating 2 out of 5,"This book would convince me to run barefoot (actually, with Vibram Five Fingers) if I were inclined to run in the first place ; ) Actually, the argument for barefoot running is why I read this book. The book wasn't exactly what I expected, but it was interesting nonetheless. In my opinion, the author attempts to tackle way too many topics for one book. It is inconsistent in narrative style (first v. third person, casual v. academic, etc) and there appears to be no logical flow or sequence to the multiple topics presented.The book is part entertainment/storytelling, part interview, part anectdotal, part autobiographical, and part ""research"" (summarizing various articles published in health magazines). It TOUCHES on amateur, professional, collegiate, and Olympic events/training. MENTIONS a physically challenged runner/trainer. It briefly mentions a few coaches' ideas about training. Presents some great information about Nike's marketing strategy for athletic shoes. Jumps back to adventure story in Mexico. Mentions a few university studies, physiology labs, and animal models. Tosses in some theories about the evolution of man. Talks about other people who have dropped out of school or society to follow lost tribes in Mexico or Africa. Attempts to describe various personalities in ultrarunning. Anthropology. Culture. Language. Travel. Peace, Love and Harmony. If you are getting irritated just trying to follow this summary of what is IN the book, please know that is exactly how you are going to feel while READING the book. The story finally (and I do mean FINALLY) winds back around to the story of the particular ultimate race which -I think?- was the purpose of the book in the first place. The whole experience seems awesome- although, just like all of the topics presented, just didn't provide the level of detail needed to truly describe that experience. I was left wanting more. On everything.I would have preferred the author divide his wealth of information into several individual books that focused on each topic, in more depth. For example: write a awesome, descriptive, suspenseful, detailed travel narrative building up to that ultimate race experience in Mexico (what potential here!) Sure, write about the history & culture of ultramarathons and similar events. Expand more on the whole-food vs. ""science-based"" nutrition that was briefly mentioned throughout this book. Dedicate an entire book summarizing the science, physiology and practice behind barefoot running. Write an entire book on lost tribes and their running heritage and culture. I felt like this book had a lot of potential. There is a lot of material here that just wasn't developed in the way it could have been. The author's passion for running, and quest for knowledge shines through. But he's shortchanging the reader, and himself, by trying to include too little about too much in one giant effort. Just from reading Born To Run, I *know* this guy has more stories to tell- tell them, Mr. McDougall... tell them in all of their glory! Let your reader really FEEL what it was like to partake in these adventures! Skip all the extraneous stuff :)"
119,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39362386-cp-wayne,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is an interesting book built around the sport of long distance running. It includes elements of a memoir, adventure tale, sports history and science into one. On a high level, it is separated into different segments: 1) Research and narrative on the Tarahumara people: a traditional tribe of Native Americans located in the remote mountains of Northwest Mexico known for generations of superhuman running abilities. They can run super distances (over 300kms) across rugged mountains and dangerous terrains - often in barefoot or thin sandals. 2) The research and medical history of the humans: including revolutionary science in relation to the sport of ultrarunning, discussions on how humans have evolved and developed traits for running over time. It also presents hypotheses suggesting why modern running shoes may work against us and be the cause of injuries. 3) An adventure tale through the eyes of McDougall and his cooperation with Caballo Blacno: The pair emerge on a quest to gather a group of passionate western ultra runners to race against the Tarahumara. We are introduced to various characters and sub stories, these background narratives diverge on how the sport on long distance running got popularized.Essentially, all these parts are interconnected into the buildup for the final race - a marathon between Tarahumara people and the group of ultra Runners in the dangerous trek of the canyons aka the home of the Tarahumara. Overall, this was an interesting read that surprised me - as I never imagined a book about ultrarunning can turn out to be so interesting. The ending was inspiring as it highlights the human spirit and sportsmanship of people coming together through a common passion. It also did a great job of giving us front row access to the Tarahumara people. It gives us a glimpse into the world of amazing athletes with rich history and traditions. I was amazed to learn what some of them can physically achieve. It makes me realize I have nothing to complain after one of my so -called hard workouts. Science-wise the book makes an interesting theory behind running shoes and why they might be working against us and may be the main cause of running related injuries. In that sense, I think back to my naive days where I would run outdoor in basketball shoes and wonder if that was the reason why my feet hurt so much after. Improvements on this book:There were a lot of unrelated ideas compiled into this book. I thought many of them had enough merit to have it’s own book entirely. For example, I felt like the research on the Tamahara people could been expanded into a very interesting book. I find the part written about them to be so interesting and like many others I wanted to learn more about them. At times, the book was hard to follow as there were several side stories and characters to keep track of. Lastly, the book took a while to build up the final race but the ending came abruptly which was kind of anticlimactic and not as satisfying as anticipated.

121,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4848184-bill-krieger,Rating 2 out of 5,"I agree with a lot of the substance in Born to Run. I'm a recreational runner, and I fully appreciate the zen aspects of running and running for the joy of it. I even buy some of the author's barefoot running thesis. But Born to Run is written like an article in one of those magazines like Men's Health or Runner's World or something. The writing style is pure hyperbole. This runner is the most amazing ever. Every female runner is an incandescent goddess. Each race and experience and drinking binge is EXCELLENT and AWESOME!!! Blech.The focal point for the author's over-the-topness (he he) is the remote Mexican tribe that runs long distances in the Copper Canyon: the Tarahumara (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarahumara_people). McDougall empowers this tribe with virtually having found the meaning of life in their isolated caves. Well, OK. But it's ironic (and moronic) that the author dotes on the holistic qualities of the tribe, and yet his aggrandizing of the Tarahumara has a decidedly American feel to it. It almost feels like he is marketing the tribe... and, of course, himself.This was a 1-star book for me, but I added a star because of some of the interesting facts that McDougall included:1) US marathon running, sort of, peaked with Frank Shorter in the 1970's. McDougall attributes this to the artificial nature of the training and preparation that our runners go through now. They have lost their joy of running.2) Women are slower than men, in every distance from 40 meters to a marathon. But after 26 miles, so-called ultra-marathons, the gap between men and women mysteriously disappears. On a percentage basis, more women finish ultra-marathons than do men. Interesting.3) Running injuries are on the rise, and it seems that being injured is a practically a part of distance running these days. The author attributes this, in part, to running shoes. The idea is that the cushioning of running shoes leaves your feet weak and this shifts the stress of running to the rest of your body. That sounds intriguing to me. I might incorporate some barefoot runs (on a track or field) as part of my running this summer. We'll see.Running barefoot... too bad we're a little beach poor here in Illinois.Oh, one last side note. Wow, I'm a real outlier on this book. Goodreads loves it, and many reviewers seem truly inspired by the book. It's cool. I say... Vive la différence!yow, bill"
122,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/156533-rob,Rating 4 out of 5,"Every other review of this book that you read will sum this up pretty well: that this book is a briskly-paced, well-executed tale of running, of a ""secret tribe"" in Mexico that has basically made an art of ultra-running, of the people world-wide that are truly passionate about putting their bodies into motion and not stopping for hundreds of miles. Also, that your fancy shoes are the reason you're getting plantar fasciitis.So if you want the details on all that, and if you want to get pumped up about barefoot running (you pervert) then have right at it.Instead, I want to put out there a serious question about what seems like a pretty big inconsistency in the text that I'm having trouble reconciling:First -- there is quite a bit in the text where it seems that McDougall is suggesting that a vegetarian diet is the way to go for the elite ultrarunner. Put down your lean meat and go after the beans and pinole. Runner after runner in chapter after chapter, all of them seem to say that they've gone and eschewed meat, that they ""eat like a poor person"", and they've never felt better, and never run better (nor run longer). And yet...Second -- there is this section where McDougall starts talking about the evolution of Homo sapiens, and this conjecture that we ""defeated"" our Neanderthal cousins in the evolutionary arms race because we ""ran our prey to death"". In other words, our species learned to run so that it could more easily obtain meat, and the improved access to meat was a huge driver behind the survival of our species, behind the further development of our brain.But this contradiction isn't really explored. Evolution has strong feedback effects built in. So if we're running to get meat, why eschew the meat hundreds of thousands (millions?) of years later? Does the access to the meat simply open the door and once through it we're better off without it? Or is there more to this story?------Update: Longer version of this review on my blog."

Honestly, I have no idea.Running has been a big part of my life for some time now. For the last ten years I’ve run. So it’s hard to say. When you put enough time into something, it’s pretty hard to separate yourself from it. I can’t write a review from a non-runner’s perspective because that would be total speculation on my part.What I can do is tell you that this is a fantastic book. If you are a runner, this is a must-read, easily the best book about running out there, and I’ve read a ton. You won’t find anything this in-depth, in touch, and you’ll never read anything else that gives you the vicarious thrills of superathletes and scientists alike.The story is about the greatest endurance race of all time, but really that’s only a small part. It’s about a man who is feeling his body age and trying to figure what he can do about it. It’s about Caballo Blanco, a living legend whose story, a tall tale, is only more incredible because it is 100% true. The story of the Leadville 100 and the Tarahumara racing against Ann Trason is one of the best sports stories on the planet, expertly told by McDougall, and as any great sports story, it brings about greater truths about who we are and why we run.More than anything, this books sets out to prove its title. Through science, through example, and through story after story of one incredible athlete after another, this book will leave no doubt in your mind that the greatest athletes in the world still like to get their drink on, that a group of humans can run down a deer, and that you and I were born to do it too.It’s motivated me to try some new things. I don’t know if chia seeds are making me faster or stronger. And I can’t say for sure that barefoot running has unchained my feet and transformed them into running machines. But I can say that the spirit of the runners, Barefoot Ted, Scott Jurek, Billy “Bonehead” and Jen, the Lunas, and the dozens of characters in this book, each one more incredible than the last, the spirit of these runners is infectious and fuck this review I’m hitting the road."

I thought this was heading to some mystical hippie BS, given the beginning makes it sound like this ""Stone Age"" tribe had superpowers and the author was in search of this mysterious ""gringo indio"" in Mexico's Copper Canyons known as the ""Caballo Blanco."" I should have known better given it was the Christmas gift of my favorite science geek. (Thanks Jenn!) The subtitle calls it the story of a ""hidden tribe, superathletes, and the greatest race the world has never seen"" and it lived up to its title. McDougall started with a simple question: ""Why do my feet hurt?"" And in answering that question the book looks to physicians, physiologists, evolutionary biologists, Bushmen in a ""persistence hunt""--and the strange breed known as the ""ultramarathoner"" who compete in races as much as 100 miles or 100 kilometers in length. And it takes us to that ""hidden tribe,"" the Tarahumara of Mexico, who call themselves ""the running people"" and have been able to beat elite professional athletes. Some other questions along the way? Why is it that ""no woman [has] ranked among the top fifty in the world in the mile... A woman might sneak into the top twenty in a marathon,"" yet women are competitive--even routinely win--ultramarathons. Why do aspects of our anatomy resemble horses and dogs more than chimps or pigs? And why might we be better off running barefoot than with Nike sneakers costing hundreds of dollars?The book is written like a novel, withholding and giving information skillfully in ways that come together beautifully. It was a surprisingly moving, even inspiring book. After reading some books in the past months about atrocities and the horrible things humans do to each other, this finally gave me back pride in being human."
126,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/250-mythili,Rating 3 out of 5,"I understand why this book has a cult following: McDougall manages to elevate the perfectly boring, utterly commonplace modern-day pastime of recreational running to an altogether higher plane. McDougall has a men's-magazine-writer's gift for imbuing everything he does with machismo; as he explores the fascinating story of the Tarahumara (the ""hidden tribe"" of ""superathletes"" in Mexico) he makes a convincing argument that anyone who runs is participating in something urgently primal, something essential to the human experience, oh, and maybe even key to the survival of the species. The other thing about this book that's so wonderful (besides the incredible sense of superiority it allows any casual runner to bask in) are the oddball characters who populate it. I was saddened to hear about the death of Caballo Blanco recently; in the book, invincibility just seemed part of his screwball approach to running and life. I also got a huge kick out of Jenn, the star-athlete-turned-running-hippie -- she really does sound like some girl from Virginia Beach I might've known in high school. It's a fact that anyone who takes running seriously is a weirdo. But McDougall has managed to round up a thoroughly likeable set of weirdos.As for McDougall's whole barefoot running thesis: Though I have no interest in getting rid of my cushy Asics (or buying a pair of Vibrams), it seems logical enough to me. For being such a simple, intuitive activity, regular running does seem to tend to lead to chronic injury. The fact that overpriced, overbuilt shoes could be part of the problem is entirely plausible. Next time I am due for a new pair of running shoes I'll certainly check out the barefoot-inspired ""minimalist"" shoes that are all the rage."

Мы пробежали с ним болтая в хорошем темпе 10км, после чего он ускорился на финиш, оставив меня бороться с болью в колене на последнем подъеме. Я не успел тогда запомнить его имя, но запомнил название книги, о которой он горячо отозвался и рекомендовал обязательно к прочтению. Что ж, спасибо тебе, неожиданный беговой друг, ""Рожденный бегать"" оказалось более чем вдохновляющим и захватывающим путешествием!Примечательно, что начинается книга с вопроса автора - ""Почему болит моя нога?"", в поисках ответа на который он проходит путь от медицинского кабинета лучших докторов Америки до нетронутых цивилизацией Медных каньонов Мексики, где обитают счастливые бегуны племени тараумара. Книга написана в приключенческом жанре журналистских заметок, наполнена ярчайшими образами выдающихся реальных личностей, о которых большинство людей никогда бы не услышали. Супермарафонцы, да и все бегуны в нашем мире считаются чуть ли не тронутыми. МакДугал же убедительно подводит читателя к идее, что бег есть наиболее естественная форма существования и самовыражения для человека. Особняком стоит Глава 28, в которой автор популярно-научно открывает для читателя совершенно новый взгляд на теорию эволюции человека. Поверьте, она произведет на вас сильнейшее впечатление.Как бы вы не относились к бегу, после прочтения книги ваше отношение к нему точно улучшится. ""Просто пошевели ногами, поскольку если ты не согласен, что рожден для бега, то отрицаешь не только историю, а отрицаешь свое естество."" ""Вы перестаете бегать не потому, что стареете, вы стареете, потому что перестаете бегать"""
128,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4943518-denise,Rating 5 out of 5,"What a fantastic book! Christopher McDougall has a special way of making this running niche nonfiction book more like an exciting adventure novel. Mostly it is centered around his experience with the Tarahumara Indians as he travels to Mexico in search of their secrets to a pain free, fast, and easy running lifestyle. This community isn't home to just your typical great runner. They are a tribe of ultra runners, often running tens to hundreds of miles a day, and do all of this while running with no shoes. No easy feat, especially in the harsh hot rocky climate of the Barrancas del Cobre (a group of canyons in the Sierra Madre). What keeps this community alive and in peak form is their dedication to supporting each other, and keeping their lives unstained by the modern world.The Tarahumara Indians have a completely different approach to running compared to modern athletes. They focus more on being one with the earth and comfortable in their own bodies. Running for them is a way of life, and it is also a form of pleasure and entertainment. From the strange character of Caballo Blanco (""White Horse"" An american outsider who has been unusually welcomed into the Tarahumara Community) to the strange events, this book is nothing short of engaging. For those who are more into the scientific backing of minimalist running this book offers interesting anecdotes along with the main story. The biomechanics and physiology behind what makes an efficient runner are also addressed towards the middle and end of the book. With research and other highlighted observations by Dr. Daniel Leiberman, Bill Bowerman, and countless other doctors and coaches Mcdougall offers a great comprehensive view of what our bodies are capable of.

It's actually several stories: the story of Christopher McDougall, aging runner, who wants to figure out why he keeps getting hurt every time he laces up his running shoes; the story of the Tarahumara Indians of Mexico, who still manage 50-mile runs in their fifties and sixties in some of the world's most challenging terrain, and do it with smiles on their faces; the story of ultra-runners, who don't find marathons challenging enough and push themselves through hundred-mile races; the story of the running industry (complete with why your running shoes might be hurting you), the story of Caballo Blanco, a gringo from Colorado who met some Tarahumara at an ultra race, followed them to Mexico, and stayed, always dreaming of getting the world's best ultra runners and the Tarahumara together to run the world's greatest race.A few weeks later, I'm still thinking about this book. When I get up in the morning to do my daily six or seven miles, I think about running light, fast, easy, and being happy while I do it. I'm making lists of books to read with titles like Chi Running. I'm very interested in the idea of running barefoot, although I haven't tried it yet. I'm even thinking about the possiblity of not being capped at 26.2 miles (seriously?). But even if my running never changes, I'm so glad that I read this story. "

I wanted to read it because I’d heard so much about it, but I feared I’d be quite bored since I’m not a runner (and don’t have interest in becoming one). In short, it didn’t disappoint! I actually found it rather hard to put down. It takes the reader into the lifestyle of a very hidden tribe of people located in Mexico, who live on the simplest diet and lifestyle. Running is a natural component of their culture, with individuals running anywhere from 30-50-100+ miles at any given time. They literally just pick up and GO... often barefoot. (How much Westerners spend on getting “the best” footwear is highlighted, with a spotlight on Nike, and how much more harm than good those types of shoes may be doing.) The story goes deep into how these folks “are the way they are” - biologically, mentally, physically, culturally - and how they compare against Western ultra marathoners. I also loved learning more about how running influenced the evolution of Homo sapiens - it’s so fascinating!Overall, this story’s eclectic cast of characters, as well as its blend of history, storytelling and comedic relief, is a great read for both runners and non-runners alike (although I’d be curious what a runner thinks of it... Nicole, I’m looking at you :))."

So like most runners (or wannabe runners), I picked this book up. I wasn't sure what to expect, and it was a bit of a disappointment. The first chapter on barefoot running and the history of running shoes was 75% of the way into the book (no kidding, I read an electronic copy and I checked).The book was about 85% talking about this guy's history with running, and some other guy's history with running, and a tribe of people's history with running. With *lots* of swearing and drinking thrown in.The rest of the book was the part I was actually looking for--the parts about why barefoot running is good for you, how modern running shoes came to be (and how the problems that plague today's runners didn't exist before modern running shoes), how we actually evolved to be distance runners, what you should eat to be a good runner (vegan, actually). This was the most interesting part of the whole book. So if that's the kind of thing you're interested in, skip to the last quarter of the book and start reading and skimming around from there. Had I not read an ebook, I probably would have gotten frustrated a bit earlier and done the same."

I walked away from it with an appreciation for Christopher McDougall as a wonderful and creative writer, as well as a lot more information regarding the social and medical history of humans as runners. What an inspirational and well written book!! Two of the most impressive things I've learned from this book:1. Watching my son run is the best way to learn how to correctly run myself. My 3-year-old speed demon on two legs has the Tarahumara way down pat! In fact all little kids do, it's the adults who get lazy and stiff.2. Go barefoot! It's the natural way humans were meant to walk and run. Forget spending $100 bucks on a pair of running kicks. In fact, the more you spend the worst off you are! Kick the cushioning gel soles and microchip self-correcting inserts to the curb. Thanks Christopher McDougall.I would suggest anyone who is interested in reading a terrifically written, nonfiction, inspirational health-based cultural expose meant to teach someone the history and method of marathon running should be reading this already.10 Stars."

Noble Savage...Evolutionary Biology!The Tarahumara are superhuman! They run for days and live in canyons that would kill anyone else who tried to live there! They don't get heart disease or diabetes and are unaffected by age! They're uncorrupted by the filthy claws of Mammon, instead freely sharing all their possessions and occasionally trading corn beer for favors! They drink said beer like fish and have all-night raves followed by all-day running matches, but don't have problems with spousal abuse or public drunkeness! They know how to make 
lembas
, except it's a drink and they call it iskiate! They're as stealthy as ninjas, and you can walk in front of a Tarahumara house or through one of their villages without even knowing it was there! They're all beautiful and tall and well-muscled and sun-bronzed and, ""Probably not since the days of the ancient Spartans has a people achieved such a high state of physical conditioning,"" and they're probably robots! Or aliens!Alien robots?Okay, McDougall is reporting an article he read that made all these claims and not explicitly making them himself, though he does wonder what kind of mythical Atlantis the article is talking about and says:It seemed to be some kind of wishful Atlantean legend about an extinct empire of enlightened super-beings. Only gradually did I figure out that I was right about everything except the ""extinct"" and ""wishful"" parts.So, there's definitely some othering going on here. Everyone treats the Tarahumara as either some kind of precious jewel--a treasure into a lost human past where we didn't have crime or want, where we were in tune with our bodies and in harmony with nature (sound familiar?)--or as a resource to be exploited. The actual text of Born to Run does both.When the book isn't hagiographizingtalking about the Tarahumara, it's using the same style to talk about ultramarathon runners. All the women (and a couple of the men) are beautiful. Everyone is hardcore. Everyone makes ultramarathoning their life, except for one guy who makes it conspicuously not his life to the extent that he shows up, wins races, then disappears back into his hometown and avoids the limelight. They were devoted fanatics, running 100 miles through badlands and mountains and wilderness, until the outside world caught on to the secrets of their clique and ultramarathoning exploded in popularity. Names get dropped, like Scott Jurek or Ann Trason or Eric Orton or ""Barefoot"" Ted or Micah True.And Micah True, or Caballo Blanco--""White Horse""--is where the two different strands of the book intersect. He used to be a boxer, fell in love, got cheated on, worked odd jobs, and eventually moved down to Copper Canyon and lived near the Tarahumara. And there, he got this idea to have ultramarathoners come down to the canyons and run there, against the Tarahumara on their own home turf. They had come to the Leadville 100 in the 90s and done very well, but due to an overzealous promoter and attention they weren't used to getting, they hadn't attended since, and True thought that running on their home territory would avoid that and focus entirely on the part he thought was most important--the running, shorn of the crass commercialism that was starting to define the sport. That's why all these runners get together and go down to meet, and race with, the Tarahumara.Near the end, the book takes a digression into evolution, and why exactly it is that humans seem to well adapted to distance running when few other animals are. We evolved endurance running, it claims, in order to chase down other animals and hunt them simply by outlasting them, following them until they simply dropped dead from exhaustion and letting the hunters eat the meat and get the big brains that came with all that fat and protein. Most animals can run faster than humans, but very, very few can run as far or for as long. Humans were the terminators of the animal kingdom--we absolutely will not stop, ever, until the prey is dead.The problem is that much of the rest of the book tries to point to vegetarianism as the most appopriate diet for athletic performance, indicating the Tarahumara diet (of course) of beans, corn, peppers, chilis, squash, chia seeds, and corn beer as an excellent example. Except, if that's the case...what exactly did those early humans evolve to hunt? Were our ancestors stalking herds of bananas? Chasing a wounded cassava for days across the savannah until it finally collapsed and died of exhaustion? Why would we have so many adaptions for endurance running if the best possible food for humans doesn't require any running at all to acquire? Is it because we needed meat to develop our brains but don't need it anymore? Is it because modern crops are better-suited for modern humans? Who knows--McDougall doesn't make any attempt to resolve this contradiction in his argument. He even says that running after prey was a special occasion thing and only happened when there weren't enough roots and grubs to go around. That's a lot adaptation put in for a special occasion.Maybe the most annoying aspect of Born to Run is the fact that McDougall never uses a mere adjective when a superlative would do, and most of the book seems to flow better if you upend a saltshaker full of exclamation points over it. It's like a tall tale or a campfire story, where the tempo keeps building, the focus changes to catch the listener's attention when it starts to waver, and every new digression is bigger and more exciting than the last. It certainly makes it a quick read, but it makes it impossible to tell how much of Born to Run is true, how much is exaggerated in the telling, how much is lies, and in what proportion each is found. As one article I found about the book put it:What is the secret of the Tarahumara? How are they able to run so far? Why can’t we Americans run as far as they can? Could it be because they spend most of their lives running while we spend most of our lives sitting? McDougall would rather look for magic than settle for such a simple answer. So he romanticizes their culture, and he romanticizes [Micah True] right along with them. The book leaves you with the feeling that you’re not necessarily any closer to knowing the truth about ultra-distance running-–or the Tarahumara or Micah–-than before you started reading.-SourceOn the other hand, it does make me feel better about wearing flipflops or going barefoot as often as I can get away with it, so there was at least one practical effect.If you want a speedy narrative full of larger-than-life characters, Born to Run provides. If you want a well-researched scientific analysis, look elsewhere.Addendum: The fate of Micah True:Somewhat curious about this guy, I went and looked at his wikipedia entry, and it has the really sad note that he failed to return from a run, was found dead near a stream. There was no obvious cause of death, but he had an enlarged heart, which isn't conclusive. Near the very end of the book, he says:""When I get too old to work, I'll do what Geronimo would've if they'd left him alone,"" Caballo said. ""I'll walk off into the deep canyons and find a quiet place to lie down.""And maybe that's what happened, but on the other hand, the book did mention he had a history of fainting spells and one time he had fainted and woken up with died blood matted in his hair and a bandage on his head, courtesy of the inhabitants of the village he had fainted near. If he had been out in the canyons...That isn't really surprising now, when it's pretty well known that endurance exercise causes heart enlargement and possible scarring and damage. But after a book about the virtues of running hundreds of miles a week, and especially because of this line in the wikipedia entry:Due to True's role in the organization and production of the Copper Canyon Ultra Marathon, after his death the continuation of the event was placed in doubt. Nevertheless, there are those who hope to continue it, although its projected form is unknownthere's a lot sadder tone to Born to Run than might otherwise be present."
150,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1121414-morwenna,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book was recommended to me by a friend as we shared an intense conversation regarding existentialism, music, running, spirituality, and theories of time and convergence on my most recent visit to NYC. Invigorated and intrigued by our conversation and my friend's strong endorsement of this book, I immediately resolved to find it. Now that I owe money to the Toronto library (yes, I do intend to pay my fines....eventually), and given the hassle of going to my ""nearest"" branch, I chose to buy this book. A couple chapters in, however, I was extremely unnerved by the cultural paradigm naturally assumed by the author (which I will explore in the following paragraphs). I returned the book in the first week because of these misgivings. I later determined to read the book in entirety before giving up on it - and I have to admit, I'm glad I did.For those of you unfamiliar with the general theme of this book, it is written by a journalist who went in search of alternatives to healing chronic running injuries; in doing so, the author explores running techniques developed by an indigenous group in Mexico - the Raramuri - who are famed endurance runners who traditionally run with only flimsy sandals tied to their feet, and who are generally unaware of chronic running ailments that afflict runners in the US. This is only more amazing given the terrain where the Raramuri live - a remote, unforgiving rocky land consisting of of sharp canyons and drop-offs. The narrative follows the latest trend in running - ""barefoot"" running, and also explores theories of human evolution which claim that humans did not evolve as walkers (as is commonly understood), but rather as endurance runners. In exploring the athleticism of the Raramuri, he compares them with ultra-marathon gurus in America, and the story culminates in an exciting race between the some of the ultra-marathoning greats from the US against the best the Raramuri have to offer in the Raramuri's native turf.This book is exciting (particularly during the races) and generally entertaining. It actively fights against types of consumerism and mainstream (mis)understandings about ultra-marathoning and running, and offers fascinating scientific evidence to support the theory that humans developed as endurance runners, rather than walkers. I found the sections on barefoot running also very informative and compelling; so compelling in fact, that I have been running with a pair of ""5 fingers"" (a shoe designed to simulate barefoot running) for the past month or so.My misgivings about the book center almost entirely on the author's perspective and dissemination of information regarding indigenous peoples. He consistently refers to the Raramuri (their own name for their people) as the Tarahumara (the name their enemies gave them, and which ""stuck""....much like the Sioux/Lakota names) *despite* his acknowledging this very fact. And perhaps I could let this fact go if this was the end of it, but there is a number of ways in which the author perpetuates offensive misunderstandings in regards to indigenous peoples. What do I mean? Throughout the ""evolution"" section, there is a marked reference to hunter-gatherers, and other indigenous peoples as ""living remnants of our prehistoric past."" In essence, indigenous peoples are not as ""advanced"" as Westerners, and he's unconsciously following the old anthropological understanding of human ""progress"" as a ladder moving upwards in time and development: nomadic people; hunter-gathers; farmers; tribe; all the way ""up"" to industrial nation-state. Do you notice a trend? Yep - in this model (that, only coincidentally WE developed), we Westerners are the top of the evolutionary chain...we are the culmination of human progress. And what about those other social organizations? According to this understanding, they are undeveloped, frozen in time and unchanging; these peoples are considered as a kind of temporal throw-back in progress. This denies them agency, and in many ways, personhood - their choices can never be ""real"" since they are merely only ever following ""traditions"" that our people ""progressed"" away from...Where as our choices are real and continuing to move forward in time/civilization, indigenous peoples can only move closer to our place at the top, or continue to occupy the same or lesser cultural space.Of course, Mr. McDougall does not mean to use ""primitive"" in an insulting way, but he uses the lessons learned from the indigenous cultures to critique modern mainstream North American culture. But in doing so, he commits the other major sin against indigenous peoples: he uses these people as an example of a kind of lost innocence and harmony with both nature and our bodies that we modern folks lost in all that progress. Essentially, this is an extension of the problem outlined in the previous paragraph. In this logic chain, indigenous peoples are still considered less developed, and ""closer"" to nature. Both ends of the spectrum put indigenous peoples in a bad place. As James Wilson gracefully put it: ""[Native Americans:] are exotic relic[s:] of some earlier stage that we have already passed through: either - depending on you point of view - a kind of primitive anarchy that we have overcome (in nature, in ourselves) or an innocent Golden Age that we have forfeited through greed and destructiveness"" (excerpt from the Earth Shall Weep).Allow me to clarify: it is not a matter of ""racism"". Rather, his perspectives are infuriatingly common amongst the general population. So, why is it important to discuss and bring these issues to the open? Indigenous peoples still struggle all over the world - with economic problems, health problems, and a wide assortment of social ills - and yep, that includes Canada and the US. These ideas about indigenous peoples still hurts them, because this kind of thinking is part of the problem. But even if you couldn't give a hoot about indigenous peoples anywhere, these themes of ""progress"" should worry you. One of the best explorations of this theme in mainstream culture is the movie ""Serenity"". In this movie, the characters discover that a group of violent, anarchist cannibals were actually an unfortunate and unintended product of a failed government project to control human behavior. The cover-up is in full-swing, and the main characters are caught in the middle. The epic speech delivered by the captain of this crew, meant to galvanize their support in his fight to uncover this truth, is centered around the idea of progress:""Sure as I know anything, I know this - they will try again. Maybe on another world, maybe on this very ground swept clean. A year from now, ten? They'll swing back to the belief that they can make people... better. And I do not hold to that. So no more runnin'. I aim to misbehave.""""Progress"" can be used as easily against other undesireables as indigenous peoples. It was used by the Soviets, the Fascists, and all sorts of other ugly totalitarian regimes. Mr. McDougall does not intend to invoke these ghosts, and yet, I could not ignore them in my reading of his book.This book is written not simply as an ode to running, but also a call for community-building. Despite my critiques, I agree with Mr. McDougall's notion that our modern world has fragmented communities, and keeps us separated. Running, he suggests, is a powerful tool in building community, trust, and bonds. I agree that this is a distinct possibility. The race he describes at the end of the book is a great example of this dream - but it is only a dream for many of us who cannot afford exotic trips to connect with great athletes in remote global locales. We must set aside our ideals of progress, and pursue the loves in our lives - every day. This means that if we love running, we may need to do so in smoggy, overcrowded cities, through industrial wastelands, after working a 11-hour shift. If I'm reading McDougall correctly, this also means building connections to run not only because of our love of running, but for our other loves, as well - running for charity, volunteering our skills to help out locals kids or other community initiatives, or running with family members for some QT. Love builds love.So, this really does come full circle. My love of music, philosophy, and running urged me to read this book, and now I gotta figure out how to build just a little more love."
151,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61264875-abhinaba,Rating 4 out of 5,"It is funny that sixty mile runs are casual for the Tarahumara (read Tara-oo-mara) tribe. Or is it alarming that we, modern homo-sapiens, who could run longer than almost all other species have lost the innate ability? Is it possible for everyone to run that mileage?These were some questions that Christopher McDougall asked himself when he visited Urique(Northern Mexico), originally to find what do the Tarahumara tribes did right to be free of injury and to meet the legend Caballo. In the first quarter of the book he states how difficult it is to get to the Tarahumara tribe due to Mafias notorious for killing reporters and musicians, treacherous unpaved roads, and the recluse nature of the tribe itself. It is impossible to spot a Tarahumara if they want to be hidden. Hidden they must be, that was taught by generations as they were targeted by the outsiders. The atrocities mentioned are truly heart breaking. Micah True aka Caballo Blanco aka The (white)Horse is the center piece of the book. He has a Raramuri soul. There were stories on the mafia, funny conversations between Caballo and Mama, and anecdotes of Ann the Brija; about the people of the tribe, their sports and celebration and corn beer. This was supplemented with history of many ultra marathon runners. If you read the book you will find that it is not completely factual. There are plays of spirits, believes, and fiction along with it. One has to read it with judgement so as to pick the parts that would assist in their running and lifestyle, while removing the points which are pretence. At present times running is for business, fame, money, health which doesn't compare to what we have lost: running for fun, bonding and celebration. It is primarily because we don't have a need for it. It doesn't sound technical but running is more about heart than about statistics and equipments. On shoes“But once you block a natural movement(using shoes),” Dr. Hartmann said, “you adversely affect the others. Just look at the architecture,” Dr. Hartmann explained. ""Blueprint your feet, and you’ll find a marvel that engineers have been trying to match for centuries. Your foot’s centerpiece is the arch, the greatest weight-bearing design ever created. The beauty of any arch is the way it gets stronger under stress; the harder you push down, the tighter its parts mesh. No stonemason worth his trowel would ever stick a support under an arch; push up from underneath, and you weaken the whole structure. Buttressing the foot’s arch from all sides is a high-tensile web of twenty-six bones, thirty-three joints, twelve rubbery tendons, and eighteen muscles, all stretching and flexing like an earthquake-resistant suspension bridge.""On formBefore the invention of a cushioned shoe, runners through the ages had identical form: Jesse Owens, Roger Bannister, Frank Shorter, and even Emil Zatopek all ran with backs straight, knees bent, feet scratching back under their hipsI bent against the rope, churning my legs as I dragged him forward. He released the rope, and I shot off. “Good,” the man said. “Whenever you run, remember that feeling of straining against the rope. It’ll keep your feet under your body, your hips driving straight ahead, and your heels out of the picture.”We share a lot more traits with runners (horses, dogs) than with walkers (pigs, chimps). Although we share about 95% DNA with chimps, we have quite different mechanics for movement. Nuchal(stabilizes head during high speed movement), Achilles tendon, short toes, hefty gluteus maximus are some of the factors. Some miscellaneous points:1. Along with getting more exercise, says Dr. Weinberg, we need to build our diets around fruit and vegetables instead of red meat and processed carbs.2. Don't run on your heels. Body weight should be on the balls of the foot and toes i.e. the front part. Heels don't come into the picture. They are for walking or standing. 3. Chia drink for vitality. There is a local recipe using Chia seeds, chilled water, lime, sugar and salt to make a refreshing energetic drink. 4. A lengthy case was made about why running with shoes is not only unnatural but harmful for us. The arguments seem valid and Nike is useless.5. Must look into the history the Czech runner Emil Zátopek. 6. Running should be easy, light, smooth and fast (in that order).Personally, I've always treated run/jogging as a single activity to put the body in shape. Multiple benefits from one activity, which happens to take bare minimum time to do. And there are fluctuations in how many times a week I run due to lack of true love for running or serious concern for health. After reading this I have come to know that the joy of running comes while running with others, running with nature. There has to be some element of exhilaration.The author put the ""Acknowledgments"" at the end of the book and it made sense. Reading through it felt meaningful.  Side by side, stride for stride, Caballo and I ran into Urique. "

McDougall does a terrific job squeezing in bits of research and complementary anecdotes without losing the focus around the primary story.Notable quotes:“We say the rarájipari is the game of life. You never know how hard it will be. You never know when it will end. You can’t control it. You can only adjust.” p.41“You live up to your own expectations, man.” p.50“He who loves his body more than dominion over the empire can be given custody of the empire.” — Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching p.77“You had to love running, or you wouldn’t live to love anything else.” p.93“There are two goddesses in your heart, The Goddess of Wisdom and the Goddess of Wealth. Everyone thinks they need to get wealth first, and the wisdom will come. So they concern themselves with chasing money. But they have it backwards. You have to give your heart to the Goddess of Wisdom, give her all your love and attention, and the Goddess of Wealth will become jealous and follow you. Ask nothing from your running, in other words, and you’ll get more than you ever imagined.” p.94“His gut kept telling him that there was some kind of connection between the capacity to love, and the capacity to love running. The engineering was certainly the same: both depended on loosening your grip on your own desires, putting aside what you wanted, and appreciating what you got, being patient and forgiving and undemanding.”p.98“If they race the way they party, the Tarahumara don’t have a chance — Where’d you find these two?” p.142“Maybe she’s self-medicating against deep-seated problems, but maybe (to paraphrase Bill Clinton) there was never anything wrong with Jenni that couldn’t be fixed by what’s right with Jenni” p.201“I knew aerobic exercise was a powerful anti-depressant, but I hadn’t realized it could be so profoundly mood stabilizing and — I hate to use the word — meditative. If you don’t have answers to your problems after a four-hour run, you ain’t getting them.” p.213“You and I know how good running, feels because we’ve made a habit of it. But lose the habit, and the loudest voice in your ear is your ancient, survival instinct urging you to relax.” p.243——I’m realizing a lot of my reading has been running-centric this year, but I think it’s a beautiful thing. I’ve really leaned into my training this year and there’s always more to be done. Understanding the history is immensely important."
153,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4020888-maya-sophia,Rating 5 out of 5,"I was hooked from the moment the author details the injury he had sustained whilst running, for which he'd consulted one of the best sports medicine doctors, decided he didn't like the diagnosis and prognosis, and sought two more opinions, both of which told him he was crazy for not listening to the first guy. I felt like we were kindred spirits because I also did not want to accept the prognosis of the knee injury I sustained running four years ago. From there, this book just gets wild and fascinating. He explores the history of a tribe in Mexico called the Tarahumara, who are known for their ability to endurance run. And we're not talking marathons here. We're talking people who regularly run HUNDREDS of miles, usually in what are essentially sandals. From there, he explores the world of ultra marathons and the superathletes that compete in them. These are foot races that last for days and often cover the most grueling terrain. Think Death Valley. Think cliffs. Finally, he looks at the evolutionary purpose of running and there are so many fascets of that which I found utterly fascinating. Running predates tools by more than a million years as a method for catching prey that was necessary to fuel large human brains, and that is reflected in the fossil record. He goes into how that was discovered, the different theories about why it happened, and then compares humans to other walkers and runners in the animal kingdom. Thoughout all of this, he expertly weaves in his own story about becoming a barefoot endurance runner, which takes the reader to a footrace he ran with the Tarahumara. Everything about this book was so interesting and engaging to me. It was well written, genuinely funny, but also very well researched. It struck a great balance between being a memoir while also being scientific and research based.I was surprised by how much I loved this book. I geuinely want to push myself now. I somehow doubt I'll ever be doing ultramarathons, but I've been convinced that endurance running is the innate superpower of humans and it really inspired me to lean into that now that my knee injuries (Yes, plural. I'm so good I can fall once and take out both knees.) have healed."

The author makes the argument that we have forgotten how to run and are actually biologically built for long distance running by using stories of epic races, science, anthropology, and evolution to support his claims. At times the stories seem embellished or facts conveniently missing, but it still makes for an overall compelling read.The reason for 5 stars? This book has made a huge difference in my running. It motivated me to start running regularly again and practice proper form, a huge gap in my knowledge despite running cross-country/track and being trained by experienced coaches. I'll have to consult additional sources to verify my form but there were enough descriptions to get started and realize I wasn't running correctly. Like, ""The forward foot moves toward the track in a downward, backward, ‘stroking’ motion (not punching or pounding) and the outer edge of the ball of the foot makes first contact with the track.""Some other parts that stood out to me:-Practice by running across a grass field barefoot-Focus on easy, light, and smooth in that order then fast will come with it.-Your pace is good if you can breath through your nose or hold a conversation.-The natural way to run can be seen by children playing or if a barefoot parent runs out into the street to stop their child.-The introduction of cushioned shoes caused improper form and injury to become more common.-The foot is supposed to pronate.-Top ultra marathoners all adopt the same form"

156,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23506337-kathleen-ninke,Rating 4 out of 5,"Very fun for runners, probably still pretty fun for non-runners!Christopher McDougall, a writer for publications such as Men’s Health and GQ, goes deep into the world of ultrarunners. Figuratively deep as he delves into the world of these superathletes that gain only niche fame and sidelined glory. Literally deep as he explores Mexico’s Copper Canyons and the sparse-living Tarahumara who have somehow–McDougall would like to find out–perfected the art of ultrarunning with seemingly little effort. The journey takes McDougall, and therefore the reader, on a hell of a ride. Throughout, we’re treated to anecdotes about the great long-distance runners of the modern and ancient world, woven expertly with the actual experts on the topic. The whole idea, as McDougall gives away in his title, is to convince us, dear reader, that we humans are in fact born… to... run. And you know what? He totally got me. Look, this was published in 2009, and I don’t have a clue what research or critiques have come out debunking any of McDougall’s ideas, if any. But I’m willing to bet that his basic premise stands: in terms of long-distance running, humans are capable of vastly more than we give ourselves credit for, and often the reasons we “can’t” run are artificially self- or society-taught. It helps that McDougall is a very funny and readable writer. You can tell this guy works in magazines. If you’re looking for running inspiration (as I occasionally am, whether for a half-marathon or a half-hour on the tread), then this might be a good read for you. For anyone else, you might still enjoy the weirdness of the history and science and real-life characters in the ultrarunning world."
157,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/897874-bruce,Rating 3 out of 5,"How to make easy iskiate: put 5 Tbsps of chia seeds in a bottle of Fresca, shake out the gas, and refrigerate. La Chia Fresca esta listo para beber en solamente diez y cinco minutos!If you're wondering why I thought to try this, it's because a friend lent me a copy of Born to Run, annnnd... now my weight's up 3 pounds. Just like the drink, the book’s an odd mix that’s easily consumed, a sort-of mash-up that meanders back and forth between multiple, vaguely-related stories. McDougall’s opening question, “Why do my feet hurt?” is something of a red herring. The author is really asking throughout about the natural limits of human endurance: what motivates and makes long-distance running possible. He does so by contrasting the personal wisdom of podiatrists with that recently published by anthropologists and biomechanical engineers, superficially considering the history and culture of race training, the invention of the sneaker, and the Tarahumara Indians. McDougall uses the Raramuri, a joy-of-jogging tribe indigenous to the Copper Canyons deep in the Mexican Barrancas, as his book’s backdrop, specifically focusing on a 50-mile race that will pit a handful of self-selecting American ultrarunners against native canyon athletes. Organizing the event is a Nemo-like character known to the locals and the author as Caballo Blanco.The following passage from pp. 157-8 neatly encapsulates the entire book:""Stop!""Caballo was talking to all of us, not just Ted. He brought us to an abrupt halt in the middle of a wobbly footbridge over a sewage ditch. ""I need you all to swear a blood oath,"" he said. ""So put up your right hands and repeat after me.""...We shrugged, dropped our packs, and lifted our hands.""If I get hurt, lost, or die,"" Caballo began.""If I get hurt, lost, or die,"" we chanted.""It's my own damn fault.""""It's my own damn fault!""""Uh... amen.""""AMEN!""McDougall works his subject matter inside-out, wandering over and around the drug-running dangers of the high Sierras initially in search of the reclusive Tarahumara, then Caballo, then back in the states to various doctors and trainers in an effort to get his own aching arches into running shape in anticipation of the big cross-cultural, cobbled-together Mexican trail ramble. He takes time out around the middle of the book to recap the 1994 Leadville 100, a century high up in the Rocky Mountains in which select Raramuri participated before getting to the most interesting section (for me), a mini-story about how a few anthropologists working on the margins of their science unraveled an evolutionary mystery: Homo Erectus’ transition into Homo Sapiens by way of sweat, aerobic capacity, and an ability to sustain a smooth 10 kph pace for up to 3 days. (In short, try grabbing some friends and some rocks and going off to annoy your local deer population the next time you’re feeling a bit paleo.)According to the author’s research, the anatomical trick to all this is to let your feet feel the road. Wearing cushiony sneaks and orthotics only lulls us into awkward strides that weaken our muscles and batter our knees, hips, and lower back. Allowing yourself to run forever free as a goofy-toed child builds those same muscles, encourages maintenance of the body’s natural center-of-gravity, and saves overall wear-and-tear. So long as you can avoid dehydration and twisted ankles, you’ll eventually come to outrun a horse (eventually), feel light and energetic, and love your fellow human. Just stop stepping out with your heel, which is, in any case, useless for sprinting and running uphill.So is he right? Hard to say. McDougall presents a cherry-picked and anecdotal case, engaging, but iffy (his barefoot apostle ends the book with trail-weary feet). Meanwhile, McDougall hardly practices what he preaches, undertaking a training regimen to change physical habits that is a lot like his races… he’s miserably slow and requires lots of professional supervision, but he gets there.The author closes out with a fun recap of the informal Mexican race, from the gathering of American participants on the outskirts of El Paso (along with brief flashback biographies of each), through the pre-event festivities, and ultimately through to the anticlimax: Caballo’s post-run origin story confession. The whole is related with sincere compassion and respect, although I personally would have preferred the author’s mystery man remain a cipher as receiving a belated backstory contributed no further insight to the book’s theme or tale.McDougall credits iskiate as a Tarahumara miracle drink that revives and revitalizes the weary. Having now enjoyed it myself, I can’t speak to that aspect per se, but then, I didn’t exactly hit the road to test it properly. It’s certainly exotic, but I note that when push came to shove, even the local racers appeared to stick with water.I suppose this review is a bit lackluster. Part of my problem here is that thanks to the invention of the bicycle, I don’t sufficiently care about whether or not people evolved to jog. Running in rubber slippers is one way to get around. But who needs the hassle? My feelings on the book can probably best be summed up by a recent XKCD comic:UPDATE:Before you drink the barefoot-running Kool Aid, here are two recently published studies on the effects of abrupt transition to a Vibram Five Fingers style of shoe. Runner's World appears to be hedging its bets, but ultimately concludes that, at worst, a prolonged transition period with intervening steps is advisable.Personally, I see no reason to change my model of buying whatever feels comfortable in the store in a low price range... but then, I'm a commuter cyclist, not a distance runner."

If anyone reads this book and comes out of it thinking we as humans aren't meant to run and that running can't be enjoyable, I don't think we read the same book. The title is truly so fitting. Every part about us - mentally, physically, spiritually, everything - was built around running. We have strayed so far, and with such deleterious consequences, and most of us aren't even aware.

When we wear Nikes, we weaken our feet.It's like lifting weights with only circuit machines.

184,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14201634-juliette,Rating 1 out of 5,"Hello, I am Juliette, and I am not a runner. Every spring, I try to shed winter's warm adipose and make myself into a runner, but it never works. I hate every foot pound. I hate my frizzy hair after a run. I hate waking up early. I feel like I’m going to die, just BAM!, fall down and die. Not even the fantasy of Benedict Cumberbatch waiting for me with two scoops of rocky road ice cream and whipped cream helps me to improve my endurance or speed. It is awful. What's more awful: hearing runners talk about how totally awesome running is. They love every pound of their feet. It takes them to a higher plane of existence. Their sweat-slicked bodies have never looked better. They can have Shake Shack without guilt. Their speed rivals Barry Allen's on a good day.This book reinforces all the reasons I hate running. McDougall talks about how beautiful every runner is, how they really, truly understand love-love. On and on and on. You'll never find a sexier man than one who runs 32 miles every day. (Actually, that might be true. But he's going to be exhausted.) Running is meditative. But if all that nirvana talk isn't for you: think of all those hot women waiting at the rest stops to flash their breasts for you! According to McDougall, it happens all the time! Totally awesome, dude. Riiiight.When McDougall isn't talking about how beautiful runners are (not just any runners: ultra-marathoners), he's talking about how evil shoes are for your feet. Forget that all sorts of nasty germs live in the ground. Forget that the African savannah was not covered in New York City grade concrete when early modern humans walked the Earth. McDougall says we're better off barefoot. It got to be pretty blatant, and I was left wondering just how much Vibram FiveFingers paid him for this 280-page manifesto against shoes.Despite the subtitle, I highly doubt that anyone will read this book for anthropological reasons, but there are two non-running issues that bothered me about this book. They’re not McDougall’s main point, but they were egregious enough that they account for why I hated this book.1. As a human being, I find the concept of a “wise and docile native tribe” offensive, as much as the “savage tribesman” idea is offensive. McDougall broadly characterizes the Tarahumara as a passionless people (there is a joke that the men would not touch women, were it not for the nights when they are shitfaced drunk – so much for runners being the only people with an understanding of love, eh?). Presumably, running has cleansed them of human emotions: envy, anger, lust, pride, joy, hope. According to McDougall, their lives are totally absorbed by running and eating healthy foods. It’s as though they have subsumed their passions to their bodies. It’s as though they are childlike.I question that idea, and, worse, I think it’s an insult to the Tarahumara. McDougall is no anthropologist, and he flatly says that the reason he made the trek to the canyons of Mexico was to pick their brains about running, nothing more. He also says that they are a taciturn people because they have been enslaved and murdered by outsiders, infected with diseases by the Jesuits. Perhaps they did not show him their true personalities? Perhaps they did not want to talk to him, some random guy who isn’t really out for their well-being? There is no basis for McDougall’s characterization; nevertheless, it is made firmly enough that the back cover description says this book is about “the blissful Tarahumara Indians.”2. Of course, McDougall’s entire premise is that evolution has fashioned us into runners. We were born to run. Our brains need protein, but nuts weren’t enough, so our bodies adapted to running down prey. Except . . . why jump from nuts to gazelles? We could have gone after small animals, like rodents, or fed on the remains (i.e., bone marrow) of other animals’ prey. McDougall, in his cherry-picking, is silent on that concept. Interestingly, although our bodies are conditioned for meat-eating, McDougall and his non-Tarahumara heroes advocate vegan lifestyles. We evolved to run in order to eat meat to feed our brains. We all must run today to satisfy those evolutionary urges. However, we shouldn’t eat meat anymore because we’ve evolved past that; meat is unnecessary: we should eat nuts and grains now. But keep running. I don’t understand the logic.My friend gave me this book in an effort to convince me that I can be a runner. I feel bad for letting him down, but I'm more of a gatherer than a persistence hunter."

186,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41196455-sebastian-sampallo,Rating 5 out of 5,"Born to Run är en fascinerande bok som i huvudsak handlar om ett mexikanskt urfolk av superlöpare (Tarahumara-folket) som nästan inte har någon kontakt med omvärlden, men är världens bästa löpare. Långdistanslöpning spelar en central roll i deras kultur.Boken är skriven av en journalist som har begett sig till Mexiko för att lära sig Tarahumarerna hemligheter om löpning. Detta kulminerar så småningom till ett lopp mellan Tarahumarerna och ett par av världens bästa ultramaratonlöpare, vilket är fascinerande läsning.Förutom att jag verkligen gillade att läsa om Tarahumar-kulturen och tävlingen mellan Tarahumarerna och ""moderna"" löpare, så bjuder boken på bl.a. på ett antal djupdykningar i löpning (bl.a ett mycket intressant avsnitt om hur människan är ""Born to run"", och att vår förmåga att löpa långa sträckor var en av våra evolutionära fördelar som gjorde att vi överlevde, medan Neandertalarna dog ut). Det finns också en hel del resonemang om såväl barfotalöpning (och varför löpskoindustrin egentligen är dålig för löpare) som löpning generellt. Jag löper en del själv (om än bara en bråkdel av de distanser som de galna ultramaratonlöparna springer i Born to Run), och blev verkligen inspirerad att förbättra min löpning själv. Det finns något sjukt med ultradistanslöpning som lockar mig, och denna bok ökade sannerligen på det intresset. Jag fick också en del tips avseende löpteknik som jag redan har implementerat och som redan verkar ge viss effekt, vilket känns kul (jag har dock inte slängt mina löpskor till förmån för sandaler ännu...) Sammantaget en mycket intressant bok, i synnerhet om man har intresse för löpning (jag tror dock inte att det är ett krav för att man ska gilla boken)."

192,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23299145-mindy-w,Rating 5 out of 5,"SPOILER ALERT:I just ran my first half marathon. I'm 45 years old. I tell my friends that I hate running and in many ways I think I do...but maybe I don't. I've always run alone (off and on, just 3-4 miles) until this past winter training for the half when I connected with a group of my cycling friends who run together and that is where I have found my joy. Running with my friends. They inspire me and help me to keep moving. And they make me move faster than I would if I were by myself. And run farther. I loved the camaraderie in this book among the runners, most who barely knew each other...or came to know each other along the way. I am grateful for the camaraderie of my running and cycling friends. What touched me the most was at the end of the race when the author crossed the finish line after taking 12 hours to do it and Scott came up to him telling him how great he did. He replied frankly ""yeah that he was great at running slow"" and then Scott told him THAT was why he was so proud of him because it took more guts to run a race merely to finish it. Not knowing if you are going to finish but doing it anyway. Jumping into something not even knowing if your body and mind can do it, BUT TRYING IT ANYWAY. I was in tears. I'm a cyclist. Not even a great one. Average at best. But I LOVE IT. I chose to ride The Assault on Mt. Mitchell back in 2012. The highest peak East of the Mississippi River. 102 miles with 11,000+ feet of climbing with most of it being in the last 25 miles of the race. Switchbacks going STRAIGHT up! No relief. The first 75 miles to Marion are mountainous but ""easy"" compared to the last part of this ride. I completed this race in 11 hours 33 minutes, fifth person from last place. On the actual assault at the end, through rain and sleet and hail, sheltering myself in a port-a-potty to avoid the stinging pellets of hail, wading through water up to my shins at a rest stop just to get a drink of Coke which was a ""miracle drug"" for my energy level, hovering in a kind and generous tourist's heated car for five minutes just two miles from the end because I couldn't feel my fingers only to come out at the end to the sun shining and my fiancé and dear friend waiting for me at the finish line with my bag of dry clothes in hand, whisking me to a changing station, handing me my tomato soup and warming blanket and guiding me to the bus to take us back down the mountain. I was miserable but in that moment I was also HAPPY. Happy that I survived it. And instantly I knew I wanted to do it again, much to the shock of my fiancé who has no desire to do it again. What makes me different? What makes all the people in this book different from runners who are happy running three miles in their suburban neighborhood trails? I felt connected to them because of that ""something"" that is in a person that makes them want to push themselves at a physical feat. Survival can be addicting I think. Funny story. Several other cyclists from my area rode this race the year I did and some do so every year. One of them, Eric, is a really good cyclist. His time was 6 hours 21 mins and just as the author stated about the faster runners in his race, Eric could have gone to the start of the ride again and done it over and nearly caught up to me and beat me on a second go-round. We had a special dinner for all the riders the week after we got back home so we could share stories. I told my story about the rain and hail and freezing temperatures and Eric paused and said ""what rain and hail? It was sunny and 70-something. I was sweating my ass off."" I was stunned until I realized that of course he didn't experience those things...because he was way faster than me and was already down the mountain showered with two meals in him by the time I finished. I was irked for a minute at his reaction and then I laughed at myself because I realized I was happier with MY experience. I was happier because I struggled through an experience way harder than his because of my lesser skills...but I SURVIVED and I DID IT. Same ride as him but a completely different ride at the same time. Needless to say, I loved this book. "

196,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40816-christa,Rating 4 out of 5,"At some point in the past five years I stopped interviewing myself in my head when I run. I stopped practicing the words to describe my fictitious comeback, although “comeback” is the wrong word because there isn’t exactly a point of glory to return to. I’ve been a sprinter and a jumper, but the running-running, the distance stuff, has always been a way to train or something that I felt like I was supposed to do if I was me. So many of those miles contained full monologues directed at Sports Illustrated or ESPN. How I coaxed these old bones toward the Olympic lineup. Anyway. I don’t do that anymore. At least, not like that. My new inner interview with the sports rags is all about how the book “Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World has Never Seen” by Christopher McDougall took a woman who vowed to never again run a marathon never-ever-never and made her think: “Hm. Maybe I’m meant to be an ultramarathon runner.” (Translation for people who don’t give a rip about this junk: One time I ran 26.2 miles and said I’d never do it again but now I want to run like 100 miles -- or, like, 30. All because of this damn book with a spine I’ve for so long ignored every time I walked past the bookshelf located outside our bathroom door.)Hi. McDougall’s story starts with the hunt for a mysterious stranger named Caballo Blanco, a man rumored to have a wonderfully dramatic back story -- which is why he’s gone off the grid to live near the Tarahumara, super runners who live in the Copper Canyons in Mexico. The people are known for their ability to effortless cover great distances while wearing negligible footwear. McDougall’s own running injuries have inspired the runner-journalist to investigate what they’re doing right. Blanco’s flight instinct is obvious when McDougall finds him until he realizes the writer might be able to help him, too. He wants to set up an amazing race pitting the best American distance runners against some of the Tarahumara. Boom. Blanco is in luck. McDougall has the connections to help pull this off including a fast-track to Scott Jurek, the best ultra runner in all the land -- and a Proctor-ite who ran at St. Scholastica, so. This story goes on. The cobbling together of a group that includes Jurek, an annoying barefoot loyalist, McDougall and his running coach, and these wild card college students Jenn and Blake who party as hard as they run. (This, incidentally, is how I came to spend half a night investigating Jenn Shelton and ultimately following her on Instagram.) For the race, they travel to the kind of place where if you get lost you might run out of water and end up drinking sledge and getting giardia, best case scenario, but you’ll probably just die. If the dehydration don’t getchya, the drug lords will. In between is McDougall’s case that a) humans are meant to run barefoot or close to it and b) humans were born distance runners who used to chase down their endurance-lacking prey and c) running should be fun and free-feeling and be done for the love of it and not to get something in return, like a finely toned keister. So I love this book. One, I love this kind of literary journalism that takes me somewhere off my own map and teaches me something. I stopped about 100 times to tell my bed partner facts about, for instance, the Achilles Tendon. Two, the biggie, the descriptions of running make me want to run, my hair streaming behind me like a horse’s tail. So I tried it. I tried running for fun and getting into a groove and feeling good and forgetting about distances and time. And during a recent extra long run (for me), I really found the sweet spot at about Mile 5. I had to remind myself to slow down. And then I started imagining my shins caked with mud and the way a beer tastes afterward and that gritty feeling your skin gets when you sweat and sweat and sweat and I thought: “I think I want to run ultramarathons.” And then, as I ran, I interviewed myself about how I came to be an ultramarathon runner.

199,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1142192-cailin-deery,Rating 4 out of 5,"I’ve always thought of running as unassuming, minimal. I ran when I was younger, but never developed the stamina for longer runs (instead was a fairly inadequate sprinter). As an adult, I realized the importance of breathing patterns, tempo, and especially exhalation. That was a game changer, and soon I was achieving longer, unbroken runs. Still, I couldn’t help but hear my mom’s old truism – whether or not it was true – that “you only have so many miles in your knees before you develop problems.” If that was true, any goal I worked towards would inversely develop problems to face down the line. But then, Men’s Health introduced me to a report on ‘the biggest running myth,’ which argued that your knees experience no more damage from running than walking. Sure, the load is about 3 times as much, but your lengthened stride and time spent in the air mean that when you run you experience about a third of contact with the ground anyway. And then there was running form. My cousin was an early proponent of running ‘barefoot’ (essentially anyway) with Vibram’s FiveFingers, originally designed as a deck shoe for water sports. Learning more about running barefoot, I wasn’t sold, but grew to realize it was more about running form than about shoes or lack thereof. A lot of people seem to have rashly climbed aboard that bandwagon without understanding more about their running form, and as a result of injuries they developed, Vibram have put millions into an escrow for anyone who bought a pair after March 2009. Which brings me to Born to Run, in a way. The running form article, you may have noticed, is written by the author. I didn’t recognize the connection until the Vibram controversy blew up and the author became defensive about the fad he supposedly encouraged as a result of one of the book’s chapters.I was in the midst of training for my first Half Marathon and the convergence and contradiction of all these messages I was receiving around something I thought unassuming and minimal brought me nosing around Born to Run. It’s not a history of running, and though it’s become mixed up in the debates around barefoot running, it’s also not particularly provocative. If anything, it brings me back to square one: where running was about simplicity, stamina, minimalism. McDougall focuses on ultramarathoners, who essentially run distances beyond the marathon. He’s less interested in the big events (50, 100 mile road races) and far more in the trail runs with added obstacles (elevation, inclement weather) and the sequestered runs that happen off the books. The runs that happen for nothing more than the sheer joy of running. The center of the book revolves around the Tarahumara; the Native American runners living in the North of Mexico, living and running in the remote and treacherous Copper Canyon (treacherous especially for frequent drug violence). They’ve developed traditions that include running about 200 miles in one session and playing kicking games that last for several days. McDougall works to uncover their stories and bring together a group of extraordinary ultramarathoners – all of whom have incredible stories and have reached immense physical achievements. This was definitely what I needed to get in the right mind set before my own run and dwarf the challenge I had ahead down to a breezy jog."
200,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9567797-brick-eating,Rating 5 out of 5,"“Born to Run” is a book written by Christopher Mcdougall. This book jumps around the main story and many other side stories describing the background of Ultra-running and the science of evolution behind it. It describes the struggle between a star student and his mentor, who was also his professor. The student, David, conducts a study where he ends up figuring out why humans would evolve from a strong, tough, and start hunter (neanderthal), to a weak and skinny homoerectus. Through years of back and forth studying and arguments, David realized that homoerectus evolved into a weaker version of neanderthals to become the best long distance animal in the world. Not “quick fast” but “endurance fast”. We evolved into a runner in order to run down animals until they died from heat exhaustion. There is no physical evidence from thousands of years ago because the animals death looked normal to the human eye. Unlike the neanderthals, who would leave behind hunting tools and arrowheads after their hunts. David concluded that humans were “Born to Run”.What I liked about the book is how the author sets off onto a huge adventure through rugged terrain where many people die, in order to prove his doctors wrong about him not being able to run because “it’s just not for you”. He came in contact with a man who went by the name Cabello Blanco or “white horse”. Cabello was a strange man who seemed to be everywhere at the same time because he had an adulation for running. Cabello became friends with a hidden tribe in the Cooper Canyons through running in and out of their villages time and time again. This Impeccable hidden tribe, the Tarahumara, were possibly the best super athletes and ultra-runners ever to live. This tribe is known to run a marathon a day, commit no crime, and never get injured. The author learns how to run properly with Cabello and finally loses his injuries. Cabello plans a race between the best modern runners in the world against the greatest runners of all time, the Tarahumara. He gathers his best Tarahumara friends and the best ultra-marathoners in the world. The author decides to run in this stringent race to finally prove to himself and the doctors that he can run. This book has affected me in a great way. I also had been getting many injuries through the two seasonal sports I play, Track and Cross Country, much like the author in the book. When this book started educating me on how the more expensive shoes you get the more risk you have of getting an injury, I had open ears. In the book there was a character named Barefoot Ted who believed it was better to run completely and naturally barefoot, or in some cases in a new brand of running “shoes” called Vibram Fivefingers. These vibrams look like toe socks that fit over all your toes. There is no support, gel cushion, and all that jazz people spend hundreds of dollars on. It is simply a thin piece of rubber that is between your foot and the ground. Not long after reading this book, I began running completely barefoot and decided to buy Fivefinger Vibrams. Not only did I realize my body self correcting itself without thinking of doing so, I was also running with perfect form and felt good. This is when I conceded the fact that our ancestors never had these high tech shoes and were better runners than modern generations. People never needed shoes to run, it was all a marketing scheme started by Nike. This book made me aware of our running past and how to fix running for the future."

202,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1132102-steve-schafer,Rating 5 out of 5,"For me, the recipe for kick-ass non-fiction has three ingredients: 1)	It’s well written (duh, but it matters)2)	It is as tough to put down as outstanding fiction3)	It successfully challenges and alters my previous beliefsOne and two are corn-in-Iowa abundant. Three, however, is an infrequent and indulgent treat. I count Born to Run in this camp.McDougall’s premise is that we are literally ‘Born to Run.’ Within this Springsteenesque title, there are really two arguments. The first is what most people know about this book—we are ‘born’ with the perfect running shoes already strapped on, by the gracious hands of evolution. The shoes we lace-up feel nice, but they encourage a heel-first foot-strike, which isn’t how the system is designed to work—hence an amazing 60% of runners get injured every year. So…run barefoot, or at least with minimal heel padding.This alone is insightful, but it is his second argument—and his explanation for why we are born that way—which I found even more fascinating. It is the endurance to ‘run’ great distances that was a key advantage in our evolutionary lineage. Question: Your great-great-etcetera grandfather and an antelope are in a race—who wins? Answer: It depends on the distance. Your kin gets smoked the first few miles, but after that, the antelope’s limitations take hold. The antelope’s respiration is confined to one breath per stride. Furthermore, his body temperature is cooled through panting, which again is limited to once per stride. Bottom line, after 5-10 miles, he is incapable of running. Our bloodline, however, has neither of these limitations. We sweat to cool our bodies and we can adjust our rate of breathing to meet our oxygen needs. In other words, McDougall claims that our ancestors chased down their meals by simply lengthening the chase.It is the gift (and curse) of our modern world that we no longer need to run a third-of-a-marathon to eat. However, the ability to do so is still within our body structure. Coming from a genetic lineage where my father, an avid runner, had both knees replaced, I had come to think of running as a guilty pleasure—something that I liked to do, but was probably bad for my body. I am thankful to McDougall for pleasantly relieving me of my guilt. So, should you go Fred Flintstone today? Not so fast. Your pampered feet have been coddled by shoes your whole life—this is a new way of using them, and all that is attached to them. You’re retraining the system and I can attest to the new demands. After building up to 3 miles 3-4 times per week, I suffered a calf strain. To quote the poet Alanis Morissette, it was ‘rain on my wedding day.’ Too much, too fast is what I chalk it up to. I’ll start again, slower and less frequently, and put McDougall’s theories to test once more. For the moment, they still make a lot of sense, even if just in my head. "
203,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12624339-sharif-mohammad,Rating 5 out of 5,"I've been searching for a hard copy of this book for a while. Finally got my hands onto one in Nepal. Well, it was worth the wait. I've been a fan of books on running since reading Haruki Murakami's 'What I talk about when I talk about running', at the time I thought there wouldn't be any other book that would interest me, the lazy procrastinator of the highest degree to be into running again. This book chronicles about a mysterious native Mexican Indian tribe known as Tarahumara, or more precisely Raramuri in their tongue, the running people who run hundreds of miles for days on end on tough terrains with barely nothing on their feet. Plus we get to know about the ultramarathon scene mostly in US, some gutsy runners and big bad corporate shoe companies namely NIKE. The author seemed hellbent on the idea that modern fancy running shoes what is behind the running injuries nowadays and has sucked out the joy of running what essentially is hardwired into our brains since ancient times as a species. He follows up with some data and research from various experts and elite coaches on the field. However, as a person I remain a bit skeptical as to the accuracy to these claims. More interestingly the author presents running as a survival tool for humans on an evolutionary point of view, how humans are the best distance runners within the mammals and could outrun a deer in packs. He cites some anecdotes of African Kalahari bushmen doing just that, running an antelope to death, a long lost tradition of hunter gatherers. Finally, the most compelling is the heartwarming and also tragic lifestory of Micah True alias Caballo Blanco, the white horse, an American who left his life behind to stay with Raramuri in the Sierra Madre and would go on to manic runs for days. The books centerpiece is about a grand race between the best ultrarunners of the world and Raramuri on the Mexican Sierra, the toughest terrain on the planet. After finishing the book, I.did some research on my own, where I learned the first race which was held in 2003 amongst the Raramuri and from 2007 with the participation of outside world, is still continues to this day. Micah died in 2012 in a hiking accident, the race is now named after him. The runners in the first race, the author himself was a participant, are all still running or coaching to this day. And hopefully the remarkable success of the book will go some way to address the hardships of Raramuri, who shy away from the rest of the world with good reason and make their lives better with their culture still preserved from American consumerism.

Deadlines!I will say, there are a lot of interesting arguments in the book for really learning how to run properly (don't we all think, Hey, just lace up some sneakers and go!) and enjoying it for what it is (it all sounded very zen). For somebody who has always disliked running (except for the one time in my life I was truly in shape, i.e., pre-babies) this was all very inspiring. I want to grab some creepy toe shoes or go barefoot and run like I'm chasing my babies to save them from danger (truly, this was a visual the author gave when describing the proper way to run, and it was helpful. The couple of times I've had to run full speed after the kids, I later thought, How weird that I ran like that, the front of my foot rather than the heel striking down. I felt like a gazelle in my swiftness and grace.)Also just a lot of interesting things that make nonfiction more into a story--the Tarahmara, the setting of Copper Canyons, ultramarathons and the (crazy? but awesome) people that are in this world, science!, the author's own journey in learning how to run. It's been, good grief, about 8 years since this was first published--I wonder how the author is doing with his running. Also I'm giving this to Dad to get his opinion. A long time runner, I'm sure he'll have thoughts! Which I'll trust more than my own. And many, many years from now, when the children are both in school, I'll actually be able to take all of this lovely knowledge and just...run. Or, hey, what's stopping me? The kids are born to run, too. The 17-month-old likes to run through the house yelling, ""Gooooooo! Faaaaaaat!"" (took me a while to realize he was saying, ""Fast!""), so I think we're almost ready!Update: A few days after writing this review, my four-year-old (not almost-five-four-year-old, but seriously-fresh-four-year-old) ran in a one-mile fun run. And I do mean run. I kept thinking she would start walking and I could catch up but she never slowed down enough. So yeah, the kiddos are born to run. "

One side is logical and scientific, quick to extol the awesomeness of the scientific method and the notion of ""better living through science!"" The other side is kind a hippy. She wants to become a vegetarian, eat local, and frolic barefoot (and maybe naked...wait, did I say that out loud?) in meadows.This book appealed to both sides of my nature. It's chuck full of science, presenting a compelling case for the idea that humans are built to run, far but not fast, and barefoot. Yes, I said barefoot. At the same time, it presents an amazingly romantic picture of running. Look, I've been running - okay, fine, jogging slowly - for all of two weeks now, and there is nothing romantic about my running. I sound like I'm dying; I probably look like I'm dying, too. But after reading this book, I have this image of me trotting smoothly through the neighborhood, hair flowing in the wind, joy radiating form my very being.The logical side of me says, ""I can totally buy the fact that humans evolved to run for days across the savannah. But you have flat feet and you're prone to shin splints. You're...thirty-something..."" (even logical me is in denial about how old we are), ""and you want to take up distance running? Barefoot? What the &^%$* is wrong with you?""Romantic me isn't listening; she's running barefoot on a mountain trail. Oh, look! A gurgling brook!Logical me says plaintively, ""Look, you know you can't always trust studies. You need to look up all those studies on barefoot running that the book cites and make sure they're scientific and peer-reviewed.""Romantic me can't come to the phone right now. She's running even faster now, under the light of a full moon.But enough about me and my flights of fancy. I truly enjoyed this book. There's plenty of science for geeky types and enough poetic descriptions of running to appeal to romantics. If neither of those do it for you, you still have the engrossing tales of the quirky characters that run obscenely long distances. I could not put this book down. Perhaps best of all, it's made me want to keep running."
206,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/81242968-hunter-levy,No Rating,"4/5 stars. Born to Run was the first book for the restart of our Idaho book club. I had heard great things from a few people about the book and I've also become quite interested in running myself over the past year and a half, so my expectations were high going in. They were not disappointed. Born to Run synthesizes the story of a remote, mostly unknown tribe in Mexico with the meteoric rise of ultra-running in the west. McDougall is very Krakauerian in the way that he integrates his personal experience and relationship to the subject matter within the story. He succeeds at this and takes the uninitiated reader along with him as he delves into the world of ultra-running, both from a journalistic perspective as well as in an ultra-race himself. A handful of the dietary and logistic practices that McDougall highlights as the reason for the Tarahumara's long distance success are things that I've picked up during my time living in Morocco. The diet of most Americans is so meat heavy that it is difficult to even conceive of the ability to run 20+ miles on a given day. When our diet is shifted it becomes easier to recognize how it is possible that these runners in Mexico do what they do without a second thought. The other stark contrast between our day-to-day lives and theirs is the ease of access we take for granted. We don't think twice about getting in our car to drive the mile down to the grocery store. Running and traversing long-distances is built into the Tarahumara's way of life and therefore becomes something other than simply a form of working out. I've come to believe that the ease of access we have to almost everything in America has become a curse. We've lost the ability to struggle, and with it, the ability to endure and grow from that endurance. It does not surprise me in the slightest that Americans have become obsessed with the idea of running, especially distance running, as it forces our bodies and brains into a state of discomfort that is rarely experienced at any other point in our lives. Maybe we need to shift the way we think about convenience and ease in order to force ourselves into tougher, yet more fulfilling lives. "
207,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"I loved this book! One of the best nonfiction books I've read in a long time. So interesting and covered such a wide array of subjects. It is not just about running, it is about human history and anthropology, brain and body science, different cultures and ways of life. I always love journalistic-style adventure writing (i.e., Krakauer) but this was one of the best I've read and the author did a superb job branching out to keep it interesting but looping back to the main theme and story. And the fascinating, real-life characters were icing on the cake. They were so quirky and fun to read about. Highly recommend!!"
208,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/331623-jamie,Rating 5 out of 5,"Possibly the best book I've read in years. The overall story is of the Tarahumara, the running people, and a 50 mile race in one of the most dangerous places in the world. Interspersed is a history of ultra running and runners. Also included is the evolution of human running, how running affects us, how to love running again, and how we may be the greatest running species on this planet. The best part is the attitudes of the runners, who lift and build each other through triumph and tragedy. It really makes you wonder if running could be a prelude to really changing people for the better.All my life I've ran because it's just what you do if you want to be healthy, and I've always hated it. There is that few seconds when you first take off that it's joyous, but it swiftly deteriorates in pain and drudgery. While reading this book I took note of some of the techniques mentioned. Despite a badly injured ankle I went out and tried some. For the first time in my life I ran approximately a mile and a half with what seemed like no effort at all. I stopped, stretched a bit, and ran back, now breathing a bit harder, but still feeling better about running than I thought was possible. Even now, with blisters all over my toes I want to go out and run. But while I want to learn the physical principles, I also want to take advantage of the mental and spiritual benefits that are described. On the one hand I can't wait to lend this book to all my friends, on the other hand I want to keep it close so I can dive in and recapture the excitement at my leisure. "
209,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/232493-leslie,Rating 5 out of 5,"I saw Christopher McDougall on ""The Daily Show"" soon after this book came out, and I immediately saved it to my to-read list. Almost a year later, I finally get the happy notice from the library that it's my turn to check out this book. It's been a popular one, as my library wait list can attest.This book ranks with the best of Jon Krakauer, and it's a lot funnier (you can only laugh so much when reading about people dying on Everest and the like). McDougall is a great writer with a quick, smooth voice and a real knack for capturing kooky personalities in an honest yet respectful manner. I am not someone who runs (I won't say I'm ""not a runner"" because I'd be going against one of the major messages of the book), but the sections of the book that talk about our evolution as a running species still engaged me. That's not a topic I would have ever expected to enjoy learning about, but I did.The sections covering shenanigans of the running shoe industry are damning. McDougall has a great line about how it seems too easy to blame Nike for the sham of designer running shoes and their central role in running injuries, except you have to because it's basically Nike's fault. The barefoot running movement, which on the surface could be dismissed as a crazy hippie trend, actually has firm roots in science, medicine, culture, and history. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. If you are not someone who runs or cares at all about running, read this book. If you hate to run but do it anyway, read this book. If you run for serious--read it. "
210,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6574202-michael-covington,Rating 5 out of 5,"Just like McDougall, I have some foot problems, problems that have been exacerbated by my mid-life decision to become a runner. Part narrative, part soap-box, this easy-to-read book had me hooked on the idea of barefoot and/or minimus running by the first few chapters. In addition to achilles pain every single morning as I step out of bed, I have found that other leg injuries seem to be popping up quite frequently. Initially I thought this problem was because I needed some ""real"" running shoes and since I live in Colorado a trip to the Boulder Running Co. was in order. They did the whole treadmill analysis and said I had a perfect footfall and did not need any correction, therefore a standard running shoe would work well. I bought the Adidas Pro Glide 4 and thought the wonderful cushiony feeling they provided was just what I needed. Well, now with about 400 miles on those shoes I can tell you my achilles give me more pain than ever. I also struggled to run for more than 5 miles at a time without hitting a wall. After reading Born to Run, I realize it's because I was beating my body into the ground, literally. Turns out, running in these shoes creates bad form (shame on the running shoe industry), so much so that you are forced to run heel-to-toe and to lead with your head out front. Change your posture and run with little to no shoe on and you will find that running becomes so much more enjoyable. I will never go back to running like that, I am hooked and I owe the salvation of my feet and legs to Mr. McDougall. Great read, highly recommend. "
211,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2957848-b,Rating 4 out of 5,"In Born to Run, Christopher McDougall tells a rambling story with passion and heart... and some dubious science thrown in for a good measure.Do you like disjointed stories? Too bad, because McDougall's book jumps from topic-to-topic with frustrating frequency. Wait! Don't go! That might sound annoying (and sometimes it was), but McDougall holds it together. It's like a friend telling a long story over a beer. Sometimes they get side-tracked by context/backstory, but the tale always comes around. The main through line in this narrative is a man known as Caballo Blanco. You see, the impetus of Born to Run came when McDougall was nursing a string of running injuries. He refused to quit the sport, despite doctor recommendations, so he went looking for something revolutionary. That's when he heard about the Tarahumara and their culture of running. Caballo Blanco promised to be the key to getting an introduction to any Tarahumara and the secrets they may have.Along this journey we learn about McDougall's relationship with running, about popular theories on why people run, about evolution, about several ultra-races and the athletes who compete in them, and receive a overview of the Tarahumara themselves. It's all interesting, but you'll be deep into a nail-biting race and then McDougall breaks in the middle with a random chapter on sneakers. DUDE. WHY. But that just goes to show what an engaging story McDougall weaves: I was so invested in that race story I didn't want to be torn away.Back to those sneakers... that's where we get to the dubious science of this book. Though it really only comprises 2 chapters, McDougall does veer into some weird-and-sometimes-contradictory territory on what runners should and should not be doing. He seems to be really into the barefoot running movement, and subscribes to the hypothesis that humans evolved to be able to rundown / exhaust their prey in order to obtain meat. He then also tells us we should all be vegetarians (which, as a vegetarian + some fish my husband catches person myself, didn't offend me at all. It just gave me a bit of whiplash to be told ""we run for meat because meat is life"" and then ""but if you want to be a runner don't eat it""). He also essentially suggests that running can cure every disease ever. It can't, but as someone who also loves running, I assume that wild assertion was written shortly after a run when his brain was shorting out on endorphins (wait, I just Googled it. Make that endocannabinoids).McDougall also got a BIT sexist about poor Ann Trason, because she was allegedly a little rude to the Tarahumara at Leadsville '94. Listen, Trason had been hearing misogynistic bullshit about the Tarahumara for weeks. Was it all fabricated by the odious, fame-seeking Rick Fisher? Yes. But she didn't know that! So she quipped at them ""how does it feel to compete with a woman?"" Big whoop. Let's leave the snide comments aside, eh? You have no idea what it's like to be a female athlete, McDougall. I beg you to sit down.Okay, last complaint and we'll move on. In my opinion, the biggest whoops McDougall makes is talking about how running injuries have skyrocketed in recent years. He tries to suggest that new, fancy running sneakers are to blame. What proof does he have? None, save for the barefoot running preference he has. He completely ignores what seems to me to be the biggest factor: this book was written from 2006 - 2009. Running was exploding in popularity at that time. Could it be that folks were getting injured more often because there were just so many more runners lacing up and heading out for the first time? I started college in 2006 and graduated in 2010. In 2006, very few people were out there running around campus with me. By 2010, I was whipping around runners hitting the pavement with insane strides that surely ended up injuring them. That's the problem, isn't it? People going for runs without paying attention to their stride, their feet, their backs, their breath. But McDougall doesn't even consider that. He's just like ""stupid sneakers go run in nothing lol."" face palmI lied. One last thing: he says regular yoga practice increases injury. No study cited. I'm calling total bullshit on this. Yoga has objectively helped me. Training/recovery needs are individualistic, and this is dangerous. These are missteps, sure, but they appear to me to stem mainly from ignorance, so I forgive him. And I need to forgive him, because, at the end of the day, I really enjoyed this book. Look past these 2 wildly inaccurate chapters and its core message is incredible. It's a message McDougall lost sight of when he started jibbering on about barefoot running and cancer cures, but I took it to heart: running is about fun. It's about finding joy in moving your body, and being curious in your limits and abilities. Feel the sun on your face, the breeze in your hair. Embrace challenge. Running, above all else, should just be about your connection with your body and your mind. That looks different for everyone, which is why folks not only fall in love with different types of running, but also prefer different types of gear/sneakers/weather/elevation/etc. on their runs. And I really, really love that. I also really love many of the people McDougall introduces us to: Scott Jurek, Arnulfo Quimare, Manuel Luna, Caballo Blanco... they all sound like good-hearted people who became connected by a passion that is often enjoyed alone. I do think McDougall takes it a smidge too far when he suggests that being a runner inherently makes you a good person (look at the front few rows of people at any race and tell me they wouldn't punch you in the face if it meant crossing the finish line before you), but I get what he's trying to say: that the people he met on the journey to write this book brim with love and kindness. They deserve to be celebrated. The end of the book brought tears to my eyes, because I wanted to give everyone a big, sweaty, post-run hug. I don't think you have to be a runner to really enjoy this book. This book is more about human experience than anything else. But I would urge folks to take the science-y portions with a grain of salt.

And this is no exception; it is one of those rare finds. I am so glad this was part of my reading requirements. I enjoyed this book so very much. It was entertaining, funny (really, laugh out loud funny), engaging, thought provoking, informative, captivating, and all around amazing. And dare I say educational (I don’t want to turn any one off by using that word.)This book was about so much more than running. I found this book inspirational. I am a former runner and after reading this, I am ready to hit the road again. Seriously. The first half was so entertaining, the last half was equally as entertaining, but a little more scientific. The author explained his own circumstances, his questions and his quest in getting answers. I don’t think I drank all the kool-aid this book had to offer, but it certainly provided food for thought.

Nevertheless, this book has completely changed my approach, renewed my love of the sport, and caused me to completely overhaul my entire running lifestyle.

Human beings, despite conventional wisdom, are running machines. We're supposed to run. Our bodies appear, in fact, to be designed totally around our ability to run incredible distances without fading, without injury, without dropping dead of a heart attack.

I was searching for a book to use as motivation for exercise and after starting and quickly discarding Dean Karnezes' ""50 Marathons in 50 Days"" and Ben Davis' ""Do Life"" (both registering big ""meh""s with me after a few chapters), I was worried that a good running book was going to be hard to find. Luckily, my local library had a copy of Christopher McDougall's ""Born to Run."" After a few pages, I was hooked: McDougall is an outstanding writer and he tells an entertaining and educational tale about near-mythical Tarahumara athletes living deep in Mexico's Copper Canyon. What puts his book into the Must Read category is how he skillfully includes a history of running, information about the science and technology of running shoes and equipment, and an overview of the running barefoot debate. Each of these topics is weaved perfectly into the main story and they never feel tacked on or superfluous. Even though McDougall is a participant in the book's ultimate race (a run of 50 miles in brutal conditions), I loved how he didn't make himself the star of the show -- the people he's taken his journey with are all equally fascinating and he wisely lets their stories guide the narrative. I felt inspired (and more importantly, I didn't feel preached at) to run more. Highly recommended."

Born to Run is an interesting book. It is just interesting for that fact that it takes running from a perspective that is unknown to most of us. The book is about a running event that a pretty mysterious person Caballo wants to organise with the best runners in mankind, including ultra-marathoners and the Tarahumara tribe. This book could have been the dramatic experience in entirety that this event actually was (You really can see the drama that would have taken place during the race and before and after). However, the author doesn't get into what other authors are usually fond of and the race just forms a small part of of the book. The book opens up more into the concept of running, the history of the Tarahumara tribe, the backgrounds of various ultramarathoners, how the human body and running go hand in hand and my favorite topic - running shoes and how Nike (among other shoe manufacturers) may have ruined the running experience for generations.

McDougall is given to hyperbole, his science is sometimes murky, and I don't agree with all of his conclusions, but you must read this book. It starts slowly, but soon becomes a compulsive read. It is about the niche sport of ultrarunning and more about the Tarahumara Indians of northwestern Mexico. I have a small insight into all of this, being an ex-runner (one marathon), a hiker, a physician, and having taken the Los Mochis to Copper Canyon train to Chihuahua in 1976. I also read Carlos Castaneda, like most young people of the 60's & 70's. McDougall's insight into humankind as an evolutionary running machine, persistence hunting, and sports physiology are very interesting as is the indictment of shoes, particularly running shoe's role in lower extremity injuries. He fails to talk much of the beginnings of footware, for example Otzi, the iceman's 5300 yo moccasins. Aside from the science, the story is mostly about people, very interesting, talented, but most of all eccentric people. The setting, the Copper Canyon area, is also remote and mysterious which adds to a wonderful, expectant fascination that pushes you to run to the next page. The journey was a lot of fun. "

The author primarily focuses on the story of the reclusive Tarahumara people in the canyons of Mexico, who are somehow able to run ultramarathons each day without injury. He also interweaves the story of several American ultramarathoners and their journey to a culminating race. Finally, he details the life of a specific American who left the United States to live among the Tarahumara and run for weeks on end as a more content existence.I originally read this book over ten years ago, and my recollection was that it encouraged barefoot / minimalist shoes, which sparked in popularity after its initial publishing. However, in re-reading it, the author somewhat pokes fun at the American character who insists on barefoot running. Instead, he encourages common-sense recommendations, like better nutrition and longer slower mileage. Whether or not you agree with the science (or pseudoscience) component of the book, the stories of the Tarahumara, the American ultramarathoners who raced them, and Caballo Blanco, the American who moves to the canyons of Mexico, were all incredibly inspirational.

And as a lover of running, I have grown tired of the some of these efforts but boy was I wrong. This book is brilliant. The main story line is inspiring, hilarious, and engaging with an absurdly diverse but fascinating set of characters. And the (frequent) plot tangents are just as entertaining as McDougall ponders the history, evolution, physiology, marketing, and (often lost) joy of running. You can't help but be fascinated by the Tarahumara tribe and there approach to life. He raises a ton of questions worth pondering about what we here in Western culture have done to screw up modern running. It's a page turner that I wasn't expecting and I had a hard time deciding whether to keep reading LATE into the night (which I did) or put it down and immediately go for a run (which I also did).

Smile when you are running and think of it as a fun game, not a task that must be completed in order to meet some outer validating goal. 2. Nike ruined most of our feet beginning in the 70's with their strategically supportive athletic shoes. The Tarahumara run barefoot or with light, thin-soled sandals. 3. Don't put shoes on your babies' feet until successful social interactions demand it. The Tarahumara are the fastest, strongest runners in the world and except for occasional sandals they live their lives barefoot. 4. Chia seeds are really good for you. Unlike other seeds, nuts, grains, they are a complete protein all by themselves. 5. Eat like a poor person: corn and beans. 6. How to pronounce Tarahumara ( listened to the audio book).

My running experience is limited to 10K at the Jerusalem Marathon and 45-minute treadmill stints at the gym, but I still found it fascinating to read about the Tarahumara (a Mexican tribe which runs great distances), some of the crazy American ultrarunners who decide to race with the Tarahumara, the running shoe industry, human running and evolutionary biology, etc. If I have one complaint it's that the book lacked coherence. It was kind of all over the place, moving around among its various topics. But that actually didn't bother me greatly. I don't even think you need to be a runner to appreciate this book, although it probably helps. It's always fun to discover light, stimulating non-fiction reads and if you're looking for one, give this a try. "

This book has got me excited to both increase my knowledge and participation in the culture of running. Throughout this excellently written true story the author weaves in information about the spirituality of running, the birth of Nike, running techniques, evolution, persistance hunting and more. I am inspired to become a better runner, a better eater and a better person after reading this book. I hope to be able to challenge myself to experience the following, ""Beyond the very extreme of fatigue and distress, we may find amounts of ease and power we never dreamed ourselves to own; sources of strength never taxed at all because we never push through the obstruction."""
225,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1547480-kathy,Rating 5 out of 5,"McDougall gets it all right in this treatise on long distance running, a sport I have only dabbled in. Even to a non-runner, this book is packed with drama, great true life characters, and well-researched info on human anatomy and physiology as relates to the sport. He accomplishes a fascinating cultural portrayal of the Tarahumara tribes in Mexico, as well as the U.S. ultra-running sub-culture, with a little on African anthropology thrown in to boot. This book is also where the current trendy consumption of chia must have emerged; chia smoothies are a power drink that has been used by the Tarahumara for centuries, he says. McDougall's humor and wit made this story a page turner for me. However, I'll stick to 10K runs as my greatest ambition at this point in my running career!"

McDougall does wax a little too poetic and unrealistically about the benefits of running and of running barefoot (look no further than the lawsuit against Vibram to see what I mean), but it is a fantastic story and makes me want to run run run until running makes me as free as it makes Caballo feel.UPDATE 2019: During an insomniac night before running a half marathon I forgot I had signed up for and thus hadn't actually trained for, I decided to pick up BTR as both an easy, familiar book (an easy one to fall asleep to) and something to help jazz me up for the looming race. Both worked. My initial review remains accurate for me even several years later, so it's nice to get confirmation of some sort of enduring self-through-time, ya know?"

I ran quite a bit in high school but abruptly stopped after uni and reading this has brought that fire back. I’ve recently joined runsoc and am keen for more adventure! Pushing yourself, being with wonderful people and forgetting about everything else in life makes running just so beautiful. Born to run isn’t just about running though. It delves into the lives of the ancient Rarámuri tribe (the running people), caballo blanco (a foreigner who decides to spend the rest of his life with them in the Sierra Madre) and the author, a pretty normal guy who discovers the lost art of running and why it was and is life.“You don’t stop running because you get old.

229,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90345123-emily-waltman,Rating 1 out of 5,"McDougall's book centers on the theory that humans are, well, born to run. That is, we evolved to travel and hunt at a jog, not a walk. He proselytizes a barefoot, vegetarian, ultra-marathoning lifestyle, and disregards the reality that ""for every one [peer-reviewed research] paper on running, there were four-thousand on walking"" (pg. 224) If McDougall's theories are correct, then this book might be worth the effort. Unfortunately, I seriously doubt McDougall's authority. He lost me on page 112, when he confidently yet inaccurately described the John Muir Trail as ""211 miles...across Yosemite National Park."" What else did he get wrong? Besides advocating for a potentially damaging lifestyle, McDougall is also just ramble-y and uninspiring."

I can’t say I’ve found it, but this one is pretty close. Although the title suggests that the book is about running, I would say it is more about an adventure—but then again, running is, seen another way, an adventure.“There's something so universal about that sensation, the way running unites our two most primal impulses: fear and pleasure. We run when we're scared, we run when we're ecstatic, we run away from our problems and run around for a good time.”"

Running for 24 hours straight, however, has never sounded fun in any way.But this book! Is so exciting! And exhilarating! I got so much more than I bargained for in reading this - I really only picked it up because I've seen SO MANY people reading it on the bus or at lunch or during study breaks that I thought there must be something a little interesting about the story.A guy meets a crazy, live-off-the-land-in-the-desert guy who runs all day and drinks beer and eats dried corn and then he meets this guy's heroes - the Tarahumara, an isolated tribe of indigenous people now living in the canyons of Mexico's deserts. I really liked the flashbacks, the descriptions of the runners and the runs they went on, the detailed analysis of the evolution of humans into 'running animals,' and the clan and brotherhood (sisterhood) of ultra elite runners.Unforgettable passages:""You know what kind of nerves are in your feet? The same ones that network into your genitals. Your feet are like a minnow bucket full of sensory neurons, all of them wriggling around in search of sensation. Stimulate those nerves just a little, and the impulse will rocket through your entire nervous system; that's why tickling your feet can overload the switchboard and cause your whole body to spasm.""...""a higher-consciousness cult called Divine Madness, which seeks nirvana through sex parties, extreme trail running, and affordable housecleaning."" (ha!)""'I love to run just to feel the wind in my hair,' she'd say. She could care less about races; she was just hooked on the joy of bustin' out of prison. It wasn't long before she began defusing job stress in advance by jogging the nine miles to the lab each morning. And once she realized that her legs were fresh again by punch-out time, she began running back home again as well. Oh, and what the heck; as long as she was racking up 18 miles a day during the workweek, it was no big deal to unwind on a lazy Saturday with 20 at a pop....or 25....or 30... One Saturday, Ann got up early and ran 20 miles. She relaxed over breakfast, then headed back out for 20 more. She had some plumbing chores around the house, so after finishing run No. 2, she hauled out her toolbox and got to work. By the end of the day, she was pretty pleased with herself; she'd run 40 miles and taken care of a messy job on her own. So as a reward, she treated herself to another 15 miles.  Fifty-five miles in one day. Her friends had to wonder, and worry. Did Ann have an eating disorder? An exercise obsession? Was she fleeing some subconscious Freudian demon by literally running away? 'My friends would tell me I'm not addicted to crack, I'm addicted to endorphins,' Trason would say, and her comeback didn't much put their minds at ease: she liked to tell them that running huge miles in the mountains was 'very romantic.' Gotcha. Grueling, grimy, muddy, bloody, lonely trail-running equals moonlight and champagne.  But yea, Ann insisted, running was romantic; and no, of course her friends didn't get it because they'd never broken through. For them, running was a miserable two miles motivated solely by size 6 jeans: get on the scale, get depressed, get your headphones on, and get it over with. But you can't muscle through a five-hour run that way; you have to relax into it, like easing your body into a hot bath, until it no longer resists the shock and begins to enjoy it.  Relax enough, and your body becomes so familiar with the cradle-rocking rhythm that you almost forget you're moving. And once you break through to that soft, half-levitating flow, that's when the moonlight and champagne show up: 'You have to be in tune with your body, and know when you can push it and when to back off,' Ann would explain. You have to listen closely to the sound of your own breathing; be aware of how much sweat is beading on your back; make sure to treat yourself to cool water and a salty snack and ask yourself, honestly and often, exactly how you feel. What could be more sensual than paying exquisite attention to your own body? Sensual counted as romantic, right?"" ---(this is the most amazing description of long distance running I've ever heard. It takes me at least 4 miles to reach this place, and I can't do it for 20 miles at a time like the woman in this section can, but whoa, this is an awesome piece of writing.)""...was Zapotek a great man who happened to run, or a great man because he ran? Vigil couldn't quite put his finger on it, but his gut kept telling him that there was some kind of connection between the capacity to love and the capacity to love running. The engineering was certainly the same: both depended on loosening your grip on your own desires, putting aside what you wanted and appreciating what you got, being patient and forgiving and undemanding. Sex and speed - haven't they been symbiotic for most of our existence, as intertwined as the strands of our DNA? We wouldn't be alive without love; we wouldn't have survived without running; maybe we shouldn't be surprised that getting better at one could make you better at the other. Look, Vigil was a scientist, not a swami. He hated straying into this Buddha-under-the-lotus-tree stuff, but he wasn't going to ignore it, either. He'd made his bones by finding connections where everyone else saw coincidence, and the more he examined the compassion link, the more intriguing it became. Was it just by chance that the pantheon of dedicated runners also included Abraham Lincoln ('he could beat all the other boys in a footrace"") and Nelson Mandela (a college cross-country standout who, even in prison, continued to run seven miles a day in place in his cell)? """"Posted on the wall of Vigil's office was a magic formula for fast running that....had absolutely nothing to do with running: it was stuff like 'Practice abundance by giving back,' and 'Improve personal relationships,' and 'Show integrity to your value system'...'Eat as though you were a poor person.'...If Deena wanted to think about training under Vigil, she had better be ready to train like the Tarahumara. That meant living lean and building her soul as much as her strength.""'""When I'm out on a long run,' she continued, 'the only thing in life that matters is finishing the run. For once, my brain isn't going blehblehbleh all the time. Everything quiets down, and the only thing going on is pure flow. It's just me and the movement and the motion. That's what I love - just being a barbarian, running through the woods.""''""Humans really are obligatorily required to do aerobic exercise in order to stay healthy, and I think that has deep roots in our evolutionary history...if there's any magic bullet to make human beings healthy, it's to run."" If running shoes never existed, more people would be running. If more people ran, fewer would be dying of degenerative heart disease, sudden cardiac arrest, hypertension, blocked arteries, diabetes, and most other deadly ailments of the Western world. That's a staggering amount of guilt to lay at Nike's feet. But the most remarkable part? Nike already knew it.''Compared with NFL-revering American guys, Tarahumara men are Lilith Fair fans.' (ha!)'Because I was eating lighter and hadn't been laid up once by injury, I was able to run more; because I was running more, I was sleeping great, feeling relaxed, and watching my resting heart rate drop. My personality had even changed: the grouchiness and temper I'd considered part of my Irish-Italian DNA had ebbed so much that my wife remarked, ""Hey if this comes from ultrarunning, I'll tie your shoes for you."" I knew aerobic exercise was a powerful antidepressant, but I hadn't realized it could be so profoundly mood stabilizing and-I hate to use the word - meditative. If you don't have answers to your problems after a four-hour run, you ain't getting them.''Once temperatures climb above 90 degrees F, a few extra pounds of body weight make a huge difference - so much so that to maintain heat balance, a 160-lb runner would lose nearly 3 minutes per mile in a marathon against a 100-lb runner.''After a while, Louis began to look at running to the way other people look at walking; he learned to settle back and let his legs spin in a quick, easy trot, a sort of baseline motion that could last all day and leave him enough reserves to accelerate when necessary.''Know why people run marathons?..because running is rooted in our collective imagination, and our imagination is rooted in running. Language, art, science; space shuttles, Starry Night, intravascular surgery; they all had their roots in our ability to run. Running was the superpower that made us human - which means it's a superpower all humans possess.''There's something really weird about us humans; we're not only really good at endurance running, we're really good at it for a remarkably long time. We're a machine built to run- and the machine never wears out. You don't stop running because you get old...you get old because you stop running.'""'Our greatest talent...also created the monster that could destroy us. Unlike any other organism in history, humans have a mind-body conflict: we have a body built for performance, but a brain that's always looking for efficiency. We live or die by our endurance, but remember: endurance is all about conserving energy, and that's the brain's department. The reason some people use their genetic gift for running and others don't is because the brain is a bargain shopper.''You and I know how good running feels because we've made a habit of it. But lose the habit, and the loudest voice in your ear is your ancient survival instinct urging you to relax....And there's the bitter irony: our fantastic endurance gave our brain the food it needed to grow, and now our brain is undermining our endurance.''If you don't think you were born to run, you're not only denying history. You're denying who you are.'"
247,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38966006-mary-pagones,Rating 1 out of 5,"Not only does this book libel Ann Trason, the legendary ultra runner, but it also spawned a dangerous fad of minimalist shoe-wearing that crippled many runners.It’s also often confusingly written, with hyperbolic and often contradictory claims, and yet, the reviews are glowing? I feel as if I read a different book.The claims this book makes are simply ridiculous. At one point, the author cites something called the Crazy Foot Experiment, where he claims some dude ran for 10 years in the same shoes, with the shoes on the wrong feet: ""For the next ten years, David ran five miles a day, every day. Once he realized he could run comfortably in wrong-footed shoes, he started questioning why he needed running shoes in the first place.""Who the fuck trains like this? 5 miles and only 5 miles a day for 10 years? Seriously? Alex, I'll take things that never fucking happened for $100, please. McDougall uses this anecdote to support the idea that running shoes were created simply to make money by greedy athletic companies like Nike. He claims shoes cause injuries by causing people to strike on their heels versus run on their forefeet, which we are anatomically designed to do, and the subtle adverts for the Vibram 5-fingers (mentioned by name) keep coming. His big piece of evidence is that running injuries went up as the use of modern running shoes did, correlation equated causation.Of course, this is complete nonsense. The fact is, even though anthropologically we may indeed be designed as a species to be born to run, the modern running movement is relatively recent, and the reason running injuries are up is because more people are running--often older, heavier, less anatomically perfect sorts of people who either never would have run in the first place or hung up their spikes as soon as they got their first job out of college.The scenes that really boil my blood are the chronicle of a famous ultramarathon (the Leadville 100 where Trason is depicted racing the (male) Tarahumara competitors. It's said they will never endure the shame of losing to a woman and they call her a witch. McDougall portrays her as just that, the villain of the piece, with no sympathy of what this great woman athlete must have gone through to hone a career as a professional runner in the early 90s and before.McDougall portrays himself at the beginning of the book as a 250-pound crippled runner, and cites throwing away his running shoes as the source of his comeback. Yet he's quiet on how much weight he must have lost, running hundreds of miles in the broiling desert to do research on this book, as well as the fact going from a typical amateur runner's diet and athletic training to grueling professional mileage must have done to get him in better shape. Some of the stuff about why running shoes are bad--that they encourage less fit people to run faster than they should--can be easily addressed by....proper training and slowing down, while still wearing appropriately-fitting shoes.The people I know who loved this book the most aren't runners. Maybe because they buy McDougall's portrayal of all running as a bodily crippling sport unless you embrace the Tarahumara shoeless lifestyle. But there are plenty of people who run, enjoy running, and aren't plagued by horrific injuries. I'm willing to admit that modern life probably has robbed us of some natural foot strength. But the fact is, most of us run on asphalt roads (I do) and spend most of our days in shoes, not huaraches. Saying that every person should run and live like a very small group of people living in a remote, rural area is absurd. Also, throwing away your shoes is no virtue if you aren't injured and they fit you appropriately. I mean, modern digital screens and reading too much probably caused my myopia to some extent, but throwing away my contacts and glasses won't cure my poor eyesight. McDougall creates this idealistic vision of the way modern humans were, and suggests we turn back the clock immediately, with a blind eye to the negatives as well as the positives. It's just as likely people who couldn't run well without running shoes (like me) would have gotten eaten by bears, and only the barefoot-adept survived, but that doesn't make barefoot running superior.Don't even get me started on the diet thing. He praises Natural Man for being a great runner, running down game, but then he also lionizes the vegan, low-protein diet of his ultramarathon runner friends. Eat vegan to be able to run down and kill meat! Okay, Chris."
248,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3843117-ensiform,Rating 5 out of 5,"The author, a sportswriter who runs but finds himself constantly injured, goes to several sports doctors to find the reason why. They tell him the same thing: after a certain age and at a certain weight, running is bad for your body, period. Unsatisfied with this bad news, he seeks answers in other areas, eventually stumbling upon a Mexican desert tribe called the Tarahumara, who run hundreds of miles a week as a daily routine, even into late middle age, and seem to never get injured. This discovery leads to McDougall hearing of a mysterious American called Caballo Blanco who lives among these people and has adopted their ways and diet. Once an article about this man is published, it sparks a new interest in the largely hidden and unknown Tarahumara in several of ultra-marathoning's top figures. Eventually, a race is set up between the bravest of American athletes and the top Tarahumara runners, a race filled with drama and surprises, which no one except the participants and the few townsfolk near the race area ever see.The story is indeed dramatic, but the lily is gilded by the author's style. It is written in a very sensationalist tone: everything is the best, the most nutritious superfood, the most dangerous remote location, the highest town, the most capable humans, the toughest. McDougall is definitely not a just-the-facts type of writer. Every meeting has to be earth shaking, every character has to be larger than life. However, the book has everything, and it has it in copious detail. There is a cast of extremely quirky characters, there is serious medical data on the benefits of running barefoot, there’s criticism of the Nike sneaker industry for deliberately perpetuating bad running, there is the personal journey and breakthrough that the author goes through (along with practical step-by-step plan which the reader can copy to improve his or her running), there is the trove of historical tidbits and fascinating anecdotes about the limits of human endurance, and of course there’s the stars of the show, the Tarahumara themselves and their fascinating way of life and how it makes them such amazing athletes. Plus some American super-athletes. And a lot of data about the benefits of a vegetarian diet. Even evolutionary biology. Quite a lot. And thus we come to the raison d'etre of the book: according to the evidence McDougall cites, humans are evolutionarily created to run. We have the right ligaments, buttocks, and feet to run, and if we don't run, we are destroying ourselves with heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. It's a tall order. But McDougall seems to have interviewed everyone remotely connected with the race, or runs great distances, or the science of running, or the running tribes, and the book is both marvelously entertaining and informative from beginning to end. It gets a little corny and quasi mystical near the end when the race reaches a climax, but chalk that up to a runner's high. I don’t have the knowledge to debate the veracity or debunk or support some of the wilder claims, and the author is prone to depict detailed visuals and conversations for which he was not present. That said, taken at its face value it is a superb book."
249,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39720232-richa,Rating 5 out of 5,"Oh my God! Can't beileve that everyone is NOT talking about this book. If you are an aspiring or a current runner, it is a MUST read. If you are a non-aspiring and non-runner (like me), this book could convert you. Hence, read at your own risk. The author has done a FABULOUS job threading real life lessons in the form of running stories and thrills of several races. I have a newly found respect for anyone who gets joy in running. I missed taking more meticulous notes while reading the book, but here are some key takeaways (in my own words so excuse if something is an interpretation despite my best attempt not to):1. We, as a human race are 'born to run'. We are not pacers (like cheetahs), we are endurance runners. We have the adaptations to be able to breathe and cool our bodies while running, and hence we can run ultra-long distances unlike most other animals. We used to run to get food, survive becoming food, and then run off with our friends and families to set up livelihoods. Somehow over the last few centuries, running stopped becoming a way of life and became a leisure sport but that's not how our bodies are designed.2. Most shoes companies (Nike being at the forefront) are misguiding us by selling us cushioned shoes. Running in cushioned shoes makes the feet weaker as we hit harder and with more impact due to the unnatural cushion from the shoe. The book states a bunch of research and data for how injuries started going up after Nike started making shoes for athletes. And has evidence that Nike is aware of all these shortcomings of their own shoes. Vibram 5 toed shoes could partly solve this problem but the ideal solution is to run barefoot as that's what are feet are designed for.3. 'You don't stop running because you get old. You get old because you stop running' - this is just one of the many many benefits of running. Too many physical and beyond that mental benefits of running brought to life in this book.4. You HAVE TO enjoy when you run, otherwise you're doing it wrong. The Tarahumara tribe (in Mexico) lives this by example as one of the few tribes who's still living, the way we were born to live. Also world's fastest and unbeatable runners when it comes to ultra-running (running 100+ miles) and how!5. The temperament of a true runner/athlete is not fame but to bring everyone along and run together. Demonstrated SO beautifully by Scott Durek's real life examples6. There is a sport called ultra running which involves running 100s of miles on dirt trails, and has seen some of the BEST runners in the world as champions. These champions can beat any Olympic runner in a breeze but cannot care less about Olympics as they do it for the joy of it.."

While this story is unbelievable and educational, eye-opening and insightful (I could go on and on)....my biggest takeaway is that humanity is just so beautiful, and that regardless of differences, when we come together for a cause bigger and more special than ourselves, our differences don’t mean a thing. The last chapter truly left me in tears.Since putting down this book, I’ve been trying to pinpoint what the central theme of this story really is:- Is it about the history of long distance running? Kind of, but not really. - is it the definitive history of the legendary running ability of the Tarahumara/Raramuri, the erstwhile evasive indigenous tribes of the high Sierra? Not entirely- Is it about how shoes and the corporate culture forced on us by brands like Nike that have taken us away from our roots in running? Kind of, but not really.- is it about Caballo Blanco, the mysterious American, whose insane dedication to organize the greatest long distance race ever, who would help the Tarahumaras preserve their culture and running heritage? Again, not really- Is it about the greatest long distance race ever that nobody has heard about in which some of the greatest ever names, like Scott Jurek participated? Not entirely eitherThen what is this book really about? It is amalgamation of all these stories, put together in an infectious writing style, that is at the same time both extremely personal, and distantly observant. I can’t speak to the romanticization in the book - of both long distance running and the Tarahumara lifestyle, as I know such depictions can be frowned upon. But for me, a lifelong ardent avoider (and despiser) of running, this book has inspired me to find the joy in it. And in recommending this book to you, I hope it does the same for you :)"
251,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/136066286-eugene,Rating 2 out of 5,"i've got mostly negative feelings about born to run for a ton of reasons.the main issue stems from the fact that mcdougall can't seem to decide exactly what kind of book he's trying to write. is this book a deep dive into the tarahumara indigenous people? is this a screed against modern running equipment and techniques? is this a recount of the history of modern western endurance running? try as he might to juggle them, mcdougall is unable to cohesively weave together all of these threads in a satisfying manner: you'll be reading about the events preceding the climactic ultramarathon race, and then mcdougall will lurch the narrative to go on a 30-minute tangent about how ackchyually humankind evolved for endurance running.and i mean, i think he's not wrong? there appears to be a decent amount of scientific consensus behind the endurance running hypothesis. but here's the problem: you would never know that based on the paucity of sources and citations in this book. i seem to recall there were literally 3 footnotes in this entire book, and 1 of them was literally just ""nike bad."" mcdougall contaminates anecdotal evidence with ""interviews"" with ""experts"" and what can only be described as fanfic recounts of events he could never have been witness to, enough so that anyone with even a whiff of skepticism in their bones should be rightfully wary of anything he writes.i'm rating this book higher than 1 star in spite of what mcdougall is doing here. the premise, the idea that we've been running wrong all of our lives, is a really resonant topic as someone who has suffered from injuries associated with running. i think there's legitimate truths to be learned from the tarahumara, or the principles outlined by the world's best athletes, but these stories that deserve a sensitive and thorough inspection are being recounted by the literary equivalent of a frat bro yelling at a bar. there's a great quote halfway through about reframing fatigue as a beast that needs to be tamed, and that was dope as hell. for that reason alone, it's a weak 4/10."
252,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73433865-henning,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book centres on the Tarahumara people from the Copper Canyons in Mexico and their amazing ability as long distance runners. The central theme is intertwined with how the author tracks these magnificent runners down, how they came to take part in (and win) multiple iconic ultramarathons in the USA during the 90s and how these events culminated to become ‘the greatest race the world has never seen’ in 2003 where the best Tarahumara runners faced off against the great ultra-marathoner, Scott Jurek, as well as many other great runners from the USA. This portion of the book is interesting, humorous and well-worth the read. The other focus of this book is that humans are inherently designed to run long distances. However, ever since the invention of the modern running shoe we have been unlearning how to run correctly and picked up countless injuries in the process. He delves into details about the correct running technique and how we should all spend more time running. Also very interesting.My favourite part of the book is when the author describes not how, but why the Tarahumara run. To them it is a part of life, a way to connect as a community, an activity that yields pure joy and something which is one with their lives of simplicity. This explains why they are hesitant to race competitively, despite their ability and the opportunity for wealth and fame. Reading this, I couldn’t help but think how complicated running has become. We are obsessed with distance, pace, cadence, which training plan we should follow to get a PB on our next half marathon and how good our runs look on Strava. Along the way we have forgotten the beauty and simplicity of running, despite how naturally it actually comes to us. In fact, this doesn’t apply only to running; perhaps we have convoluted many aspects of our lives and approaching these things with the simplicity and humility of the Tarahumara people would serve us well."
253,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37434264-mark-nelson,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book is really not about anything like described in the title. At its heart, it wants to believe that human beings were naturally evolved to be long distance runners, and the naked human with a naked foot is probably perfectly adapted to it. Everything the modern runner has done in an attempt to improve on that, ranging for running shoes to just about every training technique you can imagine, only takes us farther away from that.Of course, this means we should be full paleo in our diets as well, which is a subtext that kind of accompanies the main thesis through the book.All of this is buttressed with the expected collection of cherry-picked science and anecdote after anecdote. Most are fine but some strain credulity, we do often hear that all cancer, depression, and heart disease is a modern invention, but really, Christopher, it's a little more nuanced than that.And yes, any time you want you can find someone, somewhere, who has managed to publish a paper that advances one your notions, but science generally works by slowly building a consensus, and the ideas in here haven't done that yet.But the book is not without its charms, because the portraits of the many characters and events he uses to illustrate all this are funny, interesting, and of course thought provoking. It all culminates with a crazy race in the Mexican desert, which doesn't really prove anything other than that ultra runners are definitely a different breed.A good read, but I'm not going to go overboard in adopting everything I've read here. It does kind of make me wonder if I should just start running in flats, as I am off the road with a sore knee right now, maybe proving Christopher's point!"
254,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5031179-alisha-kodibagkar,Rating 5 out of 5,"Every chapter of ""Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen"" brings a new surprise. It brings a new view of life to ponder, and shows the world from many different angles. This book unites many different sorts of people by one thing...running. Running is the key to happiness, the reason we are where we are, not to mention very good exercise. Before I read this book, I hated running. Running. Ugh. Ew. Terrible. Why even try? I was content with looking at those moms jogging every morning on my way to school. That was enough running for me. I had come to ""Born to Run"" for something different: I wanted to know the reason for mankind's existence. I craved to understand how we evolved and why we ended being the most powerful animal out there. Instead, I got something even more satisfying.Running is the answer to why. Okay, now don't think that I'm all of a sudden going to be an ultrarunner or anything crazy like that. I still can only run about 1/2 of a mile before dropping down dead. And my technique? Probably twenty times worse than how Christopher McDougall started out. But the real thing I learned was what the Tarahumara, Scott, and Caballo Blanco have in common: passion. They all have that fierce love for running that extends deep into their hearts. I think that passion is what makes you great at what you do. This book taught me about how to live. Now, what does that have to do with my original statement ""running is the answer to why""? It has everything to do with it! Running, like the book says, is supposed to be of the the greatest things you have to stimulate your nerves and make you feel alive. And, our bodies were meant to run. They evolved into killer long distance running machines in order to catch prey and survive. Our bodies were built to run. Now, because of the lifestyle we live, laziness is taking over, and so is cancer and many other diseases that were almost nonexistent before running declined. So, maybe our bodies will evolve into supporting a more sedentary life after a couple hundred generations, but until then, it seems reasonable to embrace the body we were given, and to live a happier and healthier lifestyle according to what we were built for. Running.Of course, I'm just taking words out of Christopher McDougall's mouth. This book, ""Born to Run"" offers so much more than that. This is just what my area of interest leads me to obsess over. The characters, whom I have barely even talked about yet, are by the far the most important and inspiring components of this story. My favorite character is definitely Caballo Blanco. He was born as Micheal Randall Hickman, and worked himself up to almost being a kickboxing champion. He changed his name to Micah True and found love. But then, when his girlfriend left him, he realized that the only real reason he had become one of the best boxers was to impress her, so he left his budding career to live in isolation, and he ran every day. He didn't know how good he was at running until he came back into the real world as one of the best. And then, he met the Tarahumara, a group of Indians that still lived like they used to hundreds of years ago. They lived a simple but happy life, and he fit perfectly among them, deep in canyons somewhere in Mexico, running every day, doing what he loved. The thing I really liked about him wasn't his life story, though. I honestly don't want to live like Caballo Blanco. I liked how he was so passionate about running, and confident in his lifestyle. That's something I want to be, without living in total isolation of course. My favorite part of this story is when Shaggy (Caballo Blanco) is the pacer for the Tarahumara in the original Leadville race, and they try to beat Ann:""Saddle up guys,"" Shaggy said. ""Let's go get the bruja.""Juan and Martimano barely understood anything the guy said, but they caught that all right: Shaggy was calling Ann a witch. They looked closely to see if he was serious, decided he wasn't, and started laughing. This guy was going to be a kick.""Yeah, she's a bruja, but that's cool,"" Shaggy went on. ""We've got stronger mojo. You understand that, mojo? No? Doesn't matter. We're gonna run the bruja down like a deer. Like a venado. Yeah, a venado. Got it? We're gonna run the bruja down like a venado. Poco a poco-little bit at a time.""But the bruja wasn't backing off. By the time she summited Hope Pass for the second time, Ann had widened her lead from four minutes to seven. ""I was heading up Hope Pass, and she just blew by me going the other direction- vroo-o-o-om!"" a Leadville runner named Glen Vaassen later told Runner's World. ""She was cruisin'.""She threaded her way to the bottom of the switchbacks and plunged back through the Arkansas River, fighting to keep from being swept downstream in the waist-deep water. It was 2:31 p.m. when she and Carl arrived back at the Twin Lakes fire station at mile 60. Ann checked in, got her medical clearance, and trudged up the twenty-foot dirt ramp to the trailhead. By the time Shaggy and the Tarahumara, Ann had been gone for twelve minutes.Coincidentally, Ken Chlouber was just arriving at the Twin Lakes aid station heading outbound when Juan and Martimano came through on their return trip. Everyone in the firehouse was buzzing about Ann's record pace and ever-growing lead, but as Ken watched Juan and Martimano exit the firehouse, he was struck by something else: when they hit the dirt ramp, they hit it laughing.""Everybody else walks that hill,"" Chlouber thought, as Juan and Martimano churned up the slope like kids playing in a leaf pile. ""Everybody. And they sure as hell ain't laughin' about it.""I like this part because it brings out everyone's true character. The Tarahumara and Shaggy love running and are passionate as well as lighthearted and happy. Ann is dedicated and fierce. The author's writing technique really got me into this book. He used a narrative hook to get me curious by starting out the first chapter in the middle of his expedition looking for Caballo Blanco so that I would want to find out how in the world he got there and what he was doing, and I was very curious about the back story to why he was searching for the White Horse (Caballo=horse Blanco=white) Overall, this book was amazing, and it's a definite must-read. It really gets you thinking, and even if you aren't a fan of running, this book sucks you right in!"
255,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4618563-wendy-hu,Rating 2 out of 5,"This was a little too all over the place for me. It contained bits that resemble a humorous memoir, much smaller bits of information about the culture of the Tahahumara people and their living conditions in the Copper Canyons, much larger bits of irrelevant biographical information about various ultra-runners, and long tangents about how humans are biologically constructed to be ""born to run"", ultimately making a pretty unsatisfying adventure story.As a new runner, I appreciated the long tangent that described how consumerism and marketing introduced with it running injuries caused by shoes that make us shift our natural running form. There were long spiels about the argument for barefoot running and vegan diets consisting of whole foods. I also enjoyed learning about how humans evolved from its predecessors in various ways to be made for long distance running.However, the interesting learnings didn't seem scientifically sound enough or backed by enough meaningful evidence to be believable. Despite the occasional laugh, this book was quite incoherent and unrewarding to trudge through."
256,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58127285-mia,Rating 4 out of 5,"4 stars - of all the little things we humans so arbitrarily ascribe meaning to (kicking balls around fields, swishing coloured pigment around canvases) running is probably among the most inane - literally putting one foot in front the other a little quicker than normal, getting all sweaty and breathless and it's not even like we have to get anywhere or idk hunt food or something. And that could be just a jog - marathons and, crazily, ultramarathons (that can be up to 200 miles!!) where you push your body literally to the brink of collapse is a whole other ballpark. And one that I've never even really looked into but this book dragged me down an absolute rabbit hole of research and documentaries because it was so super fascinating!! Centred mostly on the Tarahumara, a tribe characterised by their serene disposition and extraordinary running ability but had a lot of tangents - about different athletes and their crazy feats despite often unremarkable backstories, the pseudo claims perpetrated by profit-driven corporations (why is every runner so plagued by injuries nowadays vs before we had all these supposedly high tech trainers, or in places where such gear isn't accessible??), the balance between approaching running as something to scientifically optimise or just for its sheer joy and how to access that - but none of it felt confused or off-topic and came together so well in a central theme that running is actually so entrenched in our history and the very substance of who we are and how we've evolved. Really did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did, and suffice to say has made my half marathon look like a measly stroll!!"
257,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34347084-branton-ego,Rating 5 out of 5,"""Born to Run"" by Chris McDougall is a masterful concoction, blending the robust flavors of cultural immersion with the zesty zest of personal transformation.McDougall, much like a dedicated chef who delves into the depths of ancient recipes, immerses himself into the enigmatic world of the Tarahumara people. His dedication is not merely that of an observer, but of a participant, echoing the ethos of a chef who believes in tasting every ingredient. The Tarahumara, renowned for their extraordinary running prowess, become not just subjects in his narrative but integral components of his own journey.The author's transformation into an ultra-runner is akin to a culinary artist mastering the art of a foreign cuisine. It's not just about the physical endurance, which in itself is a remarkable feat, but the willingness to embrace a culture so profoundly different from his own. McDougall does not simply run alongside the Tarahumara; he runs in their shoes, he breathes their air, he feels their pulse.This book is a symphony of storytelling, where the author's passionate quest mirrors the intricate steps of a ballet dancer. He weaves history, science, and personal anecdotes with the grace of a maestro, creating a narrative that is as thrilling as it is enlightening.In conclusion, ""Born to Run"" is not just a book; it is a culinary feast for the soul, a testament to the power of human spirit and the beauty of embracing the unknown. McDougall, like the finest of chefs, serves us a dish that is rich in flavor, deep in meaning, and utterly unforgettable. Five stars, without a shadow of doubt."

I'm never too sure about the bargains when I start them and this was written in a really cheesy men's mag style, with obvious embellishments, and poetic license. So I looked up the reviews and a lot of them said the writing is really cheesy magazine journalism but stick with it, so I did and it slowly drew me in. It's mostly about a mexican tribe of indiginous natives; the Tarahumara who run long distances as part of their daily lives. They can beat other ultra runners without training and they run string sandals and never get injuries. Mixed into the whole story is a cast of ultra runner characters obsessed with their sport who end up in a race with the natives including Caballo Blanco, a white man who lives and runs with the tribe and the author who like many others, wants to know their secrets. The big takeaway from the book is the spirit of the runners: the best are always smiling, helping other runners; and always running smooth light and easy. And the other big takeaway is apparently most running injuries are caused by big expensive springy runners. And barefoot running or minimal running is the way to go. Which I'm dying to try now. But not this weekend, I'm running my first marathon tomorrow and will keep my runners on for now, but glad I finished this inspiring book just in time. But I will try to be smooth light and easy. "

I loved learning about a new culture like the Tarahumara in Mexico, an indigenous group whose culture revolves around endurance racing. I was fascinated by the biological and anthropological theories about humans being ""born to run."" At first, it seems like humans are predators only because of our intelligence - there's nothing particularly impressive or intimidating about our bodies compared to other species. However, a closer look reveals that our ability to outlast our prey may have made us a dominant predator in ancient times. I was so intrigued by the author's explanation of the unimportance and even danger of good footwear that I immediately went out and ran a mile barefoot. What started off as exciting and natural quickly turned painful, but I'm interested to experiment with it again in the future. Finally, McDougall's first-hand experience in the odd and excentric world of ultramathoners made for a very enjoyable read. "
260,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"""We don't stop running because we get old, we get old because we stop running"".I adored this book. The stories within its pages transcend geographical, cultural and personal divisions. The narrative flows whimsically throughout and its diversions to different explanations and discoveries further enhance its message. What could have become a chaotic structure actually works really well and keeps you engaged as you wonder what will happen next. The Tarahumara are a dignified, peaceful people whose way of life is a lesson to us all. As the book progressed, I found myself rooting for them as they endure hardships as a result of the brutality of life in the Copper Canyons. Their kindness and generosity permeates every chapter and furthers the message that we don't compete to win, but to enjoy the journey."

From the Tarahumara; their traditions and lifestyle to the supper ultra-runners, the new generation of runners known as “Young Guns”, shoes designs and companies, races, overall health (eating habits and exercise) and evolution. Firstly, he makes you feel connected to the sport by evoking all those feelings of running freely, lightly with joy and ease. Like it’s the most natural thing in the world to do.

The purity, authenticity, and overall virtue were mind and life altering. There are great stories of flamboyant personalities along with spiritual, even ritualistic training methods and practices that are absolutely jaw dropping.

But I guess I might try running barefoot, because if they say it can get rid of injuries, it’s worth at least a shot.

But also growing up in Mexico the stories were always embedded with a tinge of discrimination towards indigenous communities.

It is so well written, not only did I want to go for a run every time I listened, I found myself considering becoming an extreme athlete running absurd distances for fun. It was interesting and inspiring and I love how he delved into what really makes ultra athletes successful and arguably states it's their love of their body, nature, and the sport. My favorite line was ""Spirit has to be stored up before a big race."" He was talking about a crazy 50 miler in the desert heat, but doesn't it apply to everything in life? Spirit has to be stored up for the ""big races"" life is gonna hand you as well. "
272,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51575454-mary,Rating 4 out of 5,"The author, an injury-prone runner who writes for sports magazines, takes his readers on a quest to discover the factors that enable ultra-runners, who regularly challenge one another to 100+ mile races over difficult terrain, to succeed. (By the way, in case you're interested in competing, the next 100- mile race in Leadville, CO. is scheduled for Saturday, August 22, 2020.) However off-putting the idea of such a race may be, the book makes a strong argument that we Homo Sapiens were, in fact, structurally designed to run long distances. Although that may well be so, I was not inspired to take up the sport. Three miles on a treadmill does it for me!"

The story of the Tarahumaru and the culture of their lifestyle of ultra-running is absolutely fascinating. If you are a runner, it will make you want to run more. If you aren't a runner, it will make you want to go run barefoot around the block.

There are plenty of words on pages (and by my estimation, too many words) but there are no characters that grow or develop, no central conflict, and no drama. All this book has is some light exposition, paper thin characters that serve as little more than offensive stereotypes (the wise reclusive natives, the blonde beautiful surfer babe) and some preachy one-off chapters of questionable scientific validity on topics like the supremacy of barefoot running. Really can't get on board with this one, and especially wouldn't recommend it to any of my runner friends."

It was a really entertaining read with great characters and storytelling. I know there was some backlash about a lot of people getting injured after it “inspired the barefoot running movement” but I think a lot of that is overblown as it simply talks about how we’ve weakened our feet overtime by big shoe companies selling really expensive, fancy shoes. The majority of modern day characters in the book wear fancy shoes and it’s just the Tarahumara runners (who never started wearing fancy shoes in the first place) who run minimalistic through the story. Great read for runners and non-runners! "

Is it going to be a historical read of a hidden running tribe? Turns out, it’s neither. I’m not really sure how you’d classify it because the author is so tangential. Regardless, it was fun from the beginning and reads mostly like an adventure story until he interrupts it with running facts (which I mostly found interesting, too). Because of this book, I’m looking more closely at my running form and taking barefoot walks to see if it will strengthen my feet and prevent running injuries. While this seems obvious, I now realize that the best ultramarathon runners and runners in general are the most mentally tough. So in the spirit of “it’s all in your head,” I just signed up for my first half marathon in 4 years. Heck, if these people can run 50-100 miles, I can certainly do 13."

These runners are so good in fact that our protagonist a lonesome vagabond Caballo Blanco is on a mission to bring the best American ultradistance runners to their home turf for an ultimate face off.If you're currently in complicated relationship with running, if you're fed up - read this book.

I though to myself that there has to be a better way. We are fit and have never had these sorts of injuries before.

A thing I did not ever think I would be motivated to do again due to the laundry list of injuries suffered training for marathons. Some of the suggestions/ promises in the book are a bit over the top, but it did alter my perception of running enough to want to give it another shot (although I’m probably not quite ready to throw out my running shoes yet). Needless to say, I am very disappointed with Nike and running shoe manufacturers in general! Smh! But I don’t think I’ll be doing ultra-marathons any time soon. "

I finished training for a half marathon and ran my half marathon (a solo venture competing against me, myself and I) listening to this book and today finished a 5k run to finish the book with tears in my eyes. I couldn't care less if it's 100% accurate. The story is beautiful and entertaining. My advice to you: don't get caught up in the facts, just start running to it. By the race at the end, I hope you'll be tearing up as well."

Was given it as a gift and initially rolled my eyes, thinking “ah yes, a running book for a runner.” But I’ll always give any gifted book a chance, and found myself quite into it. Made me think about all the reasons I enjoy running, while offering some new perspective as well. Found the whole barefoot running piece to be fascinating, even if I may not go so far myself...but also, maybe one day? Lots of other great facts and anecdotes, and all imbued with a good sense of humour - made me think I’m reading a Shea Serrano book.I do wonder if non-runners would like it as much, although I’d have to think so based on other Goodreads reviews and it being a NYT best seller previously.

282,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5554671-katee,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5/5 starts, rounded down The book tells of the author’s desire to learn the secrets of the Tarahumara tribe in remote Mexico and how they can run for miles without injury. Through explaining the history of ultra marathons and the different ultras, the author takes us in a journey. The reader learns that running should essentially be free and fun, and that if people don’t enjoy it, they won’t see results internally or externally. I enjoyed the science and psychology presented in the book as well as the majesty and mystique of the characters. Sometimes, the language of the book and the “bro” feel made the story feel like a chore. Otherwise, I enjoyed the story.Also, there are some inaccuracies and exaggerations throughout the story, as well as omissions. Those things make the story difficult to believe and swallow at times. The Tarahumara are a proud people, but the book romanticizes them. What if people don’t like running? Why is running an all or nothing thing? "

Another book about running that I listened to while running. Motivating and affirming. Great cast of real life misfit/outside the box athletes. Love thinking about the power of the mind/body connection. I do wonder how people that hate running or cannot run would feel about this one...this very much seems a “preaching to the choir” book. Also, I found myself thinking about the day-to-day of these ultra long-distance runners. Are they so tired that they have a hard time doing anything the rest of the day? Are they hungry all the time? Does running infiltrate everything they do—from when they go to bed, wake up, who they hang out with etc? Tell me more, tell me more. Except about bare foot running. I’m not on that train. "

292,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Headline: I love this book; you should read it.For a more considered analysis read on...Born To Run is a great book. It's a fantastic story, backed up with a load of fascinating research. If you're at all interested in running or have a slight curiosity why you're not while others inexplicably are, you should get a lot out of this book. I assume this covers pretty much everyone, so.... Read This Book.McDougall has constructed Born To Run very well, effortlessly linking sections ontopics as diverse as evolutionary biology, anthropology, diet, physiology, and a great deal of history about endurance running and runners, with the surprising story of the creation of the ""Mas Locas"" (""Most Crazy"") endurance race in the Mexican Copper Canyons. Thanks in part to a cast of great characters, the story itself is really fun and interesting, and that threads its way through a bunch of eye-opening anecdotes, facts and theories. In particular, McDougall reaches the startling conclusion that, far from running being an unnatural activity that inevitably leads to injury, humans have specifically evolved to be the best long-distance runners on the planet.A lot of the hype around this book has centred on McDougall's argument that modern running shoes cause many of the injuries associated with running, and that going barefoot is a healthier way to run (as it is what we evolved to do). While McDougall's case seems strong - to this layman at least - it is a relatively small component of the book. Indeed McDougall himself uses traditional trainers (Nike Pegasus) during the book (although has since started using minimal or no footwear).McDougall is a magazine journalist, and this shows through at times. Occasionally he builds up a lead-in to the next section a little too much; once or twice the tension he creates is a little artificial; and he may at times grab over enthusiastically for a soundbite. As a review in the Washington Post notes, McDougall sometimes reports incidents as if he were there, when we know he wasn't. I don't think this is to the book's detriment - it's just its style; I found it noticeable, but that's all.I genuinely think that this is a book that could change lives. McDougall takes pains to make running seem accessible; he manages to convey his initial frustration with running (with which many will empathise), but then also communicates the interest which keeps him pursuing it, despite advice from his doctors to give up. He comes across as an ingenuous and incuisitive, and occasionally callow, everyman, and throughout his sheer enthusiasm for his subject shines through. It is a winning mix, which should draw a wide range of readers into his engaging and frequently surprising book.There was one section of Born To Run which really took me by surprise. If you haven't read the book and think you might, I'd suggest reading no more of this review - you will probably enjoy reading it there more than here.Anyway - for those still with me - McDougall covers some theories about the importance of running to the evolution of Homo sapiens. The basic idea is that we evolved for endurance running so that we could hunt animals (which could run faster over short distances, but not over a sufficiently long distance), which he backs up with lots of tantalising and intriguing evidence. So far, so ""okay, interesting"". One of the biologists who conceived this idea, and in lieu of direct evidence, wanted to put it to the test, and tried hunting deer simply by chasing them until they could run no more. The problem he found was that he would lose the deer he was chasing in the herd, where they could rest while another was hunted for a bit. The experiment failed utterly, and the basis of the running theory of human evolution looked shaky. However, based on another person's experience with the Bushmen of the Kalahari, the theory was adapted: the hunters do not just chase, they also track. They pick a particular animal, following its footsteps and other markers, and make sure it is singled out so that it couldn't escape back into the herd.This then implies that the ability to follow a single animal - tracking - would have been entwined with running as an evolutionary advantage; running or tracking on their own would not have been anything like as much benefit. Tracking involves reasoning, time projection, empathy... even imagination; in short, some of the basics of consciousness.That is, to me, such a surprising conclusion that I think it's worth reiterating: the theory posits that the human mind evolved alongside, and in some ways as a direct consequence of, our evolved ability to run.I have no idea whether this theory (clearly over-simplified here) is accepted or discredited or under review in the scientific community (although it is supported by the human brain showing massive development at the same time our bodies seem to have adapted to running).Whichever way, it is a fascinating and surprising hypothesis, and elevates Born To Run from a sporting memoir to something loftier. McDougall goes from discussing his problems with training shoes, to profound thoughts about the origin of the species - literally from the banal to the sublime."

It pumps me up while I listen during my trail jogging and gym sessions and gives me things to think about afterwards to improve. This book was fascinating and hard to believe at times. It follows the epic adventure of the author, which began with the seemingly innocent question posed to a sports medicine doctor, why did his feet hurt after jogging only a few miles? Others ran marathons; why couldn't his body allow it? His questions propelled him to researching elite ultra-marathoners and eventually, he set out to find the Tarahumara Indians of Mexico's treacherous Copper Canyons. This people group are called the Running People and are known to run for hundreds of miles without rest and actually enjoy it. At the climax of this adventure, McDougall, along with a strange, mysterious man named Caballo Blanco who is an American who lives among the tribe, bring some of the fastest American ultra-marathoners and a few of the superathletes of this Indian tribe in an epic fifty-mile race across the dry, sizzling Copper Canyons. An engaging book with commendable research and writing. I could have done without the language (a few cuss words) and the chapter on evolutionary changes from our ""earlier"" running bodies. Otherwise, a solid read that was easy to follow on audiobook. It reminded me of: What I Talk About When I Talk About Running by Haruki Murakami and My Year of Running Dangerously by Tom Foreman"
