0,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma,Rating 4 out of 5,"I’m pretty astounded by how much fun this was. I mean, this may be just me, but “early-to-mid-twentieth century mystery about train crime” doesn’t exactly scream nonstop thrill ride. But here we are!I’m also not sure why it took me so long to write this review (two months, to be exact, so actually not that long for me but still) but again, here we are.I don’t actually really want to say much on this book, which is astounding in its own right because my number one hobby is making up various excuses for me to wax romantic on various subjects and generally listen to myself.But! In this case, that would be bad. Because a lot of the rad-ness of this book is due to the twist, but the Last Thing I Ever Want To Do is spoil this twist for you. Maybe this book will not sound fun because of my saintly consideration of your twist enjoyment, but you should just tuck away in your head that it’s completely cool ok???Let’s discuss the very limited number of things I won’t feel bad about disclosing.For one thing, the way this is constructed is very fun?? It takes you through the thought process of Hercule Poirot (Extremely Cool Belgian Detective - capitalized due to its being his official, government-ordained title) as he analyzes the sitch. So it kind of feels like you’re a detective too, and if that’s not the dream I don’t know what is.If you can look me in the eyes (but please don’t, I’d like to keep these relationships strictly internet-based thanks) and tell me you wouldn’t drop everything immediately in order to become a detective and/or international spy full time, you are not someone I’m interested in knowing thanks.Agatha Christie’s writing style is also really sharp and clean (which I can detect but nevereverever apply to myself, apparently). That’s probably why her books aged so well. This one definitely did, at least.I think some people were rubbed the wrong way (horrific expression my apologies) by the constant discussion of race/nationality as an inherent and generalized part of people’s individual psychology. That would’ve upset me, probably, if it weren’t applied to e v e r y b o d y. Like, if white people got the easy way out, one, what else would be new, and two, that would be the worst ever. Instead, every point of origin mentioned (Africa, England, America, France) is given its own psychoanalytic significance. Which is honestly interesting to read about, if only from a historical standpoint.Are you guys proud of me for how well I remembered this book after two months??? I am visibly prouder of myself for remembering three things about a novel I genuinely enjoyed than most scientists are after major breakthroughs.Which is incredibly on-brand for me.Bottom line: Quick fun historical well-written! I could’ve replaced this whole review with those adjectives and been much more convincing.---------------pre-reviewTHAT WAS AMAZING THAT WAS AMAZING THAT WAS AMAZING!(I hope you read that in Aziz Ansari's voice.

1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,Rating 4 out of 5,"Murder on the Orient Express is arguably Agatha Christie's most famous Poirot story, and for good reason.Our Belgian detective is aboard the fabled Orient Express when a snowstorm stops the train on its tracks. When morning comes, it is discovered that a passenger has been stabbed to death in his locked compartment. With the snow outside, it becomes clear that the murderer must still be on the train, and it is up to Poirot to figure out who it is.This is my favorite type of murder mystery—a locked room. The suspects have nowhere to go and the guilty party must be one of them. What follows is a brilliantly twisty whodunnit with red herrings and interesting characters who all have something to hide. And when the solution is revealed, I'm blown away by the cleverness and how the clues were there all along. The only quibble I have is that Poirot goes and interviews each person one by one, which is then recorded in detail. This format is pretty common in quite a few Poirot books, but it isn't my preferred style. It can get boring and repetitive to hear each person describe the same event with just a slightly different spin. But that's usually over soon enough, and then we can get back to the exciting parts.I first started reading Agatha Christie in 8th grade, partly to learn English and partly because my younger self found murders fascinating. Thus began my love affair with Agatha Christie and she remains one of my favorite authors of all time. Often books we enjoy in our childhood do not hold up to rereadings as an adult, but this one sure does.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:Death on the Nile~~~~~~~~~~~~"

I was not expecting that ending, which is obviously a good thing in a murder mystery story, but I am proud of myself for picking up on some other clues. I am so impressed by how she was able to weave this intricate of a story in only 200 pages and I can't wait to pick up another one of her novels in the future!"
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365405-james,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 stars to Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express. I chose to read this Christie spectacular after finishing ""And There Were None."" She's such a treasure - never disappoints.A train. A murder. Multiple suspects. Nearly an alibi for everyone. But wait, there's a motive for everyone. How did this seemingly impossible murder occur? Hercule Poirot knows.Well, I'm glad he did because I was stumped! But with good reason as this plot twist will have your knickers locked down (and not just in a bunch!).The plot is just too delicious. The characters are just fascinating. No modern day electronics. No ability to research anything other than by asking questions. And Christie wrote this nearly 100 years ago. That's why it's a 5 for me -- it's pure good storytelling without anything in the way."
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48328025-megs-bookrack,Rating 5 out of 5,"Murder on the Orient Express is one of Agatha Christie's most well-known and beloved works. Adapted numerous times for radio, film and television, in addition to inspiring countless writers and filmmakers, most people have at least a cursory understanding of what this story entails.A classic whodunit, with Christie's signature-styling, this is one of the stories that sealed my fate as a Reader.I adore Hercule Poirot and grew up binging Christie's works. I read this book as a child, and of course, have watched a couple of the movie adaptations. In spite of that, I still had a rollicking good time reading this again. There is something so satisfying about the ending of this one. I could never dream up a better conclusion. I think if you are looking to get into Christie's books, this is an excellent starting point as I feel it is a perfect example of her method!Highly recommend!"

Am I the only one? I can't be the only one, can I?2016If you've never read one of her books, this one sums up the Agatha Christie experience quite nicely.As in: a lot of her mysteries are unsolvable.Don't bother trying, because it will only infuriate you when you find out that the answer to the whodunnit is something far-fetched & entirely unbelievable.Roll with it, I say! Just trust that the little Belgian detective will eventually make everything all right, and settle in for a cute (albeit old-timey) mystery.I'm not gonna bore you with a plot synopsis, but if you're a fan of stories that take place on trains, child killers getting shanked, and plenty of stereotypes thrown in for good measure...then this is the book for you!

Just change your plans. That is all.I'd like to know if anyone has ever solved this particular murder mystery. It's mind-boggling, and deservedly one of Agatha Christie's better-known books."

10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30268418-tina-haigler,Rating 5 out of 5,"Well, ladies and gentlemen, that was fantastic! I mean, what can I say? Agatha Christie was a genius. So is David Suchet who narrated the audiobook (and played Poirot in the TV show).This story is set on a filled to capacity train, heading from Stamboul (Istanbul) to London. It's the middle of winter and the snow has built up on the tracks and forced the train to a standstill on its way through Yugoslavia (an area that is now in Croatia). This is when the murder is discovered, which luckily for me (I can be impatient) happens within the first 50 pages.There are so many characters in this. It was a little difficult to keep them all straight but Suchet's voices helped. Let's start with the characters who aren't suspects. We have, naturally, Hercule Poirot, detective extraordinaire, Monsieur Bouc, the Wagon-Lits director, and Poirot's old friend, Dr. Constantine, a doctor on the train, Pierre Michel, the conductor of the Stamboul-Calais coach, and Ratchett, the victim. Bouc is the one more quick to jump to conclusions whereas Poirot is very methodical and waits till he has all the information and all the clues fit before committing to the assignment of guilt. Now for the possible murderers. Of course, all of the passengers on the train are suspects. We have Hector MacQueen, Ratchett's secretary, Edward Masterman, Ratchett's valet, Mrs. Hubbard, Greta Ohlsson, Princess Dragamiroff and her maid, Hildegarde Schmidt, the Count and Countess Andrenyi, Colonel Arbuthnot, Mr. Hardman, Antonio Foscarelli, and Mary Debenham. There are lots of interviews, collecting of evidence, and taking notes. I liked how Poirot, Bouc, and Dr. Constantine kept going over the evidence with each other. The repetition of the clues helped me keep track of all of them. With so many suspects the evidence kept going in circles and making my head spin. I had a few theories but for the first time ever one of them was right! I didn't know why I was right until Poirot started to piece things together but once he did the answer was quite clear. I felt like the conclusion was the proper way to end the story as well.Agatha Christie never fails to impress me with her ingenuity. I plan on reading many more of her novels in the near future. As Poirot would say, I pray you, join me."
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43377498-hannah-greendale-hello-bookworm,Rating 3 out of 5,"A train stopped at midnight in the snow. A dead body found in a compartment. Twelve stab wounds leave no doubt it was murder. And Hercule Poirot, tasked with solving the crime, is certain the culprit is a passenger on the Orient Express. The first clue that Murder on the Orient express will be a laborious read arrives shortly after the murder victim is discovered. Among the clues is a scrap of paper which reads 
 “– member little Daisy Armstrong.”
 From this clue, Poirot leaps to an illogical conclusion that serves as the foundation for the remainder of the book. The message on the scrap of paper leads Poirot to assert that the murder victim is a man named Cassetti who is wanted for the murder of an innocent girl named Daisy Armstrong. This connection makes about as much sense as finding a scrap of paper that reads, “– member Ms. J.K. Rowling” and assuming the person it belonged to is the long-lost fourth child of the world-renowned author. Poirot makes the connection between the scrap of paper and the murder victim with unbearable convenience. Equally baffling is Poirot’s assertion that the murderer could not have exited through the open train window because there are no footprints in the snow. Is it so unfathomable that the murderer might have gone out the window and sidled along the train or even climbed atop it? Such oversights leave readers to wonder if Christie intends to misdirect her audience or if her leading man isn’t as bright as he first appears. Poirot dismisses probable explanations, clings to his illogical assumption about the murder victim, and proceeds to investigate the crime by interviewing every passenger on the train in a designated room. He regales each passenger with his outlandish conclusion, stating it as stone-cold fact, and observes their reactions. Reading through the same set of questions over and over again is a wearisome act, one that grows more tiresome when one remembers that characters could very well be lying, making the entire exercise feel like wasted time. When this repetitive process finally concludes, Poirot then interviews every passenger again while digging through their luggage in their individual compartments. Couldn’t he have interviewed them in their compartments to begin with? Was it necessary to drag out this process? After Poirot completes his lengthy interview process, he regales his audience with the solution to the mystery. Those hoping to solve the case themselves will be sorely disappointed, as Poirot’s ability to pinpoint the murderer is dependent on information that’s unavailable to the reader, and the answer to who stabbed the victim borders on absurd. However, despite the improbability of the reveal, Christie’s book leaves a lasting impression because of the uncomfortable questions it raises about justice. Murder on the Orient Express is a tedious read that reaches an unlikely, albeit unexpected, conclusion – one that lingers because of its themes."

F.U.N!!!
I actually enjoyed reading this so much I constantly found myself giggling with delight! *lol* I swear there’s nothing better than a mystery or a puzzle you need to solve and I guess in this particular case it might have even been both! ;-PThere were so many hints and inconsistencies that my head was literally spinning but being the curious person I am, I still tried my very best to be perceptive and to collect all those little treats. XD By the end of the book I felt like a squirrel, gathering all the pieces until I was finally able to make sense of them! *lol* And somehow, I don’t even know how, I actually did it!!! ;-PMaybe to watch eight seasons of “Castle” and all the Sherlock Holmes series and movies eventually paid off? Who knows!? *LOL* All I know is that I solved the mystery and I’m so damn happy I’m still grinning and laughing like crazy!!!24 hours after finishing the book! XD”Bughouse – that’s what this business is – bughouse!”Yes, I couldn’t agree more and since I don’t want to spoil anyone who still wants to read the book, I’ll write down my thoughts in this nice and tiny spoiler section! *lol* Detectives you’ve been warned! ;-PThe solution and ending:”If so and so is lying, on what point are they lying and what is the reason for the lie?”I don’t even know how often I asked myself this question throughout the entire book, it must have been pretty often though! *lol* I was always certain that it was more than one person who killed Ratchett and at some point I suspected everyone to be the murderer. XD Even the doctor and the conductor! Haha! And I think it was exactly that moment when I finally realised that I was right, because as soon as I thought it, I instantly latched onto the conductors testimony and from there on everything fell into place. ;-) I knew he must have lied and therefore been involved in the crime and then I thought about all those little hints I collected so carefully. The weapon in the spongebag, the mention of the actress, the door that was open, the incriminating pipe cleaner, the familiarity between Colonel Arbuthnot and Mary Debenham, the number of wounds on the victim and especially the remarkable difference of those mentioned stab wounds, … the list could go on and on! *lol* Once I made the connection with the Princess, it wasn’t all too hard to figure who the Countess was and after analysing every character that was on the train I came to the same conclusion as Poirot! ;-) Sure, there were some clues and hints I didn’t get, but in the end it seems like I was able to find the most important ones. XD I think the only thing I didn’t like was the ending. >_< It was rather abrupt and the righteous woman in me wasn’t okay with the way things were handled. I mean yes, it seems like Ratchett was a monster and they all had a very good reason to end his life. (Some more than others…) I don’t like the idea that they were let off the hook so easily though. I mean it was murder after all! There should have been a consequence. If everyone would take the law into their hands our society would fall into pieces! There’s a reason we have laws and courts. Well, that’s just my subjective opinion though. I know some people will say it’s just a book and that’s okay with me! ;-) I just felt a need to point it out because it really left a bad taste in my mouth. XD Guess that’s the superhero in me speaking. *lol*All things considered I really enjoyed “Murder on the Orient Express” and I can easily recommend it to everyone who loves to get their mind into a knot! *lol* This book most certainly will keep you on your toes! Be careful not to slip! ;-P"
13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2933855-brina,Rating 5 out of 5,"2023: My daughter discovered Agatha Christie this year. I’d like to say that she is following in my footsteps. We have read a lot of the same mysteries this year and enjoyed bouncing ideas off of each other. When I mentioned that my junior high teacher introduced me to Agatha Christie at the same age she is now, she agreed to finally read my favorite one of them all. It is this case, what I call Christie’s opus that got things started for me back in seventh grade, and I am thrilled to be passing my love for that famous Belgian detective onto my daughter. A bonus is that I caught intricacies this time around, but it’s only been five times. One of these times I might actually solve a case before Hercule Poirot, or maybe I won’t or he wouldn’t be Hercule Poirot. 2019: It is three days before Chanukah break and my house will be full. Thankfully, even if it’s for four and a half days, all my kids are off at the same time. That 875 page Pulitzer winner, as much as I’d love to read it, admittedly is not going to happen. Between cleaning and guests and the football team that graces my avatar here, I do not have much “brain power” left for anything that requires higher level thinking. A favorite author Anna Quindlen notes that reading leads to rereading leads to writing, and the librarian at check out told me that there is nothing wrong with rereading a book if it’s a choice between that or not reading at all. Mysteries have long been my preferred palette cleanser of choice in between denser reads. A quick whodunit allows me to think without thinking too much, especially if the author follows a formula. In this hectic time I decided to turn my ultimate comfort reading author, the Queen of Crime, Dame Agatha Christie. According to my edition of Murder on the Orient Express, Agatha Christie has been published more than all but two books in history, Shakespeare and the Bible. She first introduced her famous Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot in the 1920s in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd and added Miss Jane Marple to the world in the 1930s. I have been reading Poirot cases or watching the David Suchet television shows for years. Christie’s books are from nearly one hundred years ago and are harmless enough to allow middle school children to read. I first exposed my oldest daughter to Poirot two years ago and she admits that Christie is the easiest classic to follow. My first taste of Poirot was in seventh grade language arts class when I read Murder on the Orient Express for the first time. Written in 1934, it is the standard barer for all of Poirot’s cases and has been adapted to the big screen twice. Knowing the outcome reading for a third time allowed me to look at the intricacies of the case rather than focusing on whodunit, making this reading all the more enjoyable. Hercule Poirot is traveling through the Bosporus when a telegram from London recalls him. The Belgian detective encounters an acquaintance Monsieur Bouc in an Istanbul hotel lobby who assists him in securing passage on the fabled Orient Express. Although it is the winter, all sixteen compartments on the train are booked, yet Bouc insures Poirot a spot on the trip. As with other cases, detecting seems to find Poirot wherever he is, whether it is vacationing on a beach or visiting a friend in a rural village. Somehow a murder just has to happen when Poirot is present, as though the murderer is trying to outsmart the Belgian sleuth, stating “come find me, tell me how you know what just occurred.” Of course, within the first twenty four hours of the full Orient Express trip through Europe, a man is murdered. Even more conveniently, the train runs into a snow drift and is stalled so the murderer has no way of escaping. Monsieur Bouc enlists Poirot’s help in solving the case, and he uses his little gray cells to outsmart both his assistants and the perpetrators of this crime. Because I know who murdered Mr Ratchett, I focused instead on the little details from Poirot’s body language to how he detected of each of passengers was telling the truth or not. At the scene of the crime, a note stated “remember Daisy Armstrong.” Poirot fills us in that this had been a horrendous case of kidnapping and murdering a baby, starting a ripple effect in which the rest of the family died. Anyone associated with the family was heartbroken, and the victim on the train is none other than the Armstrong murderer under an assumed name. Poirot figured this out immediately and began to piece together who could be associated with the crime based on the characters of all stripes who happened to be on the train with him. I have always been most intrigued with the actress Linda Arden and the H on a handkerchief that Poirot figures out the identity of the owner steps before anyone else. Even those who work with him are amazed at how he determines who did what, often stopping him during explanations to say, “this cannot be true.” Alas, as Poirot would say, it is true mon cher, and that is why he has been the world’s most famous detective for decades. Dame Agatha Christie paved the way for generations of crime writers, who admit to admiring her work. In many cases Christie purposely leaves out a clue until the end so that her readers would have to read the entire case guessing whodunit. This usually takes place more with Miss Marple, but Poirot has had his experience withholding evidence as well. Usually the cases leave me baffled and when I read for the first time years ago, the ending here left me scratching my head. Now, I can envision the end to the 1970s version of the movie and say aha, Poirot is absolutely correct. Even when the Queen of Crime deliberately leaves out a clue, her mysteries rank among my all time favorites. Both Poirot and Miss Marple allow me to use my little gray cells without overthinking in between denser reads. Murder on the Orient Express ranks as one of my all time favorites and is always a pleasure to revisit, especially during the more hectic times in my life. 5 stars"

I have the complete blu-ray box set and love this series so much! And now I get start on one of the books! =) ♥The wonderful Hercule Poirot can not ever go on any holidays without someone being murdered. But, never-the-less he will figure it out. And a murder has taken place upon the Orient Express. The man murdered in named Ratchett, but we find out later on in the story this is an alias. Poirot has simply uncovered that the murderer is on the train - not escaped out the window into the snow they are trapped in as the murderer would want us to believe. Poirot interviews all of the passengers, makes a list and the little grey cells start to formulate. Ten QuestionsOn the paper was written:Things needing explanation1. The handkerchief marked with the initial H. Whose is it? 2. The pipe cleaner. Was it dropped by Colonel Arbuthnot? Or by someone else?3. Who wore the scarlet kimono?4. Who was the man or woman masquerading in Wagon Lit uniform?5. Why do the hands of the watch point to 1:15?6. Was the murder committed at that time?7. Was it earlier?8. Was it later?9. Can we be sure that Ratchett was stabbed by more than one person?10. What other explanation of his wounds can there be?Now, I have already seen all of the shows and movies so I know what happened and I think the ending is bloody brilliant!

Because of this I will be brief so you can never go back and say, ""I would have loved this book, but that Matthew guy from Goodreads ruined it for me!"" So, here is my quick but hopefully useful review.This is a classic mystery. You like mysteries? You have to have to read this! Characters are great! So much fun meeting and learning about them all.Current mysteries have nothing on Christie. This is very intricate and very fun to watch the clues be put together and the solution come into focus. But, now I am getting too close to spoilers.Read it! It's good!"

He instructs the concierge to book him a first-class compartment on the Simplon-route Orient Express service leaving that night. Although the train is fully booked, Poirot obtains a second-class berth through the intervention of friend, fellow Belgian, and passenger Monsieur Bouc, director of the Compagnie Internationale from Wagons-Lits railway. Other passengers include Dr. Constantine; governess Mary Debenham; Mrs. Hubbard; Princess Dragomiroff and her maid Hildegarde Schmidt; Greta Ohlsson; vulgar American businessman Ratchett as well as his secretary and translator, Hector McQueen, and valet Edward Henry Masterman; Count and Countess Andrenyi; Antonio Foscarelli; and the conductor Pierre Michel.Ratchett recognizes Poirot and asks for his protection as Ratchett has been receiving death threats. Poirot, repulsed by Ratchett, refuses the case. M. Bouc has taken the last first-class cabin, but arranges to be moved to a separate coach and gives Poirot his space. The first night, Poirot observes some strange occurrences. Early in the morning, he is awakened by a cry from Ratchett's compartment next door. Michel knocks on Ratchett's door, but a voice from inside responds, ""Ce n'est rien. Je me suis trompé"" (It is nothing. I was mistaken). Mrs. Hubbard rings her bell and tells the conductor there is a man in her room. When Poirot rings his bell for water, Michel informs him that the train is stuck in a snowbank between Vinkovci and Brod before he hears a loud thump next door.The next morning, with the train still stopped, M. Bouc informs Poirot that Ratchett has been murdered and the murderer is still aboard. Poirot takes up the case. With Dr. Constantine's help, he examines Ratchett's body and compartment, discovering the following: the body has 12 stab wounds, the window had been left open, a handkerchief with the initial ""H"", a pipe cleaner, a flat match different from the ones Ratchett used, and a charred piece of paper with the name ""Armstrong"" on it.The piece of paper helps Poirot work out who Ratchett really is and his murderer's motive. A few years earlier, a man named Cassetti kidnapped three-year-old Daisy Armstrong. Cassetti collected a ransom from the wealthy Armstrong family, but killed the child within two hours of kidnapping her. Poirot concludes that ""Ratchett"" was actually Cassetti. The voice in Ratchett's compartment could not have been the American's, since Ratchett does not speak French.Poirot begins interviewing everyone on the train and discovers McQueen is directly involved as he knows about the Armstrong note and believed it was destroyed and that Mrs. Hubbard believes the murderer was in her cabin. While the other passengers provide suitable alibis, Poirot notes they all observed a woman in a red kimono walking down the hallway on the night of the murder, though no one admits to owning a red kimono, Mrs. Hubbard had Ohlsson lock the communicating door between her compartment and Ratchett's, and Schmidt bumped into a stranger wearing a Wagons-Lits uniform. While inspecting the passengers' luggage, Poirot is surprised to find the label on Countess Andrenyi's luggage is wet, Schmidt's bag contains the uniform in question, and his own luggage contains the red kimono.Characters: Hercule Poirot, Samuel Edward Ratchett, Hector MacQueen, Masterman, Colonel Arbuthnot, Harriet Hubbard, Count Rudolf Andrenyi, Countess Elena Andrenyi, Princess Natalia Dragomiroff, Mary Debenham, Hildegarde Schmidt, Antonio Foscarel, Greta Ohlsson, Pierre Michel, Cyrus Hardman, Dr. Constantine, M.

Best thing about those days not having a crush on boy bands, having ridiculous style, worst music taste, winning boys at the soccer games. It was coming to home from a long school day, devouring too much sweet pastries which could help you climb at the roof and dance all night, taking my books and locking myself to my room with them. At those days I discovered Agatha Christie books and my mean spirit. I read them at nights, appeared at the school with my vampirella image to lose the rest of my chances to attract any boy (don’t worry, I’d already lost it after kicked most of their asses! They had been already running away from me to cry to their moms.)I read them at the school times, during classes and bribed my teachers with my amazing thriller collections to get better grades. Guess what! I became valedictorian!But some of my friends and my family members started to steal my books so as a precaution I started to write the killer’s name in the middle of the book and I left the books those places they could have been easily snatched! (They thought they were so smart!)It was painful experience to find your favorite Christie novel. I always chose Hercule Poirot over Miss. Marple. But some books were also deliciously thrilling and they truly gave me so much fun without those expert detectives! As my favorite book I always tried to choose between “Murder of Roger Ackroyd” , “And then there were none”, “Murder on the Orient Express”, “Five Little Pigs” and “Death on the Nile”Now after watching the remake of “Murder on the Orient Express” (I highly recommend you to watch 1974 version of the movie adaptation with brilliant Hercule Poirot composition of Albert Finney. He created a more reliable version of Belgian detective! I have been never being a great fan of Peter Ustinov’s or Kenneth Branagh’s versions even though they are one of the greatest actors) and I decided to reread some Christie books to decide which one is my favorite. (At least I wasn’t drunk when I made my decision like the time I decided to reread Twilight and as a result I was saved to performed hara-kiri to myself.)So the famous detective finds himself on the Orient Express with a killer on board because an rich American named Ratchett was stabbed 12 times! Their train is stopped by the snow storm. This is a complex, challenging, one of the most different cases of Mr. Poirot because any one can have a motive to kill Ratchett who lied about his criminal identity.I remember that I changed my mind at least dozen times when I read this book at the first time. I am not going to advocate myself by saying I was too young, naïve and living without my spidey spider senses! But guess what, if I read this book at the first time RIGHT NOW, I cannot find whodunit again! So there’s no progression about my grey cells’ functioning capacity, sorry Mr. Poirot, I had eat more hard boiled eggs and stop watching Bachelor episodes which kill the rest of my remaining ones.This was incredibly captivating, mysterious, smart, exciting book. I think it is my first choice of Christie books and I love to read over and over again! I’m not gonna give spoilers or send you hard copy of it( I cannot guarantee I can help myself not to write murderer’s name in the middle. Old habits die hard) So please if you didn’t watch one of the movies or you didn’t read any other Christie books, pick this one, enjoy it and send me Sprinkles cupcakes (at least a dozen) as an appreciation gesture."
18,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10171516-jessica,Rating 3 out of 5,"i cant even begin to tell you how much it bothers me that i had the audacity to start a series with book 10… but ive heard each book can be read as a standalone and this is the most popular poirot story, so i really need to get over it. lol. maybe its because i committed the sin of seeing the film before reading the book, but i found this to be very average. not overwhelming, not underwhelming. just whelming. so lets break it down. pros:- the straightforward way the characters are presented, how the crime is introduced, and all the evidence that is gathered makes for a very easy way to follow poirots deductions. some may say its pretty formulaic, with each chapter being an interview of a different suspect, but i think it works. - even though i already knew “whodunnit,” i still think the mystery/crime itself is creative, especially with it being confined to one location/setting. cons:- the writing is soooo bland and sterile. there is no introspection or descriptive narrative. its very matter-of-fact dialogue and informative action and thats it. i mean, i tend to prefer dialogue-heavy stories, but this is too much. even for me. - poirot. hes such a jerk! are we meant to like him? because i cant stand him. - each of the twelve suspects feel like carbon copies of each other. i mixed up who was who so many times. overall, a great story for the time period it was written and i would love to ride the orient express one day, but i guess im still a sherlock kind of girl. ↠ 3 stars"

Even with a myriad number of characters, it won't be difficult for a reader to get on with the story.Of course, as the title depicts there was a murder during the four trian journey and the whole plot revolves around solving the mystery of who the murderer would be.I really enjoyed this one. Recommended for all.And even if this book is a part of the Poirot series, like me you can start with any of the book in the series.This one will stay with me forever."
20,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1452829-mary-ravager-of-tomes,Rating 4 out of 5,"I read this book mostly in preparation for the 2017 film adaption, but I've always been curious about Agatha Christie. She's been recommended to me multiple different times over the course of my life, but I never felt the time was quite right to pick up one of her novels until now. The premise is very straightforward; master detective Hercule Poirot happens to be aboard the Orient Express rail car when one of the passengers is killed in the night. He is then set to the task of solving the crime while the train is excavated from a surprise snow drift. Because this is such a short mystery novel, I believe it's best to go in with as little outside knowledge as possible. In fact, there's only one thing I really want to focus on in this review and that is this. I did not guess the murderer. That is probably the biggest compliment a reviewer can pay to a mystery novel. I didn't even know what the hell was going on for most of this novel if I'm being perfectly honest. Now, call me an idiot if you feel so inclined, but I personally thought the mystery was very well written. Especially given that we discover clues in time with Hercule Poirot & are limited to knowing only what he knows. The conclusion of this novel took it to a place I never would've conceptualized & it was such a fun ride getting there.As for the rest, I recommend you pick this up and discover it for yourself. A very approachable murder mystery novel with a classic feel & unique twist!"
21,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60866073-baba,Rating 3 out of 5,"2012 review: Hercule Poirot, book #10 is one of his most famous and without doubt a modern classic. There is a murder on the Orient Express, and then the train gets stranded in snow, giving Poirot the perfect setting to investigate the murder, as all suspects are stuck on the train, but without any collaborative evidence being provided with no mail, telephony or external contact. A wonderful red herring and twist filled mystery deserved of its classic status! A 'locked-room' murder investigated in a 'locked-room' environment! 7 out of 12."

23,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7317186-celeste,Rating 5 out of 5,"I have a confession to make. I’ve never read an Agatha Christie novel. Why is this a big deal, you might be asking yourself if you have also never jumped on the Christie train. (Train? Get it? Because this entire book takes place on a train! *laughs forever at own joke*) Well, I’m a life-long bookworm, with a degree in English literature to prove it. And Agatha Christie is the unarguable queen of an entire genre. Did you know that Agatha Christie is the best selling novelist of all time, second only to the Bible and the works of Shakespeare in terms of sales? Because I sure didn’t. I knew that she was a big deal in the mystery genre, but bestselling novelist of all time? I was unaware. But I know now, and have now taken my first step to rectifying my oversight.So the question is: what did I think of my first Christie novel? I loved it! This was the tenth installment of the Hercule Poirot series, but thankfully it was a perfect place to start. From what I’ve gathered, each Poirot novel stands perfectly well on its own, and that was definitely the case with Murder on the Orient Express. This little novel was published in 1934, and it has aged incredibly well. Even though the book was published 83 years ago, the language was incredibly simple and easy to sink into, and the plot was super engaging. I loved that all of the suspects were confined to the train with Poirot and the victim, and that Poirot had no outside assistance to aid his crime solving. Also, that ending was a complete surprise to me. I usually manage to guess plot twists and endings, especially in murder mysteries. I didn’t guess this ending, and it was refreshing.The characters were wonderfully varied. Some of them tended to almost be caricatures, but always for a reason. The star of the book, Poirot, actually took a back seat to the other characters, but this was very purposeful. Poirot is a more laid-back and introverted person than many famous detectives, which works incredibly well for his line of work. When people don’t notice you, it’s easy to observe things they’d prefer remained hidden. Sherlock Holmes has always been my favorite detective. I’ve read every single novel and short story Conan Doyle crafted about the famous man with the mind palace, and I am completely addicted to the BBC show starring Benedict Cumberbatch. Seriously, I’ve watched each episode at least half a dozen times. Not that there are many episodes to watch… *sobs in a corner* That being said, I already love Hercule Poirot. I don’t know that he’ll ever quite equal Sherlock, but I fully intend to give him every opportunity. I will be reading more Christie novels, and soon.For more of my reviews, as well as my own fiction and thoughts on life, check out my blog, Celestial Musings."

All aboard to the mystery!

WILL THE REAL POIROT PLEASE STAND UP?
My visual memory of the famous fictional detective Hercule Poirot is the actor Sir Peter Ustinov, yes, I know, he doesn’t look like he’s described on books (and even according Agatha Christie’s daughter, he doesn’t behave on screen like the book detective) but when I was a kid, I’ve never read any Agatha Christie’s novels, meanwhile I have watched several of the theatrical films and TV movies made by Peter Ustinov and along with watching him in several Biblical movies, well, that image stuck in me.Curiously enough, I remember watched the 1974’s adaptation to film of Murder on the Orient Express but I didn’t remember that Ustinov wasn’t in that particular adaptation but Albert Finney. As I told you, the image of Ustinov stuck quite deep in my memories.I haven’t watched the recent work by David Suchet, that thinking about the actor, he looks indeed like it should be look like the fictional Hercule Poirot.However, now in the incoming (November 2017) new adaptation where Kenneth Branagh will perform the famous detective, and while certainly he doesn’t look like Ustinov, Finney or Suchet, I trust in the great acting skills and carisma of Branagh to deliver an amusing new version of the Poirot.
TRAPPED WITH A MURDER!
Not always, but it’s cleat that Agatha Christie enjoyed to find amusing ways to keep trapped her characters in a scenario where they were unable to leave the place and well knowing that a murderer is between them and even sharing space with the corpse.You can find similar trap-like situations in other books like Death on the Nile (having Poirot investigating that case too) and the famous And There Were None, for example.Here, in Murder on the Orient Express, the cast of characters are trapped in a train (The Orient Express, duh!) due a snowfall, in the middle of nowhere, so they can’t get out, and a murder is committed.Due the crime is in 1934, they haven’t ways on the train to communicate with anyone asking for help (for the crime or the snowfall), and the responsibility to find a culprit for the murder is up to the famous Hercule Poirot, that coincidentally get aboard, in the last minute, on the equally famous Orient Express.This is challenge to Poirot in the mental field, having to trust in the testimonies of strangers but......also he should do a balance between law and justice……since not all crimes need to be really solved……while other crimes deserved sharp justice.
LYING MYSELF
When I watched the trailer of the incoming new adaptation (November 2017) of Murder on the Orient Express, I knew that it was about time to read the original novel finally, and before of the premiere of the new film.I’d watched the 1974’s adaptation when I was a kid, sometime that a local TV station did a cycle of Agatha Christie’s mystery movies (theatrical and made-for-TV alike) and while I hadn’t remember many details,……well, the solution is so epic (don’t worry I won’t spoil it!) that it stuck in my head as deep as the image of Ustinov (not matter that he wasn’t in that particular adaptation!).So, for reading this novel, I had to lie myself and keeping engaged at the speed of the developments in the book, without thinking how it was solved, and you know what?...…it worked!Since I enjoyed a lot the reading of the book, not matter that I had clear how it’d end (again, I won’t spoil it! Trust me! Geez!), I had fun analyzing the clues exposed, trying to figure out how Poirot would be able to come to his own conclussions.This is an entertaining reading and rather quick to do."
26,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4639825-j-o,Rating 4 out of 5,"“But I know human nature, my friend, and I tell you that, suddenly confronted with the possibility of being tried for murder, the most innocent person will lose his head and do the most absurd things.”This was my first ever read of an Agatha Christie novel and my very first formal introduction to Hercule Poirot, the indomitable Belgian detective. It is perhaps the most famous of the Poirot novels and, being English and being a voracious bookwyrm, I was acutely aware of this book. My mind has nothing but David Suchet when anyone mentions Poirot and there is no one that comes to mind quicker when one mentions Agatha Christie. The two are intertwined so perfectly the one could not exist without the other.However, despite the fame and fortune of the title, I had no idea of any spoilers. I knew the plot, vaguely: a train-the Orient Express no less-trapped in snow; a murder and several suspects; no police, only the egg-shaped cerebral deductions from a peculiar man. I find it quite something that I've never come across the ending to this novel, but then, I have not seen the film and despite my love of David Suchet I have never sat myself down and watched it. Other things seemed more important.“Hercule Poirot addressed himself to the task of keeping his moustaches out of the soup.”The plot itself is by this century tired and old, yet Christie's writing keeps it fresh and wonderful. There is no great ingenuity here, no advanced plot devices and no wiley tropes to bulk out the text. It is a pure and simple mystery crime novel that is executed to the highest degree. There are no pointless tangents, nor indeed do we get in to the mind of the killers. We are simply thrust in to the very capable hands of Hercule Poirot, and my did he delight me.“He went out of the compartment and returned a few moments later with a small spirit stove and a pair of curling tongs. ""I use them for the moustaches,"" he said, referring to the latter.” It was this quote that endeared me toward Poirot more than anything else. The beginning of the novel did not hold my attention: a murdered American on a stranded train? It is not completely compelling. I put the book down for two weeks whilst my boyfriend visited to gain relief from the 40 degree heat of France. I didn't pick it up again for another couple of weeks for no particular reason.Happily, and as you can tell, I did. The beginning was nothing particular, but the ending was stellar. Fondly, I guessed the killer correctly, but only after two previous guesses had been dismissed: this was just over half way when the links were just beginning to join. Christie has a wonderful way of wrapping you around her little teases, gently pushing you in to Poirot's mind as he too goes through the possibilities that you are also pondering. The ending gave me a satisfaction I did not know I needed. The ending of a book is not always what I strive to enjoy: I do not mind spoilers and, though I never actively seek them out, there is no twitter outrage from me about them. The journey is the key to any novel or story, if it were not then we would all be content with the beginning and ending only."

28,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"I absolutely loved everything about this mystery! I loved all of the characters and how they were all so different! One of the problems that I had with the book is that I have seen the latest movie version with Kenneth Brannaugh as Poirot and Johnny Depp as the man who is murdered so I had a hard time adapting to the idea that the man Johnny Depp played was described as an elderly gentleman with false teeth in the book. This is one of the best mystery novels that I have ever read in my entire life. I thought that Poirot was goofy, fabulous and a genius. This is only the fourth book that I have read with him as the detective. I have also read: Black Coffee which is a play about him, a collection of short stories about him and The A. B. C. Murders which I also highly recommend. I loved that the book took place on a train and that it is set during winter so it defintely felt cozy and yet creepy at the same time."

They know how to perceive the slightest sign of deception or downright the most incredible lies from highly recommendable people.The Orient Express crime is a closed-door investigation; a man is murdered one night in a train compartment blocked by snow, which no one can enter or leave.Hercule Poirot is on board, and he will have to show a lot of flairs to find the end of this strange affair.Of course, he shares his discoveries with us as the investigation progresses, and above all, the meager elements that he sows, like cheese crumbs, make readers little mice eager to find the big chunk of Cheddar cheese till the end."

Good luck having a future in this business, lady, with those kinds of backdoor shenanigans.*There’s no way this stakes**-on-a-train whodunit is going to register as more than a blip on the mystery-reading public’s consciousness, given that the bumbling trio of investigators—a handlebar mustache-sporting Sherlock wannabe*** supported by a perpetually perplexed and watered-down Watson and a dirty doctor—treat a dead body more like a broken balloon than a human being.

And that “twist” ending***** was as predictable as the outcome of a lawn mower running over a squirrel (which we all know means squirrel soup for dinner).What a steaming pile of warmed over detective redux.****** I need a quality literary pallet cleanser after that…now, where’s my copy of Saved by the Bell…? *I understand some people are highly in favor of backdoor shenanigans, which is understandable**Because stakes are kind of like knives, which are used to stab someone in the book…duh***Hercule Poirot is, in fact, unquestionably one of detective fiction’s greatest sleuths and departs from the Brains of 221B Baker Street in significant ways****The reason some of these cats seem like stock charactersis because so many stories have been influenced by Murder on the Orient Express; I guess you could say that Agatha Christie was the original shelf stocker*****The classic and delightful twist has been repeated and parodied so many times across so many mediums that it’s become cliché, but it still feels surprising and shocking when you read the book******It’s a classic for a reason, people—sure, it’s got some creaky parts and some less-than-stellar turns of phrase, but it was an original and innovative story that’s been read, copied, and imitated countless times since its publication…well worth a read(I tried to work in the murderer being a TRAINed killer with a ""loco motive""...but that would have just been ridiculous.)"
32,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2795921-justin,Rating 4 out of 5,"You know what I love about this book, Goodreads? You wanna know what makes this book just a downright pleasure to read? It’s just a good old-fashioned murder mystery with no frills, no multiple timelines, not big plot twists, no no no no. It’s not that at all. It’s just a short little mystery with an overwhelming cast of characters to keep track of, and, gee whiz, are these guys eccentric. And they all could be a suspect. So here’s how the book breaks down:There is a murder on the Orient Express. I’m sorry if that spoiled the book for you. Poirot and his awesome mustache interview the passengers on the train. Poirot, awesomely mustached, considered everyone’s testimony and examines all of the evidence. Poirot, alone with aforementioned mustache, creates some theories of what could have happened. Poirot and his mustache address the others with what happened at the end of the book. That’s it. And the end is absolutely worth it. I really enjoyed kicking back and just settling into this one. I never found myself thing to solve the mystery on my own. I just let the story unfold without drawing my own conclusions. I loved the simplistic format of crime, interviews, evidence, solve the crime, books over. Have a nice day. It’s a really concise mystery that doesn’t waste time with fluff and description, except Poirot’s mustache. It’s driven by dialogue as the investigation plays out, not by unnecessary side plots or backstory or whatever. This was my third Agatha Christie novel, and I’ve loved al of them so far. I’m only ready the popular ones though, and i guess I have like 63 to go or something. I’m not holding my breath. She’s a great writer though and can really weave a story together with a satisfying ending. And now I get to watch the newish movie that came out last year. More on that later, maybe. I doubt it. "

I liked it a lot, again, it's a wonderful tale from a writer who is at this point, book ten or so, at the top of her game here, it's just breathlessly good writing in places. And quirky, funny, dated, stuffy, on the very surface of it to belie what is going on beneath it all. I had intended to read them all in order of composition but I needed an audiobook and the library didn't have the fourth book, so I took this one, her tenth, and it's so much better than the first three I have recently read.But as much as I enjoyed it, it was mixed up in my head with the trip itself, to visit one of my best friends who has been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, an ""incurable but possibly survivable"" blood cancer. He's so far surviving the onslaught of the disease, but he's been physically and psychically devastated by it and I am devastated for him. So along the way, I'm counting things as I listen, as one does on trips with family: License plates (from 32 different states!), but then, maybe partly because of my state of mind, I also count dead things, too: Dead deer along the way (12 on the way there alone, a 3 1/2 hour trip!), 3 dead raccoons, an otter, a few rabbits; on the radio there are reports of 30 gun/gang murders in Chicago this past weekend on the news; traffic slows around Battle Creek along I-94 for a (I learned later) dead truck driver whose rig flipped off the road just minutes before I passed. And then as the backdrop to all of this there is this silly and accomplished entertainment, this murder mystery read aloud to me as I drive. An experience of reading Agatha as an opportunity for a reflection on mortality? I had thought it was just a collection of writing tricks![update: thanks to the wonders of modern medicine, my friend is THREE years later (as of 5/19, and still in 2/24!!) cancer-free of this ""incurable"" cancer, myeloma! The same luck was unfortunately not afforded to the murder victim on the Orient Express, about which I have mixed feelings. Murder is a terrible crime, but without it, we would not have this book!]PS: This is my more book-focused review of another edition:https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1..."
34,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,Rating 4 out of 5,"All aboard the murder train!A long time ago when I was in high school and dinosaurs still roamed the earth I read a whole bunch of Agatha Christie novels. The weird thing is that I was never that big of a fan of hers. I was getting into mystery novels, she’s one of the best known writer in the genre, and the local library had a whole bunch of her stuff. At some point I realized that I prefer my murders to be a bit less civilized, and I moved onto other styles of the genre without giving much thought to ole Agatha after that. However, I recently watched the latest film adaptation done by Kenneth Branagh and even though it’s just OK that gave me the urge to check this out again. And it reminded me that classics are very often classics for a reason.Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is on-board the Orient Express along with an assortment of travelers and their servants. An American named Ratchett is stabbed to death in his compartment just as the train is stopped by snow. Circumstances make it seem that whoever killed Ratchett is probably still among the people in the first class car that night. As Poirot sorts through the evidence and questions suspects he finds contradictions that make solving the murder a very complex task.One of my reasons I stopped reading Christie was the impression that she didn’t play fair in her whodunits. (And since I’m going off very old memories I could certainly be wrong about that.) By that I mean that it seemed like the solution depended on some kind of in-story background information that a reader couldn’t possible know. There’s a touch of that here with a big piece of the plot involving a link to a famous fictional crime. (Although it’s obviously inspired by a famous real one.) Yet, that’s set up as background info that’s pretty much given to us as soon as it’s revealed so it doesn’t feel like Christie was just cheating by springing the unknown on a reader as a way to hide the killer. In fact, since the murder took place in a confined space where people were coming and going that everything you need to know is given to us as Poirot builds a timeline and uses a diagram to place the location of people in the train car at various times. One of the great things about this book is the way that Christie uses the logistics of this to actually give you all the clues while also obscuring the solution in the details. I’d also had the idea that her writing was very dry and boring. There’s actually a lot of touches of humor that I missed as a young idiot. Even though there’s a lot of dated things in terms of race, sex, and class it also felt like she was often making some sly commentary on attitudes of her time. For example, the guy working for the railroad is positive that an Italian passenger must have killed Ratchett since it was done with a knife, and while Poirot often seems to agree with him that circumstances make him a good suspect you also note that he begins outright mocking the guy for sticking with this theory as things evolve.I also very much liked the ending which again goes against my idea that these were very proper books that believe in strict law and order when the resolution here is a lot more interesting and complex.I may have to try some more of these books to see exactly what else I was wrong about."

I mean, that should be a normal reaction for reading this book. Honestly, i don’t know how i’ll make a good review for this but i’ll give it a try.First of all, i’d like to say that this is one of the best books i’ve ever read in my 23 years of living. I don’t think i’m exaggerating though.Second, the way the story was written, the details, the clues — it’s like you, as the reader, are the one solving the case which actually is the reason why this book will get you so hooked. To be honest, my mind was at work all the while i’m reading this. I seriously could not stop reading and whenever i had to put the book down, it aches me. It’s a page-turner kind of book, i must say.Lastly, I’d like to admire the main character here — Hercule Poirot. The way he was written as a character, i believe, was well-thought of (if that is the perfect term for it).I was amazed with his POV because he was able to think of all possible scenarios, probabilities of each evidence happening, and how he was able to analyze anything that he was told. Seriously speaking, not all detectives are like him or could be like him with his great skills (and i meant no offense to anybody that would be able to relate themselves or anyone into this statement).The way he handled this case has got me sitting at the edge of my seat the whole time. And the fun part here, i have attempted throughout the whole read, to beat him with analyzing the evidence/s that were stated, and i think i only succeeded once.To add a few more thoughts, i actually realized that — because of this book — people (anyone) can do just about anything when forced to face with a situation that required so much emotional struggle for a person to handle. If asked to read this book again, i would say yes. So i’m giving this book 5 stars and i would probably see the movie now to compare and see a visual of what i just read.To those who haven’t read this book yet, start now and happy reading!!!!! :)🖤Just want to include something here about the movie since i decided to check it out as well and some are asking — in my opinion, it was a very fast-paced version of the book. Nothing really negative but i’d prefer the book than the movie because the investigation was more detailed. Every single detail was written (like interviews, gathering & analyzing evidences and statements, etc). Overall though, it’s basically the same. You won’t be disappointed with the movie. ** To see my full length review, click the link below: 👇🏼https://geekyalien.com/author/alexist..."
36,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19300421-bionic-jean,Rating 4 out of 5,"In late 1928, the author Agatha Christie made her first journey on the elegant, luxurious train, the “Orient Express”. The experience was to stay fixed in her mind. A few months later, in February 1929, the same locomotive—the Orient Express—was stranded in a blizzard near Cherkeskoy, Turkey, for six days.A third experience with the Orient Express, two years later in December 1931, was to prove so memorable that it inspired one of her most popular crime novels, Murder on the Orient Express. Agatha Christie was once more aboard the Orient Express train, this time returning from her husband’s archaeological dig at Nineveh. However, flooding from severe rainfall had washed sections of the track away, and the train was at a standstill for twenty-four hours. Not only did this experience find its way into her fiction, but according to her biography, several passengers on the train inspired both the plot and the characters in Murder on the Orient Express. An American, Mrs. Hilton, for instance, lay behind her creation of the appalling (but very entertaining)“Mrs. Hubbard”.One other true-life incident was to prove crucial to the plot of this novel, and this was  the kidnapping and murder of Charles Lindbergh’s son in 1932, two years earlier. The kidnapping of “Daisy Armstrong” is lifted almost entirely from the Lindbergh case. A very young child, the first to be born to a wealthy high-status family, was kidnapped for a huge ransom, directly from her crib. The mother was already pregnant with another child. The ransom was paid, but the child was found dead soon afterwards. All these facts are included. Even the destiny of one of the suspects is identical. A maid, who was rather chatty, was suspected of involvement in the Lindbergh crime. Although she was innocent, she killed herself after being interrogated by the police.Incorporating so many elements of a recent high profile case into her novel, adds a feeling of authenticity. Even now the case remains famous, and an emotive one in the public’s consciousness. Since Murder on the Orient Express is, in some ways, extremely fanciful, this direct mirroring of real life helps its believability.The novel was first published in 1934, and originally titled “Murder in the Calais Coach” in the USA, before being published under its more familiar title of Murder on the Orient Express in the UK, later the same year. Once again, we are to enjoy the company of the Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot. This is his tenth appearance in the oeuvre. This time, Poirot is there at the start, en route from an earlier case, and travelling on the Taurus Express from Aleppo in Syria to Stamboul (now Istanbul). As always, he notices those around him, and we too enjoy anticipating the return of these two, a Colonel Arbuthnot, and an edgy young woman, Mary Debenham. They of course, dismiss him without further thought:“A ridiculous-looking little man. The sort of little man one could never take seriously … The little man removed his hat. What an egg-shaped head he had.”By the end of the day, the train has been delayed, and Poirot is staying overnight at the Tokatlian Hotel in Stamboul. But there he receives a telegram prompting him to return to London, because of a development in an ongoing case. Immediately, he asks the concierge to book a first-class compartment on the Simplon-route Orient Express train, which is to depart that night. Oddly the train is fully booked. However, a chance meeting with a friend of his, a fellow Belgian, Monsieur Bouc, enables him to obtain a second-class berth. Monsieur Bouc is a director of the railway, and happens to be travelling on the same train.We meet the passengers on the train as the action unfolds. As well as the aforementioned Mrs Caroline Hubbard, the English governess Mary Debenham, and the upright military man, Colonel Arbuthnot, we meet several more passengers who are to accompany us on our journey through this book. The French conductor of the Wagon-lit: Pierre Michel, is to take care of the passengers. An unpleasant elderly American businessman: Samuel Ratchett, is in the centre of the train, and the centre of the plot. Travelling with him are his American secretary: Hector McQueen, and his valet: Edward Henry Masterman. Other passengers are Hildegarde Schmidt: a German Lady’s maid to the haughty Russian Princess Dragomiroff, who is also travelling. There is Antonio Foscarelli: an Italian Ford car salesman, Greta Ohlsson: a missionary teacher who prompts the hilarious aside from the twittery Mrs Hubbard “Poor creature - she’s a Swede!”, and the Count and Countess Adrenyi. Finally, there is Cyrus Bethman Hardmann: a travelling salesman for typewriter ribbons  who reveals his true identity during Poirot’s interview, to be an American private detective. There are 13 passengers in all, plus a mysterious “A.M. Harris” who has not arrived, and Poirot and his friend. Such an odd assortment of passengers causes Poirot to ponder and reflect:“All around us are people, of all classes, of all nationalities, of all ages. For three days these people, these strangers to one another, are brought together. They sleep and eat under one roof, they cannot get away from each other. At the end of three days they part, they go their several ways, never, perhaps, to see each other again.”The businessman, Mr Ratchett, approaches Poirot, attempting to hire him as a protector, because he has received threatening letters and believes his life is in danger:“He was a man of between sixty and seventy. From a little distance he had the bland aspect of a philanthropist. His slightly bald head, his domed forehead, the smiling mouth that displayed a very white set of false teeth, all seemed to speak of a benevolent personality. Only the eyes belied this assumption. They were small, deep set and crafty. Not only that. As the man, making some remark to his young companion, glanced across the room, his gaze stopped on Poirot for a moment, and just for that second there was a strange malevolence, and unnatural tensity in the glance.”Poirot is not tempted. Despite the huge amount of money the man offers, Poirot does not take to the man at all:“What’s wrong with my proposition?”Poirot rose. “If you will forgive me for being personal—I do not like your face M. Ratchett.”And dramatically describes Ratchett to his friend:“The body—the cage—is everything of the most respectable—but through the bars, the wild animal looks out.”Agatha Christie continues to stack up the elements which make a classic golden age mystery. On the second night of the journey, in Belgrade, two extra coaches are added to the train. Monsieur Bouc gives up his first-class compartment to Poirot, and moves to a different coach himself. Everything is arranged, as the compartment now belonging to Poirot adjoins one in which a murder victim is travelling. Yes, there must be a murder, in this closed train. What’s more, the train is halted by a snowdrift near Vincovci, on the very evening of the murder. Nobody can now get in, and nobody can get out either. As Poirot so succinctly puts it at the end of chapter 5:“The murderer is with us—on the train now …”By this time we are about a quarter of the way through the novel. Murder on the Orient Express is a highly structured—perhaps even overstructured—piece of writing. There are 3 parts: “The Facts”, “The Evidence”, and “Hercule Poirot Sits Back and Thinks”. Each part contains between 8 and 15 chapters. The middle section devotes one chapter to each of the passengers. We know of Poirot’s predilection for “order and method”, and in several novels we are presented with a list of events, suspects’ movements, or questions arising, all ostensibly through the diminutive detective’s making of lists, and invited to reason it out for ourselves. This time the development is even tighter, and the writing just a little too dry because of it.However, the case is intriguing and puzzling in the extreme. I have read this novel several times over the years, and seen a few dramatisations too, so the audacious explanation is well known to me, and no longer a surprise. This is a little sad, as I cannot now remember my feelings on a first reading, but am sure I must have been amazed.Poirot has no access to the outside world, and is directed by his friend Monsieur Bouc to investigate the case in the absence of the official police. When they arrive, he will hand over whatever he has discovered. This suits Poirot admirably. He is always scornful of those who examine clues minutely, since he believes in the supreme power of the “little grey cells”:“‘… we have none of the facilities afforded to the police. We cannot investigate the bona fides of any of these people. We have to rely solely on deduction. That, to me, makes the matter very much more interesting. There is no routine work. It is a matter of the intellect.’”It is a nice slant on the approach of consulting detective Sherlock Holmes, in the novels by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, which Agatha Christie clearly emulated. Sadly Captain Arthur Hastings, who acted the same role as Doctor Watson, does not appear in Murder on the Orient Express. However, his part is well played by Monsieur Bouc, and a later addition, Doctor Constantine, who conducted a formal examination of the body.Hence the final third of the book. Poirot puts together all the clues, and there are many! In splendid classic mystery fashion, the glass of the victim’s watch has smashed, thereby stopping the watch at the exact time of the murder. In the compartment are found various items, including a pipe cleaner, a button from a uniform, a spent match, a burnt fragment of a letter, a dainty handkerchief, and so on:“And most conveniently she leaves her handkerchief behind!” said Poirot. “Exactly as it happens in the books and on the films—and to make things even easier for us it is marked with an initial.”“Does a man who commits suicide stab himself in ten—twelve—fifteen places?” he asked. Poirot’s eyes opened. “That is great ferocity,” he said. “It is a woman,” said the chef de train, speaking for the first time. “Depend upon it, it was a woman. Only a woman would stab like that.”As each clue is found, Poirot seems to become more gleeful, yet the director of the railway, the doctor—and it has to be said, the reader—become increasingly confused. As Monsieur Bouc comments:“‘Lies—and again lies—it amazes me the amount of lies we had told to us this morning.’‘There are still more to discover,’ said Poirot cheerfully.’”“If you confront anyone who has lied with the truth, they usually admit it— often out of sheer surprise. It is only necessary to guess right to produce your effect.”Various people are reported as having moved through the train on the evening of the murder. One wore a scarlet kimono, festooned with dragons, another was a “small dark man with a womanish voice—and eventually the murder weapon itself was found—amid great hysteria. Can Poirot put all these disparate elements together, sort out fact from fiction, and work out who committed the heinous crime? Of course he can! Naturellement! Hercule Poirot is a private detective par excellence:“‘I am not a Yugo-Slavian detective, Madame. I am an international detective.’”‘You belong to the League of Nations?’‘I belong to the world, Madame,’ said Poirot dramatically. He went on ‘I work mainly in London.’”There are quite a few little humorous additions such as this, from Agatha Christie. Here is another such, when Poirot fully expects Hector MacQueen to know of his famous detecting skills, and recognise his name, but is crestfallen at MacQueen’s reply:“Why, it does sound kind of familiar—only I always thought it was a woman’s dressmaker.”Or this:“‘Miss Debenham is a pukka sahib.’”Dr. Constantine queried …“‘It means,’ said Poirot, ‘that Miss Debenham’s father and brothers were at the same sort of school as Colonel Arbuthnot.’”For those who know the story, and perhaps also those who are a dab hand at solving these sorts of complex cases, there are indicators in the early part of the text, that Poirot is well on the way to solving the case, and merely needs a little confirmation. Here is one, as stated by Colonel Arbuthnot, half way through the novel:
“‘Trial by jury is a sound system.’Poirot looked at him thoughtfully for a minute or two.‘Yes,’ he said, ‘I am sure that would be your view.’“
.“One cannot complain of having no clues in this case. There are clues here in abundance”But for Poirot, who has formulated a theory quite a few chapters ago, they confirm his suspicions:“This compartment is full of clues, but can I be sure that those clues are really what they seem to be?”At the end, Poirot, “neat, spruce and dandified as ever …” pompously persuses the possible and the impossible, and pronounces:“The impossible cannot have happened, therefore the impossible must be possible in spite of appearances.”The police are presented with two possible alternative solutions to the savage murder. And we know precisely which one they will pick.This is a novel with an unforgettable ending. Once again Agatha Christie has appeared to write a solid formulaic golden age murder mystery—and then she takes the reader’s breath away by breaking all the rules. If it were not for the tightness of the form of the novel, which restricts more interesting writing, this would be one of her best novels, and a five star read. But most of us, much as we like to try to guess “whodunnit”, need a little more than a set of boxes to tick.Nevertheless, Hercule Poirot has, by this tenth novel a substantial and loyal following, who indulge peccadilloes such as his superlative moustaches, with humour and great affection:“He went out of the compartment and returned a few moments later with a small spirit stove and a pair of curling tongs. ‘I use them for the moustaches,’ he said, referring to the latter.”“Hercule Poirot addressed himself to the task of keeping his moustaches out of the soup.”On then, to the next adventure of Monsieur Hercule Poirot!"

The man asks Mr. Poirot, to work for him he needs a very good bodyguard desperately.

So, for those mystery lovers who have not read The Murder on the Orient Express so far, I will post a single line review: Go and read it! This one rocks! What are you waiting for?Now, the review for fellow mystery and Christie lovers who have read the book(or like me, re-read umpteen number of times till the pages came out of the binding!).Whodunits are like magic tricks. The writer shows you everything: the clues are all before your eyes: you rack your brains, trying to fit a solution on the jigsaw, but are unable to do so: then, in the last chapter, the author reveals that one bit of detail which you overlooked, but which was actually crucial to the solution. You kick yourself for being such an idiot, then bask in the afterglow of having been fooled by a master.A conventional whodunit has certain rules. First, there is a murder. There are a fixed number of people who could have done the murder, who are equal in terms of motive and opportunity. As the story progresses through its twists and turns, the reader keeps on guessing, shifting his suspicion from one suspect to another. If the novel is well-written, the author will succeed in totally removing suspicion from the actual murderer before the final revelation.Very rarely does an author break the basic rules and get away with it smoothly, as Agatha Christie does in this novel. It shows what a master of the craft she is.The Murder on the Orient Express is a classic locked room mystery: in the snowed-in train, one of the twelve passengers have to be guilty. And as the past history of Ratchett (the victim) as the mastermind behind the kidnapping and murder of little Daisy Armstrong comes to light, we know that we are in for a real humdinger: because there are so many people wishing him out of the way, and many of them are likely to be on the Calais coach. But when Poirot unearths the fact that each and every one of the passengers is connected to the Armstrong family in some way, we feel that Dame Agatha has stretched coincidence to the limit, even if it is in the interest of a good detective yarn.But then all is revealed: There is no coincidence. They are all there as part of a plan, and they are all guilty! In fact, Poirot is the coincidence, the joker in the pack.I have not read another mystery where all the likely suspects are guilty! This is such a grand flouting of convention that would have fallen flat on its face, had not the story been carefully structured to make it possible. The American household is possibly the only one in the world where you can find all nationalities. If such had not been the case, the connection of the occupants of the coach to the Armstrong family would have been evident much before Christie wanted to reveal it. And the snowed-in train is the only possible setting where all the suspects could be cloistered without the possibility of outside interference, as the plotters thought the train would move on, and that the murder would be attributed to a person or persons unknown. It all fits in the end.Also, this one story where the ending is just perfect.(On rereading the story, I noticed certain incidents and snippets of dialogue (especially the one between Colonel Arbuthnot and Mary Debenham) which seemed to point in one direction but on hindsight, were crystal-clear in their meaning. This is why I love rereading Christie's books... it gives valuable insights into the author's technique.)Dame Agatha Christie might not be a great writer: there are more ""literary"" mystery writers out there, like Dorothy L. Sayers and P. D. James. But as the spinner of a classical mystery, it is my humble opinion that there is none to touch her... and that there is no sleuth to match the little Belgian with the magnificent moustaches and the egg-shaped head."

Luckily for me, Kennett Branagh decided to remake Murder on the Orient Express. The movie was fantastic and everything I wanted it to be, which gave me perfect reason to find the book and give it a shot! And it was INCREDIBLE.I'm amazed by how talented Agatha Christie was. The pure talent for writing shown in this book is so shocking, and it makes me desperate to read every other book she has written. Hopefully, I'll be able to find them in my adventures!This book is the 10th novel in the series, but it is very easy to pick up and start reading. I had no issue being pulled into the story and not wanting to put the book down. The language is a bit old fashioned (since it's an older book) so there may be a disconnect for some present readers, but that seemed to be the only issue I could find when I picked this book apart.In short, the plot for this book is there is a murder on the Orient Express train and Hercule Poirot (a wildly famous detective) is determined to solve it. The twist? Multiple suspects aboard a stalled train. The book is fun, fast paced and wildly addicting. If you love a good mystery, trying to solve this story is absolutely delightful! Everyone has an alibi and Poirot can only find out information by asking questions and looking at their reactions (because...GASP!...there's no electronic devices in the time period this book is set in). I knew the ending already from watching the movie, but trying to pick out the evidence that led to Hercule's final thoughts was so much fun! I scrambled along the way and enjoyed every second of this book.Overall, this book is a great read! If you want to read a classic, a mystery or just a fun book I really suggest this one! It'll keep you hooked and make your head spin in circles.Five out of five stars!"

The first was The Murder of Roger Ackroyd which I loved and like Murder on the Orient Express I didn't guess the killer. Agatha Christie is The Best-Selling novelist of all time and pretty much invented and perfected the whodunit. Orient is neatly crafted, elegant and fun. All of Christie's novels(I'm basing this on all 2 of her books, I've read) have a simple layout, A murder is committed, an array of suspects and just enough info to pose a theory. It sounds simple and you should be able to solve it but I didn't DAMN IT! With Orient a man is murdered on a train, all 12 people on the train car are suspects, the train is snowed in and the police cannot reach it. Unfortunately for the murderer, the world famous detective Hercule Poirot is on board. This sounds so simple but I didn't guess the murderer. As soon as the murderer was revealed I felt dumb because it was so obvious and therein lies the genius of Agatha Christie.

GR reminded me of other novels by this author; and,2. February 2024 is my self-appointed ""Classics"" Month!Praises:1. I like a ""locked room"" mystery, where the only suspects in this story are on a snowbound train with a despised man who is murdered by being stabbed twelve times!2. it's an interesting ""whodunit""! World-famous Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, uses interrogation (with a few physical clues) to solve this mystery. I had fun trying to keep the clues in line. Who had the motive and the opportunity? I didn't see it coming; and,3. narrator, Dan Stevens, does an excellent job with accents, pacing and intonation. With over a dozen characters to voice over, I was pleasantly surprised that I could keep them all straight!Niggles:1. MC Hercule Poirot comes off as pompous and smug. A little humility on his part would have been nice. I was a little annoyed by some of this ""renowned"" detective's questioning techniques; and,2. I was quite disturbed by M. Bouc (Poirot's sidekick). Not only would he divulge vital information to the suspects, he would often spout off mind-blowing racist theories!Overall Thoughts:I watched the 2017 film soon after finishing this audiobook. Although it depicted a lot more action (which at times didn't feel right to me,) most of it stayed true to the book. At least M. Bouc didn't come of as a racist ass!Christie is known as the Queen of Mystery. This was my first look into Hercule Poirot, and I found that it works as a standalone. As far as mysteries go, it's a good one, but be prepared for a lot of red herrings!"

Must have slipped my mind. Maybe because I'm so excited to see the movie adaption with Judi Dench, Rooney Mara and Daisy Ridley.Anyway, this wasn't what I had expected, and then again it was. Now, whenever I saw this book on here or in a bookshop I pictured a very diverse and interesting cast of characters and a classic murder mystery. So far so good. I also imagined sun and heat and maybe something typically oriental but my own stupidity stopped me from realizing that in Winter, you know, it's cold. Even on the Orient Express. Especially in the mountains. Well done, Kai.Apart from that I got what I wanted: a fascinating murder case, lots of suspects and an equal amount of liars, traditional detective work and a spectacular ending. The only thing this novel lacked of was suspense. And that's one thing a crime novel should have for sure. Not even the big murderer revelation was all that thrilling anymore.

But HOW??*Murder on the Orient Express is one of Agatha Christie's most revered books for a reason. She uses the trope of the locked room mystery as a foundation and then further heightens the ""impossible"" crime by situating that locked room on a moving train. If that's not enough reinventing of the old mystery wheel for one day, her solution is also a bit of a game-changer, but I'll not say too much about that here!I will, however, offer some suggestions for readers looking for locked room mysteries that are a bit off the beaten path. During the Golden Age of Detective Fiction, locked room stories were very popular, and those of you who are interested in classic examples of the genre should have no trouble finding print anthologies or online archives to explore. But i'm drawn to the ""yes, and..."" approach to writing, with conventions given a little twist, genres blended, those unexpected tweaks that make a book memorable.

I listened to the audiobook, performed by Dan Stevens, and it was a delight. A quick summary: The international detective Poirot is in Istanbul and is eager to get back to London. Thanks to help from a friend, he gets the last berth on the Orient Express, which was full of passengers. On the second night of the trip, a man is murdered, and tensions rise when the train gets stuck in a snowdrift. Poirot realizes the murderer must still be on the train, and sets out to interview everyone and figure out who is lying. This is a clever story, and I can see why it's one of Christie's most beloved mysteries.Dan Stevens' performance was so marvelous that after finishing I looked up what other books he has narrated and was thrilled to see he also did a reading of And Then There Were None.

50,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63328133-sheri,Rating 5 out of 5,"As I started reading this mystery, I thought about whether I should read with the intent to ferret out the clues and deduce the criminal mastermind, or whether I should just sit back and enjoy the careful unveiling of the facts. Ultimately, I decided to go with the latter, mostly because I know I am no detective, especially not to match the likes of Poirot. Hercule Poirot makes detective work look easy and relatively effortless. His friend M. Bouc reminds him of this: ""Lie back and think -- use (as I have heard you say so often) the little grey cells of the mind -- and you will know!"" (p. 56) Poirot himself admits that ""[This mystery] is a matter of the intellect."" (p. 192) He goes on to say that he does not rely on intuition, but regards the probabilities. His investigation proceeds in an orderly fashion, advancing one step at a time. Seemingly, if the reader also follows this logical, methodical, and thoughtful procedure, then they will also be able to solve the crime. But alas, it is not so easy, at least for this reader. I am consoled that M. Bouc must too defer to the great detective saying,""The elucidation of crime is your métier, not mine, my friend."" (p. 250) It is a superb mystery with many suspects and red herrings to keep you on your toes. Each new clue will have you revising your theory. As you draw closer to the conclusion and final reveal, you will find yourself agreeing with Dr. Constantine when he states ""This is more wildly improbable than any roman policier I have ever read."" (p. 292)I don't know who to admire more -- Agatha Christie for crafting such a marvelous mystery, or Hercule Poirot for having the superior intellect to solve it. Bravo to both of them!"
51,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus,Rating 5 out of 5,"Rating: 5* of five, mostly for the Agatha Christie's Poirot adaptationThe Publisher Says: Just after midnight, a snowdrift stopped the Orient Express in its tracks. The luxurious train was surprisingly full for the time of the year. But by the morning there was one passenger fewer. A passenger lay dead in his compartment, stabbed a dozen times, his door locked from the inside.My Review: Well, that was a concise-to-the-point-of-terseness summary. But I suspect most of us who are voracious or even simply serious readers of mystery fiction don't need too much more than that to recall the details to mind.The novel, published in 1934, is a bit of a stretch for a modern mystery-reader's sense of fair play. Poirot's famous/infamous ""little gray cells"" are pumpin' full-bore and lead him to near-miraculous feats of deduction. The novel's Poirot is, at the end, almost cavalier about the hugely out-of-character ending. It almost feels as if Christie said to herself, ""Self, I've had enough of this character's ethics and am writing MY ending not his.""Her book, her rules.The 1974 film, available on Amazon Prime, is rather sabotaged by Albert Finney's ham-fisted death-grippy nasality as Poirot. I want to give him a neti pot and a Fleet bottle and insist he use both before coming back on screen. Damned bad casting.The filmed-for-television version offers more scope for fair play with the reader as Poirot is seen to do things and discover things that lead him to a startling and evidently disturbing conclusion. In keeping with the films' expansion of the Poirot character, the book's resolution is more nuanced, and affords a modern viewer more satisfaction in that the character of Poirot is clearly emotionally involved in the murder's resolution and becomes a richer, more relatable person as a result.Both versions of the story are so improbable as to be absurd, on the face of it. But in a world run on decent principles, such a story and such a resolution would be more common than not. I feel very Old-Testament-y about people who harm children or animals for cruelty or sport. The film's other deviations from the novel are also deepening the sense of Poirot's reality as a person, and indicative of just how very surprising this ending is within the understanding Christie has given us of Poirot's essential relationship to crime-solving. A scene at the beginning of the film, between Poirot and a soldier (hinted at in the original), is particularly important in setting the tone for this story's exceptional place in the Poirot canon. Another early scene in Istanbul is, in my opinion, gratuitous; well conceived, but not necessary, and frankly unpleasant in the light it sheds on Poirot.But the sheer visual beauty of this film! The pitch-perfect Poirot of David Suchet! Ah mes amis, this is the treat most exceptional, this feast is the repast most gustatorial for the lover of the how you call a crime drama. It is the pleasure most complete. Replenish yourselves and your little gray cells! "

I mean, it wasn’t super bad, but it surely wasn’t great either. I was all just very... mweh. First of all, the mystery itself is quite preposterous and far-fetched. In fact, the actual reveal of the murder is so convoluted that the book basically needs to shove aside all the facts it has stated before to make it make sense. It is revealed in the end that basically everything was a misdirection and that every single witness was lying. Like, okay?? I guess I’m supposed to be shocked by that, but all it really did was make me feel like the whole book was a waste. After all, there was no real mystery in the book, because there was no way you could have figured it out. All the evidence seemed to point towards an impossible crime, because, it turns out, it really was impossible! The crime simply did not happen that way. So, we spend all this time trying to figure out a mystery that was never going to be solved! Instead, we got a big “SIKE!” moment where we’re told everything isn’t as we thought it was. I don’t like ‘mysteries’ that end like that; it feels like a major cop-out, and basically absolves the author from actually having the explain the murder in a smart way. Honestly, I prefer a well thought out murder mystery over a silly plot-twist any day.Now, when it comes to the writing, I have to say I’m having mixed feelings. On the one hand the writing was simple and straight-forward, which made it very easy to follow along with. On the other hand, however, the book was structured in a way that I found very repetitive and monotonous. The characters lacked any depth whatsoever, and everything had a very cold or sterile feeling to it. There is also no action or even a hint of suspense going on here, and instead the whole thing took on a very methodical note. It was a giant listing of evidence after evidence, only for it to later be revealed that all the “evidence” was nothing but lies and misdirection! What on earth have I spent all this time reading it for then?? The main character, Hercule Poirot, also got on my nerves for some reason. He was a very pretentious little man, who was thriving on his so called ‘intellect’, willing every person to acknowledge how smart he was. He didn’t do or say anything interesting, and was painfully unhelpful the whole way through, but did keep on asking people things like “isn’t it obvious”, when in reality, it really was NOT obvious, because the whole thing was frustratingly ridiculous and insanely coincidental! Also, I was kind of surprised by all the casual racism and sexism displayed in this book. It was even more frustrating since these prejudices were actually used as evidence to either condemn or absolve suspects in the whole murder investigation. Like, how can I take this mystery seriously when racism/sexism is used as a serious investigative method? They called their prejudices “the Psychology” to give it an air of being scientific, when in reality, it was nothing but offensive rubbish.For example: They reason that the murderer must be a woman because no man would be hysterical enough to stab a man twelve times. They also reason that the murderer cannot be an Englishman because they are not crass enough to stab people. Instead, the Italian man is suspected because he has the temperament and vulgarity for it! Like, really??? I’m supposed to take this investigation seriously in any way?? I think not."

Después de un período de aparente inactividad respecto a mis lecturas, decidí romper este silencio y poner manos a la obra en una nueva lectura: Asesinato en el Orient de Express. Este marca mi cuarto libro leído de Agatha Christie y tercero específicamente de Hercules Poirot, su célebre personaje detective. En este caso nos trae un asesinato en un tren ocupado por 12 pasajeros repletos de sospechas y desconfianzas, pero el problema es que también de coartadas aparentemente irrefutables (problema para nosotros, que intentamos señalar a alguien, porque para Poirot no es mas que una simple reflexión y CASO RESULTO). Me atrapó mucho, por momentos quise leer el final directamente de la ansiedad que me provocaba la incertidumbre (obvio que no lo hice •.•). La novela me encantó en todo sentido. Es muy fácil de leer y está organizada de cierta forma que queda todo muy claro y no presta a confusiones. Los interrogatorios personaje por personaje facilitaron su reconocimiento. Y es que este crimen, casi perfecto, fue brillante y muy creativo, dudo que si no hubiese estado Poirot para arruinarlo se descubriera. Poirot hace todo tan fácil y obvio que duele.  Se sabe que en las novelas de Christie, los detalles hacen la diferencia; el detalle más insignificante termina siendo más clave que el que se daba como vital. Si bien intento ir teorizando y ordenando mis ideas, ya estoy resignado, la actividad cerebral que demandan estos libros es cansadora, a veces es mejor simplemente leer. También noté que la novela está cargada de estereotipos sobre diferentes nacionalidades y género, ridiculizandolos, elemento que me gustó. Obvio que la conclusión del crimen es completamente magnífica y arriesgada (por momentos hasta cuesta creerla), pero también me encantó la conclusión del libro, ligada a una enseñanza sobre la justicia.  Estos libros son como rompecabezas perfectos, cada pieza encaja y genera satisfacción. Celebro la creatividad de la autora que rompe con típicos casos novelísticos policiales y presenta estas revelaciones que -literalmente- te vuelan la cabeza.

56,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51664350-paul-weiss,Rating 5 out of 5,"A brilliant ""locked room"" classic!THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES might be the locked room mystery that holds down honours for being the novel in which Agatha Christie introduced Hercule Poirot to a grateful reading public. But it is MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS that showcases a confident, polished Hercule at the height of his powers. Standing tall beside Sherlock Holmes and Auguste Dupin, Poirot is arguably the most widely read and best known detective in literature and MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is certainly one of the finest examples of the mystery genre. In a brilliant variation of the typical British drawing room mystery, Christie places her cast of thirteen suspects together with the victim and Poirot on the Orient Express en route from Istanbul to Calais.Mr Ratchett, an unsavory looking man who obviously has some dark secrets in his past, approaches Poirot as the train leaves Istanbul with the offer of a very fat fee asking for his services to help protect his life from enemies he knows are out to kill him. Poirot, seeing this as a very uninteresting exercise from a cerebral point of view, politely declines. But when the train is stopped in its proverbial tracks by a huge snow storm and Ratchett is killed in his locked berth, stabbed no less than twelve times, Poirot is pressed into service to solve the case by his long time friend Bouc who is also a director of the corporation that owns the train.Through the simple process gathering clues by interviewing the thirteen suspects - a wildly disparate lot that in modern terms would almost certainly be referred to as a ""motley crue"" - Poirot employs ""the little gray cells"" and intuits a positively brilliant solution. In that time honoured literary tradition of gathering all of the suspects into a single room, a somewhat less than humble Poirot puts on a flashy show of summarizing the case and revealing the identity of the perpetrator in a brilliant twist that only Poirot could fathom and only Dame Christie could create.There is nothing about MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS that does not deserve high praise - dialogue; the hilarious mis-translation of idiomatic French into spoken English; the less than subtle but accurate use of class distinctions and behavioural stereotypes unique to different nationalities; characterization; colourful narrative description; plot; suspense; red herrings; and, of course, a brilliant solution that deftly ties up every conceivable loose thread. And all of that is in an all too short package that can be read in the brief space of three or four thoroughly enjoyable hours. Read and enjoy, pass the book onto your best friend but, for goodness sake, keep your lip zipped about that brilliant ending!Paul Weiss"

I can fully appreciate that Agatha Christie is the Queen of Crime - the level of detail and planning that obviously goes into constructing such complex crime scenes and investigation work is impressive, but it’s really not to my personal taste.The premise is exciting enough - all these strangers stuck on a train that has been sidelined by heavy snow and one of them is found murdered in his compartment - but that’s really where the intrigue ends for me. It felt very formulaic, which if all Christies are like this, I don’t think I could face another.

Nevertheless, reading Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express was an enjoyable experience. I'd just reread Murders in the Rue Morgue. Comparing Poe's detective, Dupin, with Christie's, Hercule Poirot, was thus unavoidable but quite interesting. Dupin sees solving the murders as something amusing. Likewise, Poirot sees his investigation of the murders on the Orient Express as a break from boredom. No doubt both Poe and Christie shaped the detectives we still see in fiction.

But in this case I would welcome a little scientific assistance. This compartment is full of clues, but can I be sure that those clues are really what they seem to be?When I was a kid, I loved the TV show Murder, She Wrote, starring Angela Lansbury. But I remember the jokes at the time asking why anyone would ever invite her character Jessica Fletcher anywhere, because someone would always get murdered almost as soon as she arrived. Well, it’s the same with Hercule Poirot. As soon as he set one foot on the Orient Express, every other character should have run for the exits before they became either a murder victim or suspect. The Orient Express, traveling from Istanbul to London, gets stuck in the snow at night. The next morning, one of the passengers, Samuel Edward Ratchett, is found murdered, having been stabbed more than ten times, while locked inside his compartment. Detective Poirot, who just happened to be on the train, is hired on the spot to investigate.This book is actually the first I’ve read by Agatha Christie, but she is, of course, a legend for a reason. With a minimum of buildup, the book rolls quickly into the main plot. Poirot meets his fellow passengers, the murder happens, he interviews the passengers, he reviews the physical evidence, he thinks awhile, and then he solves the crime. No muss, no fuss. It’s wonderfully written, crisp and to the point, and with a fair amount of dry humor. Almost every detail is important as either a clue or a red herring. And each character is sharply drawn, none more so than Poirot, who is both brilliant in his thoughts and deductions and tactical in his methods and actions.Like most detective novels, this one is ‘unsolvable’ in the sense that the author plants clues for multiple resolutions and then picks one ending (admittedly a great one) when she could have just as easily picked a different one. Now, due to this book’s fame, I must admit it didn’t take long before I thought to myself “oh yeah, I’m pretty sure this is the one where ....” But that knowledge did not detract from my enjoyment of the story. Moreover, there’s a last twist in the final pages that I did not see coming, and that made the ending surprisingly powerful. This book is well worth reading as a classic of the genre, even if you know what’s going to happen."

There are no tricks, no clever devices to shock and surprise the reader.

Interesting how in Murder on the Orient Express there was a train connection between Bagdad and London, something inconceivable now.However the trip is far from undisturbed, and when someone dies Poirot has suspicions towards the English, Italians and Americans on board.Stereotypes as an Anglosaxon brain and the English do not stab come back as tropes.In general Agatha Christie bashes the English a lot in this book:I like to see an angry Englishman, said Poirot, they are very amusing, the more emotional they feel the less command they seem to have over languageAlso interesting in a book of this age: already people are being called sheep.The resolution is brilliant (if a little bit unguessable without prior knowledge) and Poirot needs to choose between justice and what's right. a deserved classic in the genre and still highly readable."

One felt that nothing could escape their scrutiny. With a little exclamation he bent and picked up something from the floor.”Of course he did! Poirot is already famous as a detective when this story takes place. I don’t think there’s anything I can add here that hasn’t been discussed over the 85 years since it was written. Briefly, M. Hercule Poirot is in Istanbul, Intending to stay a few days before continuing his train journey home to London, when he receives a telegram advising him he needs to return immediately.Generally, there are few passengers at this time of year, but today the Stamboul-Calais coach is completely booked. A berth is found for him only through influence from his old friend M. Bouc, a director of the line. Even the always-saved #16 isn’t available!The passengers are a mixed bunch, coming from different backgrounds and countries, and Christie describes each so clearly that although I knew I’d never remember them all, I’d “recognise” them later. One who stood out particularly was the man who gave Poirot the chills before they’d even boarded the train, which he explained to his old friend, the director.‘‘‘When he passed me in the restaurant,’ he said at last, ‘I had a curious impression. It was as though a wild animal—an animal savage, but savage! you understand—had passed me by.’ ‘And yet he looked altogether of the most respectable.’ ‘Précisément! The body—the cage—is everything of the most respectable—but through the bars, the wild animal looks out.’ ‘You are fanciful, mon vieux,’ said M. Bouc. ‘It may be so. But I could not rid myself of the impression that evil had passed me by very close.’”I particularly enjoyed the titles of the parts and chapters. Christie’s outline is as methodical as M. Poirot’s deductive skills. I’ll list a few for fun”Part 1 - The Facts#5 – The Crime#7 – The BodyPart 2 – The Evidence#1-12 – The Evidence of each passenger#13 – The Summary of the Passengers’ Evidence#14- - The Evidence of the Weapon#15 – The Evidence of the Passengers’ LuggagePart 3 – Hercule Poirot Sits Back and Thinks#1 – Which of Them?#2 – Ten Questions#3 – Certain Suggestive Points#8 – Further Surprising Revelations#9 – Poirot Proposes Two Solutions”So there you have it – except, there is nothing to explain that the train has been stopped by a snowdrift and can’t move, so there’s nobody getting on or off or contacting anyone on the “outside”. Poirot accepts it as a challenge.“His eyes were dreamy. ‘That, to me, is the interest of this case,’ he said. ‘We are cut off from all the normal routes of procedure. Are these people whose evidence we have taken speaking the truth or lying? We have no means of finding out—except such means as we can devise ourselves. It is an exercise, this, of the brain.’”I enjoy the way Christie writes the dialogue for characters from different countries. It helps me identify them. There’s no way we could know some of the facts that Poirot does because we can’t actually see the compartments and the doors and the passageways. So he does find discrepancies in the evidence that he has to explain to us at the end. Who can see what, for example.But who cares? I’m happy to wait and feel satisfied when he clears it up.“‘It is a good phrase that,’ said Poirot. ‘The impossible cannot have happened, therefore the impossible must be possible in spite of appearances.’”Classic Christie, which is always an entertaining way to exercise the little grey cells."

But, I can definitely see why she is known for her murder mysteries - there's absolutely no way anyone could possibly have solved this one before Inspector Poirot lays it all out at the very end of the book, despite the fact that all the clues needed to solve it are given basically from the outset. This murder mystery written in 1934 still reads well even today. So if you are looking for a 'classic' to pickup, I recommend this one! The audiobook narrator, Dan Stevens, does a rather great job too. "

But after seeing this 2017 adaptation, I just had to read the novel too.  Murder on the Orient Express is well-plotted, fast-paced and very entertaining. The famous detective, Hercule Poirot, finds himself called to London and boards the crowded Orient Express. On its second night, the train is stopped in its tracks by a snowdrift. By morning, a man lies dead in his compartment, stabbed a dozen times, his door locked from the inside. Only one thing is sure: the killer is still on the train. The crime seems unsolvable, even for Poirot. So watching him as he interviews all those in the train car, then as he sits back to ponder all that he has seen and heard, is a real treat. My favorite part about the whole book was how logical everything is and how well it all flows. Poirot's problem solving process feels like a professor walking you through a complex lecture, breaking everything down step by step, until the perfect solution is found.I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading a good mystery."

That said I still thoroughly enjoyed the story and especially the build up to the denouement.I really enjoyed the structure of the book, with all the evidence taken through the middle of the book, giving the amateur detective the same chance as Poirot to solve the problem. The thinking of his two colleagues when they muse over the evidence is just priceless. This almost made the magical 5 stars, but my experience of the films has lead me to give it just 4, unfair I know, but its my review ha ha.All in all a fab read and that means that I have (almost) finished the Poirot challenge for this year."

Напълно заслужено се е превърнала в една от най-популярните творби на Агата Кристи, тъй като е не само заплетено криминале, но и предизвикваща размисли за справедливостта и човешките взаимоотношения история! На прочутия „Ориент Експрес“ е убит американец, пътуващ под фалшива самоличност. Сред пътниците във влака случайно се оказва и Еркюл Поаро, затова на него се пада задачата да разпита останалите и разкрие изключително загадъчния случай...„— Мислите, че един английски разпит не би бил проведен по този начин. Там всичко би било както си му е редът, всички биха се придържали към фактите — би била една добре организирана работа. Но аз, мадмоазел, си имам моите малки оригиналности. Първо оглеждам свидетеля, определям характера му и съставям въпросите си в зависимост от това. Преди малко разпитах един господин, който искаше да ми каже какво мисли за всяко нещо. Него например го връщах винаги точно на въпроса. Исках да ми отговаря с да или не, така или иначе. А след това идвате вие. Веднага виждам, че ще бъдете методична и ще се придържате към известен ред. Ще се ограничите с разискваните въпроси. Вашите отговори ще бъдат кратки и по същество. И понеже, мадмоазел, човешката природа е каприз��а, аз ви задавам съвсем различни въпроси.“ „— Не ви ли се струва, че вдигате много шум за нищо, мосьо Поаро?  Поаро разпери ръце в извинителен жест.  — Това може би е наша грешка, на детективите. Очакваме държането винаги да бъде последователно. Не признаваме промените на настроението.“ „Бук поклати глава. Мислите му се занимаваха с изумителните разкрития през току-що изминалия половин час. Той измърмори:  — Лъжи… и пак лъжи… Поразен съм от количеството лъжи, които ни се казаха тази сутрин.  — Остават още лъжи за разкриване — подхвърли весело Поаро.  — Така ли мислите?  — Ще се разочаровам много, ако не е така.“"

So I opted for Murder On The Orient Express, which has spawned several movie, TV and radio adaptions, and I wasn't disappointed.After getting used to some of the old fashioned way of writing (it was wrote in the 1930s after all), the story was easy to get into and soon had me quickly turning the pages to get to the bottom of it all.As Hercule Poirot boards the Taurus Express from Syria to Istanbul, he receives an important telegram urging him to return to London, through his friend, Monsieur Bouc, he manages to book himself into the Orient Express carriage.As he familiarises himself with the carriage and the passengers on the carriage, he is immediately repulsed by an American passenger named Ratchet, though he can't quite figure out why, he immediately takes a dislike to the man, and it emerges he is not the only one, as Ratchet approaches Poirot with an offer, claiming someone is out to kill him, Poirot dismisses his generous offer, telling Ratchet he doesn't like the man's face. Soon enough, Ratchet is found dead in his carriage, murdered by several stab wounds, Poirot, aided by his friend, M.Bouc immediately tries to figure out the person/persons responsible, as it appears there may have been more than one responsible.It emerges that the other dozen or so passengers are responsible and that the killer is still on the train, Poirot immediately begins his investigation and sets about interrogating the passengers. The dozen or so passengers all vary, many different nationalities and personalities and it soon turns out their may be more to this case than meets the eye, who was this Ratchet and why was someone out to kill him.This was a very entertaining read, and I can see why its so highly regarded by many in this type of genre, me myself I didn't see the ending coming (a great detective I am not😂) but looking back there were the clues in place, I definitely recommend this, and am very interested in seeing one of the movie/TV adaptations of this to see how well it holds up, and will definitely check out more of Agatha Christie's work.⭐⭐⭐⭐1/3 Stars, strong recommendation."
83,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76463472-thibault-busschots,Rating 5 out of 5,"While aboard the famous Orient Express, detective Hercule Poirot is approached by American businessman Samuel Ratchett. Ratchett has been receiving death threats. Fearing for his life, he seeks to employ Poirot for his own protection. Poirot feels repulsed by Ratchett, so he turns the man down. Not long after, Ratchett is found dead.Since the train is caught in a snowdrift, the murderer can’t have escaped the train. And it will take a while before the local police can get to the scene of the crime. So Poirot interrogates all the possible suspects and investigates all the evidence he can find. But it’s clear there’s something strange about the evidence left at the scene of the crime.The guest characters are interesting enough to work with the plot, but it’s Poirot who really shines here. From the way he describes Ratchett in the beginning of the book to the way he solves the case, by putting his little grey cells to work. In this book, Poirot’s fascination with human psychology in particular is fully on display. The murder mystery plot is of course absolutely brilliant. And it’s interesting to note that it’s partly inspired by an actual crime.The historic and atmospheric setting of the Orient Express is but the icing on the cake. And the train being caught in a snowdrift, isolating it from the rest of the world, makes us aware from the get go that the murderer is undoubtedly lurking among the cast of characters we meet. He or she is trying to set Poirot and us on the wrong foot every step of the way. And that’s what makes the interrogation scenes even more compelling.Murder on the Orient Express is simply put one of Agatha Christie’s most famous novels, if not the most famous. And it’s absolutely worth the hype. I’d already seen a few movies based on this story. I saw the episode of the brilliant TV series with David Suchet. I even saw this story in the theatre a couple of years ago. I came to this book already knowing the story by heart. And it still managed to grab me from start to finish. That’s how you know that this story is something special. If you’re new to Agatha Christie and you don’t know which book to try first, you really can’t go wrong with this one."

That is all I have done.”Monsieur Poirot is full of nuggets of wisdom like that, often leaving his listeners completely nonplussed.I recently saw the  trailer for the 2017 adaptation  of Murder on the Orient Express, and I figured now may be a good time to reread this book, which I first read decades ago. I recently said in my  The Moonstone review that knowing the solution to a murder mystery tend to substantially reduce the entertainment value of the book. I remembered the denouement of  The Moonstone very well because it is so outrageous. The same can be said for Murder on the Orient Express, Ms Christie’s solution is equally outrageous. However, this book has some advantages over  The Moonstone.  The Moonstone is often cited as being the prototype detective novel, by the time Murder on the Orient Express came along Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie and other others have also refined the genre into a fine and very popular art. Ms Christie’s secret weapon is her ace detective Hercule Poirot, “a little man with enormous moustaches” and an egg-shaped head.  Kenneth Branagh as Poirot, not so little, no egg-shaped head, and the moustache is unfeasibly enormous.The plot of Murder on the Orient Express is wonderfully simple. The famous Orient Express train travelling from Stamboul (Istanbul) to Calais and beyond, runs into a snowdrift and has to stop until the track is cleared. During this long stoppage a passenger is murdered, he apparently died from a dozen stab wounds. Poirot is assisted in his investigation by his pal M. Bouc and Dr Constantine, both of whom are of course completely flummoxed by the seeming impossibility of the crime under the circumstances. Poirot questions the numerous suspects extensively. “Ma foi!” but they are all full of BS that has to be sifted through. After he is done with badgering the passengers he kicks back to do some awesome contemplation (no mention of a “mind palace”), his little grey cells going into overdrive.Poirot is not nearly as cool as Sherlock (I cannot imagine Benedict Crumblebuns as Poirot) but he is very endearing. His methods seem to rely less on forensic evidence than on badgering the suspects until they give themselves away; a technique that may have inspired the eccentric detective  Columbo. Christie’s characterization is interesting, there are not lot nuances in the characters, most of them are amusing caricatures of archetypes, like the repressed Brits, the loquacious Italian, the swaggering American, the stern Russian etc. Even Poirot is something of a cartoon, with his small stature, egg-shaped head, gigantic moustaches and distinctive rendition of the English language, not to mention that certain “Je ne sais qui” thing he has going.Pristine, practically perfect Poirot, David SuchetIf this sounds like criticism it is not really, I find Christie’s narrative very charming, witty, entertaining, and cosy of course. It has a lovely old school sort of appeal, I love how much Poirot enjoys solving crimes and is always so upbeat. Her plotting, planting of red herrings and generally teasing her readers with misleading info is masterful. These elements are why her fiction is still enduring almost a century later. What I did not notice before when I read her books as a teenager is how she is also often subtly satirical, sending up various kinds of people. I also appreciate that her novels are mostly of moderate length so that she never outstays her welcome.If you never read Agatha Christie start with this one or  And Then There Were None. If you have read her before years ago and think her stuff is old hat now, try the hat on again for size. Great hats never go out of fashion 😉Notes:• Christie’s other ace detective,  Miss Marple, has even more unlikely methods, entirely based on observation or something.• Major spoiler discussion: I do find the ending of this book morally dubious. Poirot allows the twelve murderers to get away with their crime after he has worked out their intricate plot and motivation because the victim is a murderer of little kids. Was Christie advocating vigilantism?Quotes:“That, to me, is the interest of this case,” he said. “We are cut off from all the normal routes of procedure. Are these people whose evidence we have taken speaking the truth, or lying? We have no means of finding out-except such means as we can devise ourselves. It is an exercise, this, of the brain.”“I like to see an angry Englishman,” said Poirot. “They are very amusing. The more emotional they feel, the less command they have of language.”“Ma foi!” said M. Bouc with violence. “But does everybody on this train tell lies?”“His eyes rested for a moment on Hercule Poirot, but they passed on indifferently. Poirot, reading the English mind correctly, knew that he had said to himself. “Only some damned foreigner.”Peter Ustinov was a fun, upsized Poirot. Alfred Molina as Poirot in a (bad) 2001 adaptation."

I honestly don't understand the high ratings. I mean, did I miss something?!The premise was okay. I just feel like it would have perhaps been better served as a short story. Overall I found the book formulaic and boring, and I didn't give a foop about a single one of the characters."

This was such a fun read. I absolutely loved the structure of the tree parts with the facts, evidence and conclusion. It made it so easy to follow and constantly kept you thinking and guessing. It also meant you got to meet and experience the interrogation of each character and suspect in depth. I loved all of the characters and the fact that I didn't predict the conclusion until much later on (and still found myself second guessing my suspicions) was the best experience. This was exactly the classic murder mystery read I've been told to read for years and I now understand why. I can't wait to read more of Christies work as soon as possible. (I'm also so ready for the new movie adaptation!) "

Now that I know who dunnit I'm not going to tell you, but rather let you suffer through the torment of not knowing, the embarrassment of thinking your guess must be correct only to find you are WRONG! You are wrong because Poirot and the woman who created him are both smarter than you. Suck it, that's just the way it is. It's a truth as true in 1934 as it is today. Christie is synonymous with clever. Her plot constructions will out-wit the pants right off you...if her characters haven't already charmed them off."

After successfully aiding a French army general in Syria, Poirot plans to return home to England after a brief stay in Stamboul (Istanbul today). Due to a business need, he cancels his Stamboul visit and books passage on the Simplon Orient with the assistance of his fellow Belgian and friend Monsieur Bouc, who is a director of the train company. In his carriage, he finds an unusual variety of social classes and nationalities despite winter being typically a slow season for travel. During the second night on the train, the train’s passage is blocked by snow around Vincovci (modern-day Croatia but Yugoslavia then) and an American named Ratchett is stabbed 12 times and dies. Bouc appeals to Poirot to solve the murder so that a fait accompli could be presented to the local authorities and delays could be further avoided. Bouc persuades his old friend to “lie back and think - use the little grey cells of the mind - and you will know!” MotOE is laid out in a logical manner and divided into 3 parts labeled respectively, “The Facts,” “The Evidence,” and finally “Hercule Poirot Sits Back and Thinks.”

The impossible could not have happened, therefore the impossible must be possible in spite of appearances.

Full disclosure time - this book was published in 1934 and there’s been a great deal of exposure for this story. I have read all of the Poirot mysteries, but since it has been more than 10 years, I believed that enough time has elapsed to warrant a re-read. I have also seen at least 3 of the 4 film adaptations of MotOE. Given that I still recall the identity of the killer, I approached this differently. I paid attention to the details and tried to determine whether I could solve this mystery with the clues Agatha Christie had provided. The verdict is no. If you managed to do so, more power to you. [Perhaps you are like one character to whom Poirot says, “You have… the makings of a very fine criminal… a great natural ingenuity, and an apparently remorseless determination to mislead justice.” 😉] This story was written in a spare fashion, so I didn’t have the benefits of seeing facial expressions and other body language twitches during the interviews with the suspects. Christie also buried her one-sentence clues deep into the narrative. Poirot’s suspicions were raised by one clue which required a visual that was not described by Christie. Finally, Poirot had made a large instinctive leap of logic that I couldn’t allow myself in all fairness given that I already knew the ending. 

I am not one to rely upon the expert procedure. It is the psychology I seek, not the fingerprint or the cigarette ash.

I like Hercule Poirot, as evidenced by the fact that I have read all 30-odd stories. Christie had created a very insightful, perceptive detective, which I could see by how he tailored his interrogation style to suit the temperament of his current witness. (Poirot appeared more arrogant in the later books and definitely in David Suchet’s interpretation). His leaps of mental connection weren’t always apparent to the reader as he made them, so we are like Bouc in that aspect. Examples include Poirot’s guess that Schmidt was really a cook instead of a lady’s maid and Hardman’s involvement was due to being in love with Daisy Armstrong’s nanny.But in looking at the details so closely, I only found two flaws in an otherwise flawless puzzle.  The first is a breach of logic. Poirot observed that Ratchett was on guard because he had slept with a gun under his pillow. If that’s true, then how could Greta Ohlsson open his door to his surprise while she was really searching for Mrs. Hubbard’s compartment unless it was unlocked? In addition, how could Mrs. Hubbard let her in since she claimed to be lying in bed the entire time unless her compartment had been left unlocked as well? And yet, Mrs. Hubbard was concerned whether the connecting door was locked? The second and lesser point is that we’re given 3 different first names for Daisy Armstrong’s father. Colonel Arbuthnot called him “Toby” to Poirot and then agreed with Mrs. Hubbard that “John” had saved his life in the war. Then there’s another family member who called Daisy’s father “Robert.” How is the reader to figure everything out when someone has 3 different first names.Despite my observations, MotOE deserves its place as a classic written during the golden age of detective fiction. Why didn’t I give this 5 stars then? It truly was a mental exercise and a bit sterile - just look at her labeling of the book’s parts. Christie included these destinations (ex. the book starts in Aleppo) that are exotic given current geo-political events, but she didn’t flesh them out with her real life experiences. In that regard, this story could have taken place on a train in England as long as the passengers were confined for an equal period of time. What MotOE lacked in creating a sense of place though, it compensated with its depiction of a particular part of history. The book was published in 1934, when many countries were just beginning to recover from the Great Depression. The $200,000 ransom paid by the Armstrongs would be equivalent to $3 to $7 million in today’s dollars, depending on which inflation calculator you’d like to believe. But what really struck me was how frequently and extensively the ethnic and national stereotyping occurred amongst the characters. The English and the Americans, presumably Christie’s biggest target readership, were both insulted and praised in equal measures. The other nationalities didn’t receive similar treatment as the Italians were looked down upon by three other nationalities. Poirot and the Hungarian Count were immediately dismissed by the English just because they were “foreign” to them. It is no wonder that world wars occurred before and after this novel was published. One last, possibly, ironic note by Christie: responding to Poirot’s tale of Daisy’s kidnapping, Frau Schmidt exclaimed, “We are not so wicked in Germany!” The German Reich was formed in 1933, and Hitler became the Fuhrer in 1934.Finally, the ending was a bit abrupt. Poirot solved the mystery and Monsieur Bouc, as his client, was the judge. Crime fiction is popular because readers like to see justice triumph. But in this story, with that abrupt ending, Poirot comes across as empathetic, yes because he had provided his preferred solution first, but also a bit distant like any professional solving a problem. In this regard, I preferred the film adaptations of MotOE with David Suchet as the best Hercule Poirot. I did think that it was a bit of an extra interpretation by Suchet for him to discuss his Catholic faith in that final scene, but it did increase the emotional tension of the film."

Walking along the beach path I overhear bits and pieces of other conversations and last week was one of those magical days. Two young women were walking together when one asked the other, ""Have you ever read Agatha Christie? My favorite teacher - 7th grade English- turned us on to her. She is so amazing. I'm reading Murder on the Orient ExpreSs..."" And then muffled words and the young women outpaced us. I was willing to jog to keep up with the conversation but my husband would have none of that nonsense. What do I love so about this story? I love the setting on the train - that closed environment. I love the way my mind is forced to see new connections between the characters. Christies structure is like watching a magician on stage when you have some knowledge of magic yourself...you admire the sleight of hand and wonder how she pulls it off so smoothly.

This was my first Agatha Christie book and I devoured it.What I love about this book is the tension between the characters and the sole mystery of who killed whom. I think that the author was successful in making this mystery novel so gripping and mind-twisting. I honestly can't put it down because my mind is making different guesses on how the murder was done and who had done it. To be honest, my brain cells was pushed to its limits because of this book.

A Full Five Stars:✰✰✰✰✰
 I really don't like over-hyping books (unless I'm talking about Sanderson.... then yes I will absolutely over hype it haha), so keep in mind that I usually try to rate books according to the genre they are in. Different genres hand themselves to different means of being rated. Like... I would never take a star off of a Sci-fi novel for not having a magic system, because magic has very little to do with the Sci-fi genre haha. As a mystery, certain components that I normally look for in a book just aren't as important for this genre.With that being said, this is absolutely a five star mystery. No, this is NOT a thriller, and it is NOT a drama. I feel like it's really important to temper those expectations, and I can't emphasize it enough, because if that's what you are looking for in this book, you will probably be disappointed. This is, plain and simple, a good ole' fashioned mystery, and among the best of its kind. As I read this book, I couldn't help but think about all of the other mystery-type books that I've read, and even all of the crime and murder related TV Shows I have watched. My mind was drawn towards thinking about those, because quite literally, the plots and ideas and writing behind those books and TV Shows seem completely pedestrian next to Agatha Christie's. There is a reason she is the best selling author of all time - beaten only by the Bible and Shakespeare (who was a playwright). It's because you need the mind of a genius to write a book like this one, in all of its complexity and misdirection and minute detail. Christie writes in such a way that makes you feel like you are right by Hercule Poirot's side as he processes every clue, every interview, every little piece of information. It almost feels like a race as you try to piece everything together in your own head, thinking you might be able to solve the mystery on your own, only to have those hopes dashed against the rocks of Poirot's brilliant mind (which is essentially credited to the author's brilliance, as well). I can't tell you how many times I thought I had it figured out. And then I reached the last few chapters.... My mind was completely blown, because I DID NOT in any way whatsoever see that conclusion coming, among all of my meandering predictions of who committed the murder. I put the book down and felt like I had been cheated for my entire life by all of the weak mysteries I've read, because this book is everything that a mystery should be, and illustrates perfection in all of the areas that mysteries normally fail. All packed into a relatively small novel, making for a great before-bed kind of book. It was compelling to read, which I was not expecting, considering the fact that they never leave the train. In spite of the bland setting though, this book kept me interested and invested the entire time. This was my first Christie novel, but I can tell you for certain it will not be my last. I can't believe I've never read any of her books, and I'm kicking myself for not getting to these sooner. She has made a life long fan of me for sure - I can only hope her other books live up to this same standard of excellence. Adding this to my list of favorites for sure =]."

A Poirot novel par excellence. It has the best elements of a good Christie: a confined setting, a large cast of interesting and suspicious characters, and of course, Hercule Poirot.This is the type of mystery you can enjoy time and again, even after you know the solution to the case, you can still read it and observe the way the investigation unfolds. I was highly amused by the way in which everyone outside of Britain is presented by British characters as 'exotic' (that whole thing about Italians had me cracking up, and I'm Italian).Plus, I always appreciate a  crime of passion.

Para nada. Me remito a una cosa en específico que para mí (como lector de la reina del crimen), es muy necesaria en medio de sus páginas. Esto se resume en lo  adictivo  que puede o no resultar la trama. Admito que al principio traía buena pinta y que esta prometía demasiado pero mi atención se fue diluyendo poco a poco;  producto de la gran cantidad de sospechosos que había dentro del crimen,  siendo demasiados como para despertarme un genuino interés. Los libros de Agatha no son extensos y por lo tanto,  no hay espacio para el correcto desarrollo y caracterización de los distintos personajes.  Se podría decir que estos apenas llegan a ser un bosquejo. En fin, que no son tridimensionales y aquí, justo en este libro se nota aun más esa falencia ya que no es fácil distinguir un personaje de otro. Diferenciarlos se hace una tarea difícil, más no imposible pero si aburridora.El libro no llegó a emocionarme ni a generar esas ansias vivas de llegar al desenlace. Es solamente un Poirot recogiendo pistas y haciendo preguntas a todos los sospechosos, hasta que se llega a una exahustiva reflexión de toda la información recolectada. El final, pues sí, es sorprendente. Como siempre. Aunque no tanto como esperaba. La experiencia ha sido agridulce porque aunque es un libro famosísimo hay otros que considero mejores de la escritora.

Its magnificent, exceptional, unexpected, brilliant. I am in awe. Initially, I only intended to read a few chapters but ended up reading the whole book in one sit. With a variety of intriguing characters and an elegant train wagon, Christie transports the reader to a different time and era. As more clues unravel and motivations come to light, suspicion passes from one passenger to the next like a hot potato. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I gotta say I did not see that ending coming AT ALL. Its no wonder how the Great Dame of mystery still is quite popular today.

While it didn't steal the #1 spot for me from And Then There Were None and Death on the Nile, it maneuvered its way into #3.Ah, Poirot. He may think he's retired, but he keeps running into murders on his travels. This time he's come from an emotional upheaval and needs the break, after being saddened by a friend's death, but once on the train he sees it's no peaceful vacation. Murder takes place, but the clues are so obvious it's clear they were planted. Not only obvious, but they point the fingers at several and contradict each other. Murder on the Orient Express was refreshing for a Christie book because she took a break from her straight-laced justice chase for once. It showed a different side to the understanding Poirot has, something he usually doesn't do or get involved in. The ending delivered a unique twist that comes back to a personal situation with Poirot in the beginning. How she ties these tiny knots together to make the rope so complex always surprises me.Even though it's about a crime, a few sentences of humor are introduced, mainly when Poirot's mustache battles his soup and an overbearing character who won't shut up. Usually a suspect needs detailed interviewing, but this is one woman they're happy to get out of the interrogation chambers. Besides that, his two companions were a lot of fun since they suspected pretty much everybody after each questioning. How Poirot has patience with us and our little minds, I'll never know. :)The mystery is hard to solve without Poirot's genius observations, but it's still neat to see how it plays out when he reveals his hand. Again I loved the ending focusing on justice in such a different sort of way. The irony with the numbers is genius too - those little touches make all the difference between a good story and a great one.One of the contradictions on the train was a clear-standing prejudice of travelers of different nationalities holding their personal prejudices against ""foreigners."" It comes across more funny than anything, although some may itch to get offended, as silly as I think that is.On the negative side, the book was mainly just interviews and not red herrings or different discoveries and explorations - sitting for hours talking isn't as exciting as the different trials on the ship with 'Death On the Nile' and the claustrophobic tightness of 'And Then There Were None.'"

Μετά πήρα τηλέφωνο το καλό μου, του είπα τον δολοφόνο και ανέλυσα το σκεπτικό μου, τότε ήρθε η απάντησή του, «Μήπως είχες δει κάποτε την ταινία;» Ψάχτηκα λίγο και θυμήθηκα ότι κάπου, κάποτε, σε πολύ μικρή ηλικία την είχα δει.

Perhaps one of Agatha Christie’s most popular books in the Hercule Poirot series, this is one novel I have been eager to reach in my exploration of the collection. Christie excels in this story, offering a deeper and more complex mystery that keeps the reader on the edge of their seats. I can see why it got so much hype, as it is well well written and offers the reader an in-depth look into the analytical brain of Poirot. If there are other books int he series of this caliber, I am eager to find them, as Christie had me from the opening paragraph.As the Orient Express makes its way across Europe, a snowstorm creates havoc. The passenger train, full of people from all over the world, is stuck in the Balkans with no clear guarantee of moving anytime. By morning, the luxury liner has more than snow to contend with, as Samuel Edward Ratchett is found murdered in his private compartment. While many of the passengers are in a panic, one of them is ready to lend an hand to find the murderer. Hercule Poirot is on holiday, having hoped to enjoy his trip from Istanbul to London.The narrative develops and the reader learns much about the victim, many of the suspects (surely, it has to be one of the passengers), and the clues that Poirot is able to deduce throughout the investigation. Ratchett was not a popular man, having been responsible for a crime back in America. All that being said, there is surely a deeper motive for at least one of the suspects aboard the Orient Express.By the latter portion o the novel, Poirot is narrowing the list of potential killers and runs through some of the suspects a second time. He is almost ready to finger someone, but a twist in the tale takes things in a new direction and leaves the reader gasping by the end. Who killed Samuel Edward Ratchett and for what reason? All will be revealed in time, though some will surely wish the story could have gone on forever, with its gripping aspects. Agatha Christie at her best!The series finds new ways off getting better with each passing novel and I cannot devour them fast enough. Poirot makes a wonderful impact yet again as the narrative flows with ease. I would say that this was my favourite book to date, pulling on all the best parts of a mystery novel and keeps the reader guessing until the final page turn. I cannot wait to see what is to come in this sensational series.Poirot shows how great a character he is and presents himself in top form throughout the book. His ego, while usually front and centre, appeared to be somewhat muted, which made for a more enjoyable read. With little backstory on which to base the character, Poirot lives in the present and uses his interactions to add depth to his personality. His sleuthing in this piece is some of the best and most on point, leaving me to hope there are more like this to come.Christie delivers her most sensational novel to date, providing readers with a stunning mystery, well worth the praise it has received over the years. Christie’s writing is free from the extemporaneous details found in many books that supersaturated the genre to date. Strong narrative aspects provide a strong foundation for a novel that has so much going for it. Wonderful characters prove to be the cornerstone of this piece, which is full of personalities that will either impress or anger the reader. I could not get enough of the plot twists and surprise ending. I cannot wait to get my hands on a movie version of this to see how it compares. I’ll take a short break from Poirot, but will return, energized and ready for more!Kudos, Dame Christie, for your most intense novel to date. I am super impressed.Love/hate the review?

115,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48056505-piyangie,Rating 4 out of 5,"When I started with this read, I had some difficulty in connecting with it; something I have not experienced with my previous reads of the Poirot series. I was a little disappointed as to why it is so since this is said to be one of her best works. I think it all had to do with the structure of the story and the way it was presented which I felt to be quite different from the previous reads of the series. While perhaps it gives more order to the flow of the story, it also found me mechanically reading the first third of the book with no real interest. From there onward, however, the story picked up its pace keeping me well engaged and building my interest in the story till the very end.On an overall reflection, Murder on the Orient Express is another ingenious murder mystery by Agatha Christie. The story is based on a complex plot and Christie takes us through a difficult guessing game. Although I wasn't engaged with the story as I ought to be at the beginning, once the outline was laid and the story picked up, I found myself engaged eagerly in the guessing game. Poirot shines here, with his ""little grey cells"" working their magic. It is his expertise, long experience, and, of course, the brilliant analytical mind that sees him through the tangled evidence to unravel the mystery behind the murder. Overall I felt that this was one of the stories where Poirot was in his best element. And that ending! I was completely knocked off. It is quite different from what I have come across in a Poirot story so far. And I feel I should say a few words about it. First, I never expected that outcome! As I said, it really took me by surprise. Second, I was more surprised by Poirot's actions. He proved not only to be a brilliant detective but also to be a humane soul who believes that justice does not always find in strict rules and procedures. Well done Poirot! I love your human heart. "

This was really great. I admire how this novel was structured, it was split into three main parts: the crime, the interrogations, and the solution. Christie's writing is really clear and easy to read, she writes in non-complicated English with which nobody should have trouble. She also never strays from the plot. Every single sentence has something to do with the case (which is quite impressive). I didn't know the solution to this case but it really did shock and impress me. Everything made sense and it was all wrapped up with no loose ends. I think I'm going to read two of these a month now because they are just so good!"

This recent movie adaptation directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh, was a most pleasurable experience. After being thoroughly mesmerised by the film adaptation of Murder on the Orient Express, I felt compelled to read the book. I devoured this book and I can safely say Murder on the Orient Express is my favourite Agatha Christie novel, to date.First published in 1934, Murder on the Orient Express features Agatha Christie’s Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot. Hercule Poirot finds himself on a train journey that abruptly comes to a standstill, due to a snowdrift. As this luxury train, full of passengers awaits help, a deadly discovery is made. A passenger, a wealthy American magnate, has been found deceased in his cabin. What is striking about this case is that the dead man is covered in a frenzy of knife wounds. With the door and the cabin locked, it can only mean one thing, there is a killer loose on the train. It is up to seasoned detective Hercule Poirot to identify and help apprehend the murderer, before it’s too late and they take the opportunity to kill again.Murder on the Orient Express has been touted as ‘undoubtedly one of Agatha Christie’s greatest mystery novels’. Although I don’t have a large collection to compare this novel against, having only read a handful of Christie’s novels, there is something about this book that spoke to me. Murder on the Orient Express screams classic mystery novel. I am sure many of the mystery novelists of today could learn a thing or two from the queen of crime mystery novels.So why am I singing the praises of this novel? Well, a number of factors. First up, I found the plot interesting, involving and downright puzzling. It was a great move by Christie to cast everyone on that fateful train as a suspect. The mystery element of this book is presented very well, it had me guessing and second guessing, thanks to Christie’s red herrings and plot diversions. The character set is something else, they are a real mixed bunch. It is quite a big cast, but each of these well rendered characters contributes to the unfolding events of the novel.I didn’t really take to the character of detective Hercule Poirot in the previous books I have read by Agatha Christie, featuring this well know character. However, Murder on the Orient Express allowed me to see Poirot in a different light. I developed quite an affection for this lead. I came to love his little quirks and musings as the novel progressed. I can now see why Poirot has remained an enduring feature of Christie’s novels for so long. I also liked the particular case presented in this novel, as it challenged the core morals of the lead.For me, the wow factor in this novel (and in the film version) was the setting. This is a novel that I can truly say I was able to sit back and thoroughly enjoy the ride. It was such an adventure stepping on board this luxury train from days gone by. I imagined myself embarking on a glamorous and eventful journey across Europe. I loved the snow filled and cold atmosphere depicted by Christie. I also felt the strong sense of confinement created by Christie on board this train. It was intense and superbly portrayed.Murder on the Orient Express is a book that I believe confirms Agatha Christie’s place as a crackerjack of the classic crime mystery genre. With the presence of plenty of feature elements that make this novel tick, from a full bodied character list, a spectacular locale, a stifling atmosphere and a complex crime at its heart, Murder on the Orient Express was an absolute pleasure to read. This book is Agatha Christie at her best."

4.25/5 Stars
This was such a fun story!This is my second venture into the world of Agatha Christie. The other novel I read by her was And Then There Were None, which I loved, and I think I may like this one even more!This story is literally so perfect for winter! A classic ""whodunnit"" story set in a confined area of a train that is at a stand-still due to the snow. What could go wrong?I really enjoyed Hercule Poirot's character. I'm not one to lean towards detectives or even detective stories in general, but his character is fantastic. My praise for his character is mostly due Christie's writing skills as well as Dan Stevens' FANTASTIC performance. That's another thing that made this book great: Dan Stevens' narration is next level!Not going to lie, that ending kind of snuck up on me. I had some theories but when the reveal came, I was shocked! The only thing that deterred this from being a 5 Star read is because of the intricacies of analyzing the evidence. By the end of the book, everything made sense, but it was how we got there that confused me just a tad. Maybe it was because I wasn't paying too much attention to it and was just having fun? I don't know.Anyways, this book was great. Christie has shown that she truly knew her stuff when it came down to constructing a mystery novel. Can't wait to pick up more from her!"

132,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/903390-werner,Rating 5 out of 5,"Agatha Christie is justly regarded as the grande dame of the traditional Anglo-American mystery in the period between the World Wars. Both fans and critics of writings in this genre from that time agree that, on the whole, whatever their merits, these novels usually do tend to follow a rather predictable, formulaic plot structure, and tend to be purely intellectual puzzles or entertaining stories which don't grapple with serious moral or philosophical questions. But neither of those generalizations apply to this book! That accounts for my five-star rating; and probably also has something to do with why this ranks as one of Christie's better-known works. (There have been at least two movie adaptations.)As noted above, this ""locked-room"" mystery is the tenth of Christie's novels to feature her best-known series sleuth, Hercule Poirot, whose ""little grey cells"" will get a real workout here. (The Poirot novels and stories don't have to be read in order; the protagonist's character doesn't develop over time, and his life circumstances don't change in any significant ways.) The circumstances of the case makes the pool of suspects definite and limited, and nobody involved is going anywhere any time soon. But this is offset by a bewildering array of contradictory clues and physical evidence; readers of mystery fiction usually like to try to solve the case along with the detective, but to do that here, you'll have to really think outside the box. (And even though the train may be stalled, you're in for quite a thrill ride of successive surprising revelations!) This novel had, for me, more of a period feel than some of Christie's other novels; and she exhibits a real talent for delineating character traits with small details. (The deftly-pegged prejudices of some of the characters, and one American's casual use of the term ""Wop,"" tell us more about their attitudes than about Christie's.) Traveling solo as he is here, Poirot doesn't have his usual foil, Captain Hastings; but Christie provides him with two others, a French acquaintance who's a director of the railroad line and a Greek medical doctor.This is a masterpiece of the mystery genre, with an ending that may leave you sitting back and saying, ""Wow!"" Highly recommended!"

instagram6.21/10What a way to start 2021! I didn't expect much from Murder on the Orient Express. It's (only) my second Agatha Christie book, and I'm amazed. In complete awe. While I knew nothing of the story before reading it, which is a miracle in and of itself, what I found most remarkable, is that I didn't assemble the pieces of the story myself until the very end. The way Christie crafted this novel is marvellous. She manages in less than 300 hundred pages introduce a humourous tightly knotted tapestry with distinct characters, and I think a lot of current mystery writers could use some of the literary devices she used in here because this is a masterclass.The only weak point of this book might be the lack of a distinct and mysterious atmosphere which could have made this story an even more engaging read. Since the story is a locked-room mystery taking place on a train stuck in the snow, I longed to feel the snow, and smell the coal of the train. To summarize, Murder on the Orient Express is one of the best mystery books I've read. It has a captivating plot, a diverse set of characters (or suspects,) but finds its Achilles' heel in its atmosphere. I can't wait to dive more into Christie's bibliography this year."
134,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"Well, after many years I have finally read an Agatha Christie mystery. My overly persuasive husband prodded me into reading it because he thought that since I was a mystery lover I had to read one of the most prolific mystery writers of all time. I read it in two days. It is a very easy read that carries the reader effortlessly into each chapter and section. The characters are somewhat intriguing and from varied international backgrounds which definitely heightened the sense of mystery. It is the first book I have read that takes place, for the most part, on an stationary train (the orient express) in the dead of winter. I appreciated the suspense, the author's irony and sense of humor, but it lacked depth or any meaning beyond a mystery. However, maybe that is all Christie was trying to deliver: a beautifully written mystery and nothing more? Still, I struggled with rating it in the same category as the great books I have read and so I rated it against the greatest mystery I have ever read: The Women In White by Wilkie Collins. All in all, it held my attention, made me chuckle and even though I suspected the true killer(s) identity all along I was pleasantly surprised with the way it unfolded."

140,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1232712-matt,Rating 4 out of 5,"I’m not a mystery reader. I’m just a guy with a 2 year-old who won’t go to sleep and who won’t stay asleep. Usually, I read history or biographies. But I needed something a bit lighter for those long dark hours of the night. Thus, I went to my ever-expanding shelf of unread books and grabbed Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express, which I’d purchased I-don’t-know-how-long-ago on a whim I can’t recall. The title tells you just about everything you need to know about the plot. A group of passengers board the Orient Express in Istanbul. At the time, all of them are alive. On the second night of the journey, the train is stopped by a snowdrift. Also, the condition of one of the passengers is downgraded from living to dead. Coincidentally, the internationally-famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is aboard to solve the mystery. Oh, and did I mention: Everyone is a suspect! (Side note: At no point does anyone stop to think that Poirot might be the murderer. This book is written in the third-person limited perspective, so we are never really given a true accounting of his actions on the fateful night. I became slightly obsessed with the notion. What if he did it!? His room, after all, is right next to the deceased. I started to muse on how it would’ve been totally dope if Agatha Christie, in her last Poirot book, revealed that Poirot was actually a fiendish serial killer who’d committed every murder himself. I recognize that this is a bit sacrilegious, that there are a lot of Poirot-shippers out there. So be it. These are the things I ponder when my daughter is building a pillow nest for herself at 3:00 a.m.).The book is written like a legal brief, with short chapters detailing Poirot’s investigation. It is broken up into three parts. Part One covers the setup, introducing the characters on the train. Chief among them is our diminutive hero, “a small lean man, muffled up to the ears” with a “pink-tipped nose and the two points of an upward curled moustache.” It ends with the knife-murder of one of the passengers. I feel compelled to interject here that Christie is oddly blasé about the physical reality of a homicide committed by a knife. The crime-scene is, in her telling, strangely antiseptic. You get no sense of how grisly it should have been, walls and floor and ceiling covered in blood. The corpse is quickly forgotten. There were times I wondered, as things progressed, What about the smell? Part Two’s chapters are devoted to the evidence given by each of the passengers and crew, derived from Poirot’s sly questioning. There is a chapter apiece as each person meets with Poirot’s unconventionally particularized interrogation. Part Three covers Poirot’s deductive reasoning, and ends with his dramatic reveal of the culprit in front of everyone. Just like in real life! (Sorry. I'm not trying to be a fun-hater. I get that the central conceit of mysteries are (1) that they are solvable by intellect alone and (2) they exist in an alternate, perhaps parallel universe where someone's death is important mainly as a cerebral exercise). Like I said, this is my first Christie mystery, so I’m speaking out of my butt rather from any experience. I’m assuming, though, that this is the standard formula. At least, this read formulaically. Christie wastes very little time with setting or character-building, but jumps right into the thick of things. This is a bit disappointing. Going in, I was fascinated by the exotic setting: interwar international travel on a first-class train. Christie doesn’t do much to create atmosphere and her descriptions are bare-bones. She was a mystery writer, distilled to the essence. And I can appreciate that. This wasn't a fun read for me, per se. Part of that was my own personal context of reading this next to a child sent from the underworld to stay awake, always. Partially it's that mysteries are just not my thing. That said, the experience of reading this was almost comforting. I didn't sense any true tension, and I certainly did not feel anything for any of the characters, none of whom transcend their roles as intricate plot mechanisms. But I liked this just the same. Like slipping on your favorite old pair of slippers. Or something like that. I actually don’t wear slippers. I’m pretty tired right now. From the unsleeping child I have sired. Murder on the Orient Express clocks in at a brisk 265 paperback pages. It reads even faster because much of the novel is dialogue. I appreciated the dry wit, the bemused, laidback cunning that is Poirot’s modus operandi. The plot, which I will not spoil – or even delineate – frequently pushes the boundaries of normal human reality. There were times when I thought it was going to veer over the cliffs of stupidity. At the end, Christie manages to pull things back. The conclusion, I will admit, was humorously clever. She was a pro, I'll give her that. I refuse to engage in low punning, and say this was a fine time killer. But it actually was, so I guess in this instance I will deploy that pun. I needed something to read that required no heavy lifting, and Christie delivered. This sounds like damning with faint praise, which is not my intent. It’s no small feat to deliver consistent, reliably competent entertainment. Based on Christie’s sales numbers, she has certainly done that. I’m in no great hurry to pick up another of her Poirot mysteries, but it’s nice to know that there is a whole bunch of them out there. "

Any of you who know Agatha Christie will know the approximate concept of this novel; a detective investigates a suspicious murder on a stopped train. Yet this one is quite good; between the a fast-paced plot, dynamic cast of characters, and humorous moments, it's a great read. Yet what truly stands out here is the reveals. Shocking me with a revelation despite it being a literal detective novel is brilliant. I suspected every character from the beginning, yet I still ended #shook at all the little reveals. The details of the story are so odd, and the ending solution so satisfying, that I almost want to give the book a reread. Perhaps my one complaint would be the character confusion; it was sometimes hard to keep track of all twelve suspects. This is where I'd like to give a huge thank you to Dan Stevens' audio narration. His voice alone could kill me in an alleyway and I'd be grateful. If you're going to read this, please try the audiobook.// SOMEWHAT SPOILERY PLOT SECTION //This is a novel of twelve main suspects. Yes, you heard that right; twelve. There's Mary Debenham, an English girl and former governess, described as cold and gray-eyed. The English Colonel, aloof and mysterious and possibly connected to her. The Italian, suspected by Bouc because of racism. Monsieur Hartman, a mysterious detective. The young English McQueen, sharing his room with Poirot. His older companion Ratchet, full of malevolence. Princess Dragomiroff, the ugly and oddly-named Russian woman. The Hungarian prince and princess, a handsome thirty year old traveling with a twenty-year-old foreign woman with pale skin. Mrs. Hubbard, an older American woman and a fantastic busybody. A sheep-faced Swedish woman. Monsieur Harris, presumably late. And of course, Monsieur Bouc, an old friend of Poirot's, and our detective himself. At 23 minutes to one, Poirot hears Ratchet moving around. A ting occurs at quarter past one, leading to a Mrs. Hubbard and conductor confrontation. Something heavy hits the door later, and a woman is walking down the hall near the conductor.

147,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7022024-mike,Rating 4 out of 5,"It is quite apparent why Murder on the Orient Express stands out as a classic from Christie's other works: it is the epitome of Hercule Poirot's style of detective work. In this book we see Poirot style (leaning back and thinking) distilled to its essence. Christie at her best gives the reader all the clues to solve the mystery but weaves them in such a deft and subtle way that you don't realize you've been exposed to a clue until Poirot wraps it all up in a neat little package. I was able to pick up a few things but, as happens to all mysteries I read, had no clue what the truth was until the end. The reveal at the end showcases the skill Christie has in constructing elaborate, but perfectly logical, crimesThe setting of this mystery is minimal, simply a cabin on a snowed in train. But this bare, snow white backdrop is punctuated by a host of colorful characters: an English officer, a Russian aristocrat, an Austrian diplomat, and an American salesman to name a few. The murder itself leaves some clues (though which are true clues and which are red herrings may drive you batty) but the driving force of this mystery is the diverse (well, in class and social station at least, everybody is as white as the snow outside) passengers.The journey to this conclusion is quite enjoyable as Christie is able to fully sketch out the characters on the train in rather brief scenes. She is a very effective and economical writer, I felt like I had a great understanding of these characters after only a few pages with them. And they are quite the cast of characters ranging across class and nations (and all, oddly, with these understated racists views of the other guests: Americans are all too loud, British people are too proper to ever show emotion, Italians LIKE TO STAB PEOPLE WITH KNIVES. Seriously, that was an entire thread where one character thought the Italian did it because the victim was found stabbed to death and Italians just love to stab people dontchaknow). Christie delivers on both the journey and the destination of this mystery.I can very much see why this book was turned into a movie (and soon, another movie), though I am a bit concerned that the new movie might try to sexy the story up by adding action scenes or other tension inducing scenes that just aren't in this book. The story is rather low key in that regard, with Poirot's investigation being carried out in a very orderly, and methodical manner. there really aren't any instances of danger or violence or anything that exciting. The appeal of the story is the complex nature of the crime and what Poirot must do to unravel it. I don't know how well that translates onto the big screen having never seen the classic original adaptation but I could see it going a bit off the rails (pun slightly intended) for the new adaptation). Time will tell.Movies aside, this is a great mystery and well deserving of its place at the top of the genre's pantheon of classics."

**4.2 stars**“And now a passenger lies dead in his berth - stabbed. ”
I read this one back in the 9th standard. We all were crazy back then about Christie, and this one was in the news for being made into a movie. And one day, one of my friends surprised me by presenting a copy of this book on my birthday.I enjoyed this book. I mean, come on, I was bound to. Even on my recent reread, I still enjoyed that sort of nostalgic cosiness that I used to, as a kid, while reading whodunnits. And this one is quite rightfully told to be one of Christie’s best works. The ending, if you don’t know it, you will practically never see it coming. (if you do, most probably you’re a genius)Also, there’s nothing whatsoever to comment on the almost flawless plot. Personally, I would have preferred a bit more character development for a few of the characters, but probably it’s better without it. No sign of bragging anywhere, obviously. People usually complain the story starts a bit blandly, but I disagree. However, there’s something that I often felt I needed to complain about in almost all of her stories. It’s as if the characters are aware from the beginning of some sinister happening, as well as the weather. Partly the weather is the reason for which I feel the story to be cosy enough to read while lying in the bed wrapped in my favourite blanket, but still, I think of it as a flaw.Moreover, the dialogues of Christie are always a bit, Lovecraftian. They feel bookish, not realistic for some reason. Take one, for instance:
“See you, my dear doctor, me, I am not one to rely upon exact procedure. It is the psychology I seek, not the fingerprint or the cigarette ash… This compartment is full of clues, but can I be sure that those clues are really what they seem to be?”
 See? What I’m trying to say? Apart from that it’s a perfect story for a wintry night or even a rainy night. Also for now, when you’re locked at home. You can relate a bit to the recklessness to get out.“The murderer is with us - on the train now…”Christie #3"

After so many movie versions (usually making Poirot something of a joke) it’s hard to clear the mind of previous knowledge of how Christie deals with the actual murder.One of the most striking things for me is the wonderful setting on the Orient Express, something Christie was very familiar with. The upscale clientele, train employees, and servants of the monied passengers are a window into a time long gone."

(P.253)I had seen the old film version of this story with Albert Finney  spoiler which I can recommend for a lazy afternoon's entertainment, glasses of sherry and plates of cakes are entirely optional but may well enhance the viewing experience  a few months earlier which made it easier to pay attention to how the novel is constructed. Ah-ha, I said, the misleading time of death, I've seen that before in The murder of Roger Ackroyd, people pretending to be some that they are not, yeah seen that before. It was precisely this quality, and they they were relatively abundantly available that made the novels of Agatha Christie so interesting to the semiotics group centred around Yurii Lotman at Tartu university  I've mentioned this before in a review, but not recently, so I won't apologise for repeating myself. Christie novels consist of a fixed number of elements that can be broken apart and reassembled in any order, you're not going to be ever surprised, which makes them very comfortable books to read, or indeed to make comfortable television or cinema. In this one we are told that the murderer is onboard the train, but one can not truly gasp with shock or fear, the murderer will not wrestle with Poirot in the open doorway of a moving train, nor will the murderer even spit in the soup before running away to freedom. Upper class life will continue as it always has, indeed the crime itself may be an attempt to maintain continuity. Christie is writing the opposite of poverty porn; she gave us little bundles of privilege porn, the occasional murder and its resolution is a little entertainment, a distraction perhaps from actual crimes.Like the aforementioned Roger Ackroyd, this one also comes with a floor plan of a train carriage, but it seems that Cludo never produced a train carriage version of the game. The carriage itself is effectively a country house, it doesn't even move for most of the novel.The ending is particularly ridiculous, or ingenious; and borrows I felt from G.K.Chesterton's Father Brown who as a Priest considered that his spiritual judgement was superior to that of any temporal legal system  climb on board the Chesterton Express to Theocracy, this train is ready to depart! , in this case, possibly more prosaically the business interests of the Orient Express company triumph. Though that part, you might feel, is only realistic part of the entire fable. "

Overall, I did enjoy this book which is the tenth in the Hercule Poirot series, but I am left with some conflicted feelings.The Orient Express train is traveling along full of passengers when it is forced to stop when a snowdrift blocks its' path. Millionaire Samuel Edward Ratchett is found stabbed to death in his compartment the next morning. Thank goodness detective Hercule Poirot is a passenger on the train and will get to the bottom of things.I believe this is the fifth Agatha Christie novel I have read and it's not difficult to see why her novels continue to be popular decades after they were first published. I have yet to be able to correctly predict what happened before reaching the ending. I thought this one was fairly clever but I still have some mixed feelings about it. I keep asking myself if this were a contemporary mystery novel would I be impressed with the story or find it's conclusion to be a little too outrageous. Without a doubt Agatha Christie deserves credit for being ahead of her time in the genre, but yeah I am struggling with would I think this book is as good if someone else wrote it and if it took place in a modern setting. Regardless of my conflicted feelings, I still enjoyed it as Agatha knows how to craft a tale that makes you want to keep reading to find out the ending."
155,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44212467-fred-shaw,Rating 5 out of 5,"""Murder On The Orient Express"" is a masterful story. What an amusing series of events, characters and setting, and of course the amazing French detective par excellence, M. Hercules Poirot, will not be outdone. Agatha Christie is rightfully so, the most published author of all time. Patterson, Steele and other mass producers of fiction, eat your heart out. There were times when Poirot was so irritating, so logical, meticulous, brilliant, that in the end, you could only be astonished and love the guy. His friend, M. Bouc and the good Dr. Constantine, both intelligent men, jump to conclusions, but the Frenchman is never fooled. If you have not read it treat yourself. The solving of the crime, the revealing presentation, and the denouement is by far the best I have ever read."
156,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22699228-matt-quann,Rating 2 out of 5,"Originally published in 1934, Murder on the Orient Express is a novel that hasn't aged extremely well. Christie's famous detective, the intrepid Hercule Poirot, takes off on what is, apparently, his tenth chronicled adventure. As far as continuity, there's the suggestion that M. Poirot has just solved a case, but readers new to the detective will be just as at home as those well versed in his adventures. In brief: a millionaire is stabbed twelve times in a train that leaves Istanbul and is stranded in a snow storm with no one but Hercule Poirot to solve the mystery.Poirot investigates each of the 12 suspects in what amounts to repetitive interview scenes with subtle variation. It's all about the evidence here, and it is expected that you are not only following the small clues being laid out before you, but also that you are taking notes and positing your own theories as to who might be involved in the murder. I can see how some readers might find this appealing, but it made this brief novel such a slog for me. I have a hard time bringing myself to care about who's pipe was left in the carriage and at what time they ate dinner. This is my first novel by the author this book cover calls: ""The Queen of Mystery."" Admittedly, I didn't think this book was terrible and I can understand the appeal of this type of mystery. However, it progresses in a way that betrays the time in which it was written. I read through in a flurry today so that I could get started on an impressive stack of Christmas books. This might be entirely unfounded babble, but I found the novel to provide few surprises and to be laid out in an almost prescribed manner. The novel lays out a case, gathers evidence, and then provides you with a stereotypical parlour scene where the detective lays out the answers along with the logic which led him to his conclusion. I wonder if this type of storytelling reflects a desire for simpler storytelling from a simpler time. You'll find only surface motivation for characters' actions throughout the novel. Though Christie does a fine job describing the characters' physical reactions, she doesn't ever delve into their psyche and she allows a line to be drawn between cause and effect. This is in contrast with modern mysteries and thrillers whose plots examine broken psyches, chaotic and indiscernible motives of killers, or move deeply through investigation of a character's motivations. I wonder if it is that the world felt more comfortable when it could be laid out as neat and tidy as done here by Christie. I would also posit that some of today's thrillers would seem extremely experimental if sent back into the 1930s. So, what Christie does here, she does well. Poirot is a suitably mentally overpowered detective whose skills of deduction leave his assistants baffled by his leaps in logic. There were a few instances in which I thought Christie had done something cute or smart by convincing a character to reveal their hand through subtle conversation. Also, the reveal at the end is surprising and made me feel both as if I should have seen it coming and I never could have seen it coming. It all sticks together pretty well, and I could never fault Christie for having made a foolish jump in logic or misleading the reader. This morning I read an Arthur Conan Doyle story that pulled off the brilliant detective mystery with much more charm and warmth. Perhaps it is more that I prefer Holmes reliance on evidence than Poirot's inference from conversation. I won't say that I'm abandoning Christie, but I won't be rushing to pick up another of her novels anytime soon. You know, maybe it's just that mysteries are not thrillers, and mysteries just aren't my thing."

Prepare yourself for a thrilling journey filled with unexpected twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat!In this gripping tale, we are introduced to Hercule Poirot, a brilliant detective known for his distinctive mustache. As he investigates a perplexing murder aboard the luxurious Orient Express train, we are immersed in a suspenseful plot that keeps us guessing until the very end. Christie's attention to detail and storytelling skills are evident throughout, making it difficult to put the book down as we eagerly try to unravel the truth!The cast of characters is diverse and intriguing, each with their own secrets and motives that add depth to the mystery. We find ourselves constantly questioning and speculating about the identity of the culprit. Christie's writing keeps us engaged, always on our toes, unsure of whom to trust.However, one aspect that may be challenging for some readers is the presence of French words throughout the book. While these words contribute to the authenticity of the setting and characters, they can be somewhat confusing, particularly for those not familiar with the language. This may interrupt the reading flow. It can be a minor drawback for readers seeking a smoother reading experience.Furthermore, for me, the revelation at the end of the story may also prove somewhat confusing. Christie introduces unexpected twists and turns that may leave readers puzzled. While this adds to the overall intrigue, it can make the resolution of the mystery feel convoluted and hard to follow.Despite these minor setbacks, Christie's ability to build tension and deliver surprises is commendable. The vivid descriptions of the Orient Express transport us into its luxurious world, immersing us in the ambiance and heightening the suspense.For fans of suspenseful mysteries and Christie's work, 'Murder on the Orient Express' is worth exploring. However, it is important to note that the inclusion of French words and the somewhat confusing revelation at the end may impact the reading experience. Considering these aspects, I rate the book 4 stars."

Christie, even upon re-read, managed to lead me around by the nose. This time, there was no Hastings to share my confusion. Instead, Poirot's friend, M. Bouc, fills the role of bamboozled sounding board. Poirot treats him much the same, giving him all the facts and encouraging him to think. Sadly, real thought is not something that many people practice regularly. There are people in my circle who mistake feeling emotion or ruminating for reasoning, so I have sympathy for M. Poirot.This is an ingenious mystery! Not a solution that a reader would readily anticipate, but one that makes perfect sense when laid out in the end by Poirot. I love the way that Christie does the unexpected. This is another of those instances where she is lenient with the criminal. I'm amazed at how often she is sympathetic to the law breaker.Original ReviewI am surprised by how easily and quickly Dame Agatha’s books slip by. I can certainly see why this is one of her favoured books, loved by many. It does reveal Hercule Poirot at his best, exercising those little gray cells. Now my reading of Anne Holt’s 1222 last year makes more sense—is it ever an homage to Christie and the Orient Express!I can also see where it is nearly impossible for the reader to guess the ending of this one, so Christie – 2, Wanda – 0 so far with my Agatha Christie reading."

This is the second Christie mystery I've read; first one being And Then There Were None which is certainly more thrilling than this one.It has good characterization and very good intricate plot as well which held my interest throughout. I liked how the characters are of different nationalities and their opinion of each other. Christie has very good sense of humor as well. A thoroughly enjoyable read; however, the ending was slightly underwhelming. I mean, Poirot presents two solutions, what next?

The thing about her mysteries is that they never really end the way you expect them to. This book – as per Christie usual – is genius. What most disturbed me about this book is that it is based on a true case, which makes me shudder to think about it. Agatha Christie often uses and knows how to write an isolated setting very well. I loved how she used the train in this case, and what it meant for the mystery. She did a good job of incorporating the setting into the situation. Was it just me, or did Poirot have a bit more sass than usual in this one? He often has quite a big ego, but he is usually a little bit more underhand and discreet about his comments. However, in this one I felt like he was a bit more theatrical and obvious in his dislike or like of some people. The characters were all very interesting. There was quite a range of cast as usual, so you don’t get too close to any character in particular. Her mysteries are mostly plot driven books. But we do get a little taste for each of them and what their motives may have been, which are all believable. The one thing I didn’t like about this novel was its structure. I’d only read three Agatha Christie novels by the time I read this one, but this was the first one where the evidence was given and organised in this way. Because of it, it felt more like reading a factual document where the storytelling was tacked on at the end. I understand why she chose to format this mystery like it, but it meant I wasn’t as engaged with the story as I potentially could’ve been…But then the outcome of the mystery came. I won’t tell you how things went down, but I felt like what Poirot did this time round was incredibly intriguing. It opens up room for discussion about morals and ethics, and what you would have done in the same situation. Needless to say, I will be reading more Agatha Christie."

Io avevo cominciato ad intuire qualcosa solo a pochissime pagine dalla fine, ma il tutto è stato studiato alla perfezione.

Will Poirot be able to find the killer before the train is dug out and reaches the station?I finished this in the first week of January... AND IT ALREADY MAKES IT PLACE ON MY FAVORITES OF THE YEAR SHELF! Last year, it took till late February/early March for the first book to take its spot there. Needless to say, I loved this book. It was my first outing with both Christie and Poirot, and I am definitely not disappointed.In the past, mysteries have been known to confuse me. I'd follow the detective[s] up to the part where the killer is revealed.... and I'd get lost. Then the explanation would come and I would lose my head because I would be so confused. A bunch of little details would be recalled, but they would have been foreshadowed a lot, just mentioned in passing, or totally be taken out of the blue, and I'd just be left confused. The great thing about this book, is that you're able to follow Hercule's thoughts, what he notices, and you are able to figure out the mystery yourself. I am glad to say, this is the first mystery that I DID figure out, before the detective did :D. What I loved about this book was that there are so many facets to the typical ""whodunit"" that even though I did figure out ""whodunit"", I was still surprised by the ethical discourse by the end, the why, the backstories of the suspects, everything was excellent.The atmosphere was another part of this mystery that I greatly appreciated. Even though Christie was building up this great mystery, she was able to create an enthralling aura of the train itself. Reading about it, though it is not very present, added that sprinkle of ""that little something"" to the entire setting. Although I did love this book, there were some moments that I found confusing/boring: the beginning was kind of weird. There were three chapters before we got on the train, which I guess were important in the grand scheme of things, but they greatly discouraged me early on. Other than that, I also found some chapters in the last segment (not the final chapter, it was perfect) to be stretched out and I was a bit bored (this, however, may be because at this point I figured out the mystery and it was obvious to me).Overall, this was a fantastic book. Despite my initial apprehension to starting it due to the fact it is Hercule's 10th book, I found it perfectly readable and fascinating. Everything from the mystery itself, to the morals discussed, to the atmosphere was amazing. I highly recommend this book."

This is for a good reason, as from a plot standpoint this is easily one of the most compelling. Also, due to it’s setting, it is also one of the most cinematic stories as can be shown by the multiple adaptations of the novel. As you can see above I gave it the full five stars, yet I find this the most difficult novel in the series to discuss for much the same reason I had issues discussing “The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.” This is a brilliantly plotted novel, lots of fun, but the solution is genius enough that it elevates it to the five star status. The ending of this one has indeed become so famous that I no longer even considered it a spoiler for quite some time (having seen the conclusion referenced in multiple TV shows and even flat out said in a few of them) but then with the release of the newest film adaptation last year, I discovered that yes, there are indeed people who will be furious upon hearing the ending, so my discussion of the book is limited to say the least. So, what can I say about this one that hasn’t already been said? Overall, not much. For those who have not been initiated into the world of Hercule Poirot, I would recommend this as an excellent starting point. As most of the novels in the series are stand alone, there is nothing in this one that would ruin any of the past novels, and indeed it is so well plotted that from my own experience I can say that it makes one want to jump to another Christie novel immediately afterwards.Eh... you know what, there's nothing more I can really add. If you haven't read it, I highly suggest you do. A wholehearted recommendation to anyone who reads. "

To that end, I wrote on five works in which the action is confined to a small space, but in which the reader somehow experiences the world. Here is #1:A train that is unusually full for the season on its way from Istanbul to London becomes trapped in a snowdrift in a remote region of Croatia. On the following morning a malevolent American is found dead behind the locked door of his first class compartment having been stabbed twelve times. This, of course, is the opening gambit of Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express. With no means of moving or reaching the outside world, detective Hercule Poirot, his fellow passengers, and we—as readers—find ourselves trapped for the remainder of the novel in the close quarters of three compartments of the train under a cloud of suspicion.Uninitiated readers might assume that this is a perfect set up for fidgety feelings of claustrophobia. But the aficionado knows that while murder is generally the culmination of a series of events in life, it is the beginning of events in Agatha Christie. As Poirot observes to a friend while sitting in the dining car: “Around us are people of all classes, of all nationalities, of all ages;” or, in other words, a microcosm of the world. And however preposterous the mystery’s solution, the pursuit of motives among this international assembly of suspects initiates for us a journey into the diverging branches of the past and a close examination of the complexities of human psychology."

I bet in the almost 85 year since Murder on the orient express was published that only a few have accurately predicted the outcome! there is a universal appeal to a murder mystery. demonstrated by Agatha Christie being the best sold author of all time. but she is not only a great mystery author but one of the best author of all time. some authors are great in there own genre and other are great among greats, and Agatha is a pillar of literature. after reading a bad or disappointing book i often turn to the stand bye authors or series that rarely disappoints for solace. Christie and Poirot are just that. entertaining and thought provoking in a safe sort of manner in which you know what to expect but not the outcome. a good pallet cleanser if you will. i personally can't find a flaw with Orient Express, but the only i can conceive is that some maybe put off by the character Hercule Poirot himself. he is a bit of a arrogant European archetype. but to me he has Infinite old world charm. i know this is not really a review of this book but it's hard to review without spoilers and most know at least the pop culture references. so to those who aren't familiar with Murder on the orient express i urge them to read it and tell me what you think even if it is to curse me out. it's a instant favorite for me."

Agatha Christie's writing style is sharp and this ""whodunnit"" book is amazing. On the legendary Orient Express, Detective Hercule Poirot finds himself trapped by a snowstorm that halts the train's journey. As dawn breaks, a shocking discovery is made - a passenger has been brutally murdered inside a locked compartment. With no escape from the snowy surroundings, he realised that the killer was still among them, and it was his task to unveil their identity.I absolutely loved this locked-room murder mystery. Something is thrilling about suspects trapped in one place, making it clear that the culprit is among them. What makes it even more captivating is the intricate web of deception, with red herrings and intriguing characters who all seem to be hiding something. And when the solution is finally unveiled, I'm always amazed by the sheer cleverness of it all, realizing that the clues were right there in front of me the whole time. One minor issue I have is that Poirot conducts individual interviews with each person, and these interviews are described in great detail. It became monotonous and repetitive to listen to each person recount the same event with only slight variations. However, all of this concludes, it returns to the thrilling aspects of the story.

Since the denouement has become so ingrained in our cultural unconscious (it feels like everyone knows the end, even those who haven't read the book or seen the many TV adaptations), that we have the tendency to undervalue this little gem.

Sin embargo creo que no es una de las mejores novela de la autora. Me he encontrado otras que me han cautivado más que esta.Si es cierto que la premisa de la historia es buena e incluso como el mismo Poirot dice no es el tipico caso en el que se encuentra normalmente.-El interés que tiene este caso para mí-reside en que se aparta de todos los procedimientos normales. ¿Han dicho la verdad o han mentido las personas que hemos interrogado? No tenemos medio de averiguarlo....excepto los que podamos discenir nosotros mismos. Es un gran ejercicio cerebral que tenemos que realizar..El argumento sigue el mismo que el resto de las otras novelas de la autora por lo que no voy a explayarme demasiado.

There's a decision that's made about justice at the end of the book that I don't agree with. I will say that, while I do understand the decision made at the end, I do not agree with the decision.

I feel like I've earned a membership in a secret elite book club or something. But it's not really only after a self fulfilling purpose that I am now putting this book on its rightful pedestal because this is certainly a very clever, witty, twisty, unexpected, and enjoyable detective story and Ms. Christie truly deserved to earn that Queen of Mystery title. The mystery was like solving an intricate puzzle not very different from those old mind games I used to play when I was younger. Like that hangman mystery. A man committed suicide and there is a pool of water underneath him...and so on, just please Google it.

189,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,Rating 5 out of 5,"You have this impression of Agatha Christie as a kindly old lady who writes generic mysteries featuring tea and knitting. And she was that, but before she was that she was this ladywho is significantly younger and looks like a little bit of a badass, and in fact she was one.The central question of a mystery is ""Who done it,"" right? And what Christie did is she took that question and said, ""How far can I take the answer? How weird can I make it?"" And she comes up with these wild, experimental, metafictional reveals. I don't want to spoil this particular book, but I didn't see it coming. It's actually crazy stuff, and this is why she's the queen of mystery: she took mysteries to their absolute limits. No one has been able to take them farther.I mean, look, she's not Borges, she's not going to blow your mind on contact. Hers is a quieter magic, and it's constrained by genre. She's straining the limits of mystery novels; Borges is straining the limits of reality. But it's still audacious.Christie created two (!) of the greatest sleuths in the genre: knitting busybody Miss Marples, and the hero of Murder on the Orient Express, smug Hercule Poirot. He bills himself as a sort of opposite to Sherlock Holmes: ""I am not one to rely on the expert procedure. It is the psychology I seek, not the fingerprint or the cigarette ash."" If Holmes represents science, Poirot represents intuition. This case takes place in a closed room - the train is stuck in a snowstorm, with no communication with the outside world. No one's identity can be verified. Poirot resolves to solve it entirely through sitting around thinking. And when he does: ""How did you get wise to all this? That's what I want to know.""""I just guessed.""The evidence was there for us - Agatha Christie never cheats, her puzzles are airtight - but it's a pretty impressive guess anyway. And it's an impressive book.Here's a diagram of the train car, in case you're interested."

Poirot is returning from solving another case and was hoping for a short holiday, but receives a message asking him to return to London immediately. At first he is assured that it will be easy to book a berth on the Orient Express, but, it seems that more people than usual are travelling. Thankfully, a solution is found and, before long, Poirot is assessing his fellow passengers. One is a man, named Ratchett, who asks Poirot for protection – but the detective does not take the case, insulted by increasing offers of money.However, Ratchett is correct in saying he does need protection, as he is stabbed to death in his cabin. The train is stuck in a snowdrift, but the number of wounds on the body confuse both the doctor and Poirot. Most of us will probably know what happened to Ratchett, and why – and even by whom - but it makes no difference. The joy is in the telling and Christie unravels the mystery with consummate ease. Christie’s novels, although about murder, are the ultimate comfort read; full of sly humour, such as Ratchett’s secretary confusing Poirot’s name with a woman’s dressmaker! She takes her characters, and her readers, on a perfectly plotted journey. There is a wonderful cast of characters, an exotic location and a great story. If you have never read this before, I envy you. It is one of Poirot’s greatest cases – read and enjoy."

Like many, I've heard of the story and have seen some adaptations, but it was to finally get to the source material.We meet Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, a famous genius when it comes to solving crimes / puzzles. He's travelling on a train where a passenger is suddenly murdered. A bit of a locked-room-mystery.What follows is a very entertaining bout of sleuthing that has us and the protagonist do some character studies as well as a chase for clues.I had heard that Poirot was eccentric but I had no problem with him and his way of dealing with the crisis at hand. Moreover, I loved his methodical and almost clinically logical approach. Oh, and I've always been a sucker for trying to pick up the right details to be able to put them all together and solve the riddle so this was right up my alley.Moreover, the characters Christie created for this murder were wonderfully vavacious so there was never a moment of boredom. I can definitely see why this has become the most famous of her stories. Not to mention that bloodthirsty little me got what she came for. Total satisfaction :)"

It was, however, difficult to remember the layout of the compartments on the train and who occupied which compartments. From the moment of murder until Hercule Poirot gathered the audience and laid before them, the series of events occurred and related to the murder; I thoroughly enjoyed it. The revelation was baffling, and I did not see it coming. ""It is perhaps a fault with us detectives. We expect the behavior to be always consistent. We do not allow for changes of mood."" "

Kind of like even if you've never read Hamlet you know that there's a prince who can't make a decision, a reason to make Oedipal jokes, and a pile of bodies at the end, you know?Reason for finally picking up: I found it during a bookshelf rearrangement and I was going on an eight-hour train ride the next day! It was clearly fate!Verdict: Not perfect, but ultimately no regrets! An excellent afternoon's entertainment.I read a lot of classics, for sure. But they tend to be Classics with a Very Definite Capital C. I've only realized just recently that I have sort of failed at reading more modern genre classics. Like, for someone who reads as much high fantasy as I do, it took me a decade to read the entirety of LOTR and even longer to read The Last Unicorn and The Time Machine. I still haven't read LeGuin which has to consign me to sci-fi hell forever. I don't know why this is the case- I read a ton of old and dated fiction books and only catch up on the new ones later (oh hey, purpose of this blog!), but my genre reading is usually recent stuff. I just got into mysteries for the first time as an adult though (thank you, Tana French and Kate Atkinson!), so I don't make that same weird oversight this time. I'm re-listening to old Holmes stories on audio (I deeply recommend the BBC radio drama versions!) and recently read a Dorothy Sayers for a start.Murder on the Orient Express seemed like a great place to continue the trend. For those who have hidden under the hole I have been in for years, Murder takes place in the 1930s on a train heading from Istanbul to Calais. It begins as an innocent journey home for our erstwhile hero Hercule Poirot, at this point in his series a famous gentleman detective whose name is known across Europe. But of course we know it won't stay that way- as their train becomes snowbound in the mountains of the Balkans, a man is murdered. A man who had told Poirot not a day beforehand that he feared for his life, and a man who could only have been murdered by someone on the train. (DUN DUN DUN and dramatic, rapid close up heavily implied by every use of italics, by the way!) Poirot is asked to investigate, and the drama really begins!Of course it all seems very campy in 2016. The chapters are written for gasp and awe, for clues turning up and sentences worded just so for our lead to pounce on and make much of while lesser minds sit in stupefaction. There are vampy ladies and spider-in-a-web ladies, colorful characters with fake accents and fake passports, still-waters-run-deep dark horses and seemingly-guilty red herring characters who could never have done it. I expected this- but what I did not expect is that Christie was in on the joke! She was recognizing all these tropes and calling herself out on it, even before some of these things were fully tropes yet! She has Poirot going around meta-commenting on what would happen ""if this were a crime novel"" (and then sometimes it does!). Her chapter and section titles themselves strip down the pretense of magic and story and show the workmanlike nature of many mystery stories (""Part I: The Facts"", ""Part II: The Evidence"", ""Part III: Hercule Poirot Sits Back and Thinks""). And of course the solution, which I won't reveal for the few people who don't know it, is another expression of the prevalence of the mystery narrative in popular culture at the time, and how people create and participate in stories based on the models given to them. But there's never a sense that Christie is sneering at the genre, which is always the danger of this sort of thing. She gives us the atmosphere and characters we want so basically that they're almost archetypes and very much enjoys doing it, no matter how deep her insight into the genre is.(It reminded me very much of the attitude the Tonys have had on Broadway the last few years, actually, as they celebrate the year in live theatre- they've deconstructed and commented on and made fun of the medium (and especially the musical) from every possible angle, and offered highly self-aware enjoyment of a highly visibly fake product and you know what- people still come back for the sequins and high-kicks and the same Phantom ballads anyway. And, at bottom, even these high sophisticates twisting cleverly and ironically around the form love it too. No matter what people do, there's too much love to kill the genre. You're not going to make people have whatever better taste you think they should have, so you might as well enjoy those sequins. YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO.)I also liked Poirot. There is a danger that some readers may find him fussy or pretentious, but I liked him because of those flaws. Too many authors these days are afraid to make their protagonist ridiculous in any way (especially in genre stories). Their flaws tend to be tragic or comic in an obvious slap-stick way that makes you feel bad for them (oh the endless heroines with an inability to see objects on the ground the may trip over!). Poirot is a little bit irritating and pompous in a not at all admirable-or-sympathetic way, I can tell I'd need a break from being in a room with him after a bit, and I thought that was great. So many smart people I know are like that. The atmosphere is also pretty great. The way that it is set up is that a succession of people come to see Poirot to give their stories about where they were when the guy is murdered. This helps to create a sense of ongoing palpable tension as the reader imagines all these people waiting their turn and talking about it after they've gone in with each other- the possible murderer always sitting in their midst. And of course, the snowbound train creates a sense of these people living in a separate world, where normal laws cannot apply, and things that would seem surreal anywhere else suddenly seem perfectly reasonable.Flaws of the book. Well, the biggest one is the super active and noticeable racism on the part of many of the characters- which I suppose is unsurprising in a book with an international cast written in the 1930s. It's super in your face, though. You can't ignore it even if you want to. People are seriously trying to solve the case by saying, ""Well, Italians are all passionate and would all make knife strokes like this, so its definitely him!"". Granted, a lot of Poirot's dialogue and the ultimate solution acts as a rebuke to this so I don't think its mostly Christie's position. But not all of it, I don't think. I mean, that's what happens with dated books, but FYI, y'all. Also, some of Poirot's method relies on ""psychology,"" which differentiates him from Holmes, for sure- some of it is valid, some of it feels like magic deus ex machina insights, and some is just a little bit racist. Towards the end especially his intuitive leaps start to get a bit much, like not even Christie could figure out how he knew that one. Unsatisfying.But I read this in one afternoon- it perfectly filled an eight-hour train ride, spaced out between naps and scenery watching. A great afternoon's entertainment that I can't imagine, overall, that you'd regret. Which I imagine is exactly what Christie intended it to be."

“The impossible could not have happened, therefore the impossible must be possible in spite of appearances.” 

I have never read an Agatha Christie book in my life, I, of course, know who she is but for me, classic novels are not really for me, even my favorite English teacher in school couldn't get me into anything classic and well loved by many. Honestly, I'm more likely to pick up something new or something I've wanted to read for awhile, rather than a classic. So why did I pick this up? The movie of course! I'm OCD about reading a book before the movie comes out.But saying this, I, for the most part, enjoyed this novel. Will I read more? Well, lets just say I won't go out searching for them like I would other books, but I would definitely give another one a go.The premise is pretty straightforward here.Hercule Poirot, master detective is aboard the Orient Express when one of the passengers is savagely murdered. The door was locked from the inside and there are no signs of forced entry or a way to get out without being seen. With the train being hit by a crazy snowstorm, Hercule Poirot must work out who among them is the murderer, what their motive was, and how they managed to move about without being seen.Although this novel is part of a series, it can be read as a stand-alone.For the most part, I enjoyed the mystery side of the story. It left you guessing, and trying to figure out who was lying and who was telling the truth. Hercule had a pretty interesting way of putting the pieces together and coming to a conclusion. But because I don't want to give too much away, I won't be going into too many details about anything other than the premise. One thing I will say is I kinda guessed what was going to happen/who the killer was. I literally sat there about 3/4 of the way through like, ""no! no... it couldn't be.. but if I'm right, conspiracy!' “But I know human nature, my friend, and I tell you that, suddenly confronted with the possibility of being tried for murder, the most innocent person will lose his head and do the most absurd things.”“The body—the cage—is everything of the most respectable—but through the bars, the wild animal looks out.""What I struggled with, which to me was no surprise was the writing. It's not a writing style I enjoyed. It also had some old term which i wasn't quite used too and were very old fashioned. And the french parts? I DONT SPEAK FRENCH. So I felt like I was missing something while reading, although its possible I didn't miss anything interesting; nevertheless, it really annoyed me. Also, there was no real suspense. I know right, no suspense in a murder mystery..whaaaat? In all, I liked this book but I wouldn't say I loved it. It had a few issues which were more based on my own personal preference/ the time period it was written, and the fact that I kinda picked what was going on. Other than that, this was a unique murder mystery, especially for the time it was written, which is why I get why it's so well loved and Agatha Christie made a name for herself. Recommended for: Classic, Murder Mystery, Fiction."

It was OK. I had to keep telling myself that some of the conventions and tropes she used, she probably INVENTED, so there is that. I also enjoyed how she subverted the whole form of the locked-room mystery form. She blew it to hell (about as much as I can say without giving the ending away to whoever on this planet doesn't know how it ends). But the prose was mediocre and the characters floated between bland/conventional and cut-outs. Again, it wasn't bad, just not a genre I spend a lot of time with. If I'm reading detective novels, it is a different type entirely.* The movie was also good without being exceptional."

209,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17017216-b-rbara,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 estrellasQué extraño que no haya profesado aquí mi amor a este libro de la tía Agatha. Es una de sus más grandes obras, y además contiene muchos elementos que, entrelazados, nos entregan una excelente historia de misterio: una tormenta de nieve, un tren varado en medio de la nada, un asesinato imposible, sospechosos por donde mires. Creo que Asesinato en el Orient Express puede competir fácilmente con otras obras de Agatha, como El asesinato de Roger Ackroyd o Diez Negritos: mantiene al lector con los ojos fijos en sus páginas intentando adivinar (sin éxito en la mayoría de los casos) la resolución del asesinato.Pero ojo, que nada se le escapa a Hercule PoirotDejo por aquí algunas curiosidades que recopilé con motivo del estreno de la última adaptación cinematográfica:1. En 1972, Agatha elaboró una lista de sus 10 libros favoritos. Uno de ellos es Murder on the Orient Express.2. En EE.UU. se publicó como Murder in the Calais Couch debido a que una novela de G. Greene había sido publicada como Orient Express.3. Se publicó como una serie de 6 partes en el Saturday Evening Post en 1933, antes de hacerlo como novela en 1934.4. Agatha Christie dedicó Murder on the Orient Express a su segundo esposo, el arqueólogo Max Mallowan.5. Murder in Mesopotamia se publicó después que Murder on the Orient Express. Sin embargo, el caso de Mesopotamia es anterior al del Orient Express, como bien señala la narradora de aquel.6. Los medios de locomoción son escenarios recurrentes en las novelas de Agatha Christie. Además de trenes (Murder on the Orient Express, Mystery of the Blue Train, 4:50 from Paddington) se suman los barcos (Death on the Nile) y los aviones (Death in the clouds).7. Murder on the Orient Express es una de las novelas que no se mencionan ni de pasada en los cuadernos de Agatha Christie, por lo que desconocemos su planificación.8. Murder on the Orient Express, At’s Bertram Hotel y, en menor medida, The Hollow se construyen sobre los mismos cimientos, según John Curran.9. Agatha siempre soñó con viajar en el Orient Express, hasta que lo logró en 1928. De hecho, lo describió como “el tren de mis sueños”.10. En 1931, Agatha viajaba en el Orient Express cuando este quedó detenido en medio de la noche debido a una tormenta.11. Una de las pasajeras del viaje de Agatha en el Orient Express en 1931, Mrs. Hilton, fue inspiración para Mrs. Hubbard en la novela.12. En febrero de 1929, el Orient Express quedó detenido 6 días producto de una tormenta de nieve en Turquía. 13. Agatha se inspiró en un caso de la vida real para escribir Murder on the Orient Express: el secuestro del pequeño Charles Lindbergh Jr., ocurrido en 1932.14. Aún no sé sabe en dónde realmente se escribió Murder on the Orient Express. Popularmente se cree que fue en el Hotel Pera Palace, en Estambul.15. Murder on the Orient Express fue elegido como el 2do libro favorito de los lectores en 2015, solo detrás de And Then There Were None.16. En 2016, Royal Mail sacó estampillas dedicadas a novelas de Agatha Christie con pistas ocultas; una de ellas corresponde al caso del Orient Express.17. De los tres servicios existentes, Poirot hace su viaje en el Simplon Orient Express en primera clase, en el coche Estambul-Calais.18. En Death on the Nile, Poirot hace alusión al kimono rojo del caso del Orient Express.19. En 2009, el Orient Express realizó su último viaje, cuyo trayecto se limitaba a la ruta París – Viena."
210,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline,Rating 4 out of 5,"In the seventh grade, I read Murder on the Orient Express, either right before or after I read Death on the Nile, without really having any idea who Agatha Christie was. I remember enjoying this a lot and finding it very exciting and suspenseful, and of course the ending blew my mind. Then I pretty much forgot about the book until about a year ago when I did my senior research project on detective novels and spent my summer reading a ton of them. The hotel chain Country Inns and Suites does a thing where they have a shelf of books in their lobbies, and the idea is that you can take a book and return it the next time you're staying in one of their hotels. So when I was staying in the hotel a couple years ago, right before my family and I checked out I was looking at their book selection, mostly out of curiosity. In between all the cheap thrillers and Christian-lit anthologies, lo and behold, there's a copy of Murder on the Orient Express. So obviously I took it, planning to reread it at some point. (sorry, County Inns and Suites, but you probably ain't getting this back)My point is, reading this book again after about ten years was an interesting experience. I knew what the solution was, but it had been long enough that I'd forgotten most of the details of the case and enjoyed rediscovering them. Also, knowing what I now know about detective novels and how they're written, it was really cool to see Christie working behind the scenes of the story, leading the reader to believe in the various red herrings that she put up for them to suspect. However, I have to say that, since I already knew who had done the murder, the middle section (where Poirot interviews all thirteen passengers, one at a time, about where they were and what they did on the night of the murder) got very dull very quickly. But I'm still giving this four stars, because the solution is brilliant and because this book is a perfect example of how detective novels are written, and how the perfect murder is crafted. "

ALL SPOILERS ARE MARKED
disclaimer: this review is not like my usual reviews bc I actually analyze this and not just. scream about the book. but fear not dear friends, I still am the trash talking bish y’all are used tookay, here we go.I have to say I have aways been hesitant about reading classics. I think “oh, they’re like school reading” or “they’re too intelectual for me to read”, but not this book. This is an Agatha Christie book, and the queen of mysteries can entertain anyone, from any age and background. Murder On The Orient Express is a great book. It is centered around one of my favorite tropes of all time, the “the killer is one of us” trope. But Agatha takes it to another level, making the killer not one of the people Poirot is investigating, but all of them.Sure, this book is very short, but it has so many information. It goes through every single suspect more than once, introducing every time a new side of the story. And that’s how murder mysteries should be written, building the suspense and the stakes as we go, unveiling the crime piece by piece.While reading this, I actually noticed some of the clues that were to later become relevant to solving the crime, but I simply discarded them, as Poirot did. That’s one of the reasons I particularly enjoyed Murder On The Orient Express, on the contrast of some of Agatha’s other work, because not only someone on the train committed the crime, but the clues are there all along, you just have to think about it.Overall, I am glad I read this. It’s a refreshing (albeit old) side of murder mysteries that I would like to see more, with a very clever story and even cleverer author."

No me lo esperaba para nada. Obviamente no acerté NADA de lo que pensaba sobre la resolución de este caso, pero creo que es que era prácticamente imposible adivinarlo antes de llegar a las páginas finales (aunque hasta que Poirot no dijo su hipótesis, yo no sospechaba nada de lo que dijo).Creo que, en general, es una buena novela, ya que ha mantenido despierto mi interés todo el tiempo, me ha enganchado bastante y el detective me ha encantado.Lo único que no me ha gustado de esta novela es la enorme cantidad de clichés y estereotipos que dicen los personajes continuamente. Que si los americanos son unos soñadores, que si los ingleses son inacesibles, unos estirados y con un carácter muy frío, que los italianos son asesinos, puffffffffffffffffffffffffffff. Esto llegó a cansarme y a molestarme un poco, ya que cada dos por tres, los personajes de esta novela decían alguno.En resumen: es un libro bastante bueno que me ha dejado con muchas ganas de leer más sobre Hércules Poirot.Para terminar, le voy a dar 4.5 estrellas a este libro (¿CUÁNDO GOODREADS DEJARÁ PONER MEDIAS ESTRELLAS?) porque me ha gustado muchísimo."

221,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13686880-yani,Rating 3 out of 5," 2016 Reading Challenge: #27 Un libro en donde haya un ""murder mistery""  Adoro a Agatha Christie y a sus libros sencillos y entretenidos que no esconden ningún tipo de presunción. También me gusta la gran cantidad de personajes que maneja, siempre manteniéndolos en una línea. Lo que me sucedió particularmente con este libro es que los hilos de la trama se ven, para mi gusto, demasiado pronto y los personajes parecen estar fingiendo que no llegan a la conclusión. “Un par de capítulos más”, piensan, un poco para llevarle la contraria al lector. Pero la previsibilidad no es condenable: el problema es que se deja expuesta una teoría incómoda sobre los extranjeros y los personajes, por ende, están acartonados. Tan acartonados, que las últimas páginas en donde se produce el clímax con la exposición de Poirot me provocaron un “¿eso solo era?”. El argumento es simple: Hercules Poirot está viajando en tren y se cruza con un grupo de personas que tomará el Orient Express. Si bien empieza a delinear el carácter de cada uno de ellos desde el principio, ninguno parece ser el asesino del viajero que aparece muerto en uno de los compartimientos. Así que procederá a interrogarlos uno por uno mientras el tren está detenido por la nieve. Me molestaron las consideraciones que Poirot y sus ayudantes (monsieur Bouc, principalmente) hacen sobre los pasajeros y sus temperamentos de acuerdo a las nacionalidades. Me desentendería del asunto si eso se dijera una sola vez, una especie de desliz en medio del caos, pero en realidad se va a sugerir en otras oportunidades. Parece ser parte del método de investigación de Poirot y no sé si se repite en otros libros. Es comprensible por la época (1934, post guerra) y no es nada que no se siga pensando en este siglo, pero intentar resolver un caso mediante la nacionalidad colérica o fría de una persona roza la ignorancia y el ridículo (por lo menos de la primera se puede volver).  Ergo,  no me gusta. También hay un par de ideas polémicas que vendrían a forzar la explicación del móvil del crimen. No bajé dos estrellas por esto, aunque si influyó un poco en mi perspectiva sobre Poirot y el desarrollo de la novela. Aclaro, para no alarmar (sé que a veces sueno melodramática con estas cosas), que paulatinamente esa idea se abandona y la mira se pone en otros puntos. Se supera, por decirlo de alguna forma. Con respecto a la narración en sí, no presenta dificultades. Cronología que se respeta, detalles sobre los interrogatorios, explicaciones del caso al final y resolución. No tiene novedades hasta la parte final. Lo que me sucedió es que empecé a sospechar en la mitad y se cumplió. Lejos de vanagloriarme de haber adivinado, lo vi como un pequeño defecto porque no soy de las personas que buscan al asesino por sí mismas. Para eso ya está el detective de la novela. Yo me limito a observar cómo se las arregla. Así que definitivamente  Asesinato en el Orient Express  me decepcionó un poco por la relevancia y la estima que tiene este caso en particular. A pesar de lo dicho sobre los personajes acartonados, hay un par que me desorientaron y me gustaron mucho por su temperamento ante la situación. Ya en el comienzo, Mary Debenham y la Princesa Dragomiroff llamaron mi atención. Si bien durante la novela no tienen un desarrollo psicológico ni nada similar (incluso cuando se los presenta como personas que ocultan algo que debe revelarse para hacer un bien mayor), causan cierta simpatía. Todo depende del cristal con que se mire.  Está bien planteada la red en la que todos esos extranjeros quedan pegados el uno al otro. De lo contrario, la trama estaría forzada y fragmentada en personas que estaban en el tren porque sí. No puedo decir que el libro me haya encantado, pero tampoco fue el peor que leí en mi vida. Es muy entretenido y los capítulos invitan a continuar leyendo sin pausa. El suspenso está bien manejado y, a pesar de que Poirot sea un personaje que me cayó mal (tiene un aire de superioridad que traspasa el papel), creo que su mirada de las cosas puede llegar a tener cierta lógica en el contexto.

222,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27283906-arunimaa,Rating 4 out of 5," 4.25 stars Murder on the Orient Express was a lovely read. I had been wanting to read this for a very long time and I am not at all disappointed by it. I actually listened to it-went for the audio narrated by Dan Stevens and he has done an exceptional job with it.This is a book with a  HUGE  cast and that too people from different nationalities and it is not easy to come up with so many different voices and accents, all performed by the same narrator but Dan Stevens was brilliant with his narration and voices. I'd 11/10 recommend the audiobook by him. There are a couple of other versions available, I have noticed. I can't vouch for any of them but the BBC production of the audio seemed very interesting. I listened to the sample and I wanted to listen to the whole thing. It is a full-cast production with all the lovely sound effects. But it's an adapted version, not the exact as the book. So, I wanted to read the original book first and maybe someday later, I'd like to enjoy that version as well. Coming back to the book, I loved the idea of this locked - train rendition of a locked room mystery story. 13 passengers out of which one lays murdered in cold blood in his compartment and the train stuck in a snowdrift, leaving no way for the murderer to get off it. Meaning, they are still somewhere on the train, as one of the 12 passengers. The premise was extremely exciting. This is only my second book by Agatha Christie. The first one happened to be Five Little Pigs which I loved to bits. One thing I noticed that both had a similar repetitive conduct when it came to the narration and progression of the story. I do not know if this is an Agatha Christie thing, but in both, each suspect was approached with the same questions and was asked of their account of the crime in hand. So a lot of things are repeated. In this case, since there were a lot of suspects, there was a good amount of repetition. And it wasn't simply one interview per passenger. Some were summoned more than once. When I point this out, I am not necessarily pointing out flaws. It has its own charm, I suppose. The book is not straightforward. It beats around the bush a lot. Such is the method of Hercule Poirot. He does not reveal what he thinks immediately. Instead, he asks his companions a bunch of questions he knows they will not be able to answer and then acts even more mysterious by simply not coming to the point. This brings me to mention how one of his companions, M. Bouc was such an annoying presence. (I was not actually annoyed by him, as in not annoyed enough to take away any stars or anything.) Boy, was he dumb. The purpose of his presence in the story was solely to ask dumb questions, hastily come to conclusions and then have Poirot correct him, which would, in turn, boost Poirot's ego. It was quite funny when it was not annoying. I was just like, even I am smarter than this man, which says a lot about him.  The ending was delightful. I can't say I am extremely satisfied, probably because the ending had come to me at some point and I had strongly believed for that to not have been possible and instead something more astonishing to happen. So when that did happen, I was slightly,  just slightly,  disappointed. But I had not guessed the entire thing. There were a lot of things that were later revealed that I hadn't actually thought of before. And just the way it all played out, it was so well done, with that flair of drama and poise, that it came off as quite a charming end to the story."
223,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64621419-dennis,Rating 4 out of 5,"It really should have been five stars. But the ending more or less ruined it for me. So I’m giving it what I feel is a generous four.But I’m getting ahead of myself.First of all, I was in an almost unique and very fortunate position here. I’ve either never seen one of the movies or I’ve seen one decades ago and can’t remember. And I had definitely never read the book before. Strange, I know. But this also means I didn’t know how it all plays out. So I was kinda excited to find out.The first eighty percent or so therefore were tremendous fun. It really is the epitome of a page-turner. Christie’s matter-of-fact depiction of Hercule Poirot’s investigation in the murder case made me feel like a detective myself. A rather bad one, it has to be said. Since I missed about half of the clues, or maybe not exactly missed them, but didn’t consider them to be important. In fact, most of them are pretty obvious, but I didn’t always make the right connection and dismissed some as red herrings.I really like the way the build-up is written, even though I didn’t consider Poirot to be a very likeable main character. For my liking he’s a little too confident, bordering on arrogant. But the focus is on the investigation and not the investigator anyway, so that’s fine. The only thing I really missed was a little more descriptions of the route the Orient Express is on, the landscape et cetera. That’s actually something I was looking forward to. But I realized very early on that this won’t be the case here. Especially since the train is snowbound pretty quickly, which, again, I didn’t know. So it’s a case of wrong expectations and I was still leaning towards a five star rating very deep into the book.But I think the twist and the ending are pretty cheap. Now I don’t want to spoil anything for the other three people out there that don’t know the story yet. But let’s just say (and I guess most will understand what I mean) that with that kind of solution to the case Christie has taken some liberties that in a way devalue most or even all of the build-up. And possibly even worse, some of Poirot’s conclusions are really just guesswork, sometimes making assumptions that are outright ridiculous.Furthermore, there’s absolutely no tension towards the end. In front of all the suspects Poirot recaps the case without anybody ever interfering, even when he declares someone guilty. The whole thing really fell kinda flat.In general I find the conclusion hard to believe, even though the clues are there. I just don’t see it happening. And on top of that the ending is also morally questionable. Though that was the least of my problems here.Bottom line: I immensely enjoyed most of the book, but I‘m still hugely disappointed after I’ve finished it. Not a nice way for me to leave the Orient Express. Alas.3.5 stars"

225,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote,Rating 3 out of 5,"Man gets stabby-stabbied 12 times on a train - Belgian dick Hercule Poirot tells us thickos whodunit! Murder on the Orient Express is one of Agatha Christie’s most famous novels though I wouldn’t say it’s among her best. The premise is enticing: a luxury European sleeper train stranded in the middle of the night, a locked room murder mystery, and the killer among the remaining passengers. Also as background to the killing, Christie took inspiration from the scandalous real-life Lindbergh baby kidnapping/murder that shocked the world in the early 1930s. The execution though is wanting. Poirot methodically interviews all of the passengers, slowly going over the repetitive events with ever so slight variations each time, for most of the book which, while understandably necessary, makes for a dry and unexciting read. This approach is why I’m not a huge fan of the genre. Poirot is also not the most fascinating of characters being a quiet, intelligent, polite, and even-tempered gentleman - I’ve never understood his appeal, give me the cocaine-injecting opium dabbler Sherlock Holmes any day of the week! - nor are the other characters any more interesting. That ending though! I was so smug thinking I’d figured out the killer by page 70 but old Aggie was quite the master of deception, wasn’t she? It really is a fantastic and clever resolution. Murder on the Orient Express is a short book but I feel like it could be made even shorter by alternatively reading the story up to the murder and then skipping the dull middle section straight to the resolution. The book has its moments and it’s easy to see why it’s considered a classic but it’s not a white knuckle ride like her best story, And Then There Were None. "

Del resto, non è mai troppo tardi per cercare di sanare almeno una piccolissima parte della propria sconfinata ignoranza.Con quest’autrice, in verità, avevo in programma d’iniziare dal suo celebre classico “Dieci piccoli indiani”, ma poi una cara amica, che ringrazio di cuore, ha provveduto inaspettatamente facendomi dono di quest’altrettanto celebre titolo: et voilà, una splendida lettura davvero sorprendente, su cui salire a bordo proprio come sull’Orient Express!Ricche di echi del vecchio mondo coloniale e del fascino di una mitica tratta ferroviaria che, partendo da Oriente, attraversava buona parte dell’Europa, queste pagine offrono anche un interessante spaccato della società dell’epoca, ormai internazionale e da melting pot americano. Il giallo – manco a dirlo – incuriosisce, coinvolge e cattura, mentre il crimine al centro della narrazione finisce per intrecciarsi a un altro ben più orrendo e lontano nel tempo, sollevando una questione morale con la quale, suo malgrado, si troverà alle prese il geniale Poirot.Finale imprevedibile e stupefacente: un colpo da maestro, degno, a quanto pare, della regina del giallo!

This book was nothing short of brilliant and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery. Her main character, ""Poirot"", is such a wonderful example of the little man with the big brain. No one expects him to be so amazingly brilliant at figuring out these myteries but he does because he uses psychology and imagination. This book is what I'd call ""brain-candy"". You have to learn to be more observant and you get better at it by noticing what Poirot notices. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I plan on delving into more of Agatha Christie's works. Did you know that she is the most widely translated British author in the world, with translations into 103 languages - 14 more than Shakespeare! Wow. "

A genius, my friends.Her books are amazing for so many different reasons. If you haven’t read a Christie book yet, PLEASE DO❗️Even though they were published almost a century ago, her writing reads like contemporary fiction and keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times. It’s never boring and never predictable. They’re also easily bingeable, usually never more than 300 pages. Plus, there’s the brilliant Hercule Poirot - my favorite sassy Belgian.
“What's wrong with my proposition?"" Poirot rose. ""If you will forgive me for being personal - I do not like your face, M. Ratchett.”
 I grew up reading most of Christie’s works when I was a kid since the writing is pretty accessible. Although I knew how this one would end, I still found myself satisfied with the ending and enjoying it just as much as I did when I was younger. Murder on the Orient Express is one of her more popular novels, adapted into several movies as well as presented in the BBC series starring David Suchet. Hercule Poirot, the famous Belgian detective, expects a holiday on the Orient Express, but he can’t seem to catch a break because a man seeks him out, claiming his life is in grave danger. The next morning, he is found in his compartment, stabbed twelve times. Isolated on a train in the middle of the European mountainside, Poirot must find the killer before they strike again.
“The impossible could not have happened, therefore the impossible must be possible in spite of appearances.”
  What I also love about this series is that you don’t have to read the books in any order, and I think this one is a great Christie novel to start off with. And if you weren’t already convinced, Agatha Christie is the original girlboss™️. She wrote these novels during a time where women weren’t respected as writers, and her writing these books broke barriers for women. She was also a surfer, which I think is pretty cool.My audiobook was narrated by Dan Stevens, and his narration was so entertaining. He really brought the book to life for me. Also, the Princess’s voice? Chef’s kiss. In conclusion, GO READ THIS! RIGHT NOW! It’s an absolute must-read. Agatha Christie is an icon, and her books are works of brilliance. Also, our main character is hilarious, and I want to be his best friend."

243,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41874806-bill,Rating 4 out of 5,"I've always had an odd relationship with this Agatha Christie novel. When I first read it, over 30 years ago, I found the start & the end very good while the middle was extremely dull. I always felt it to be one of her weakest novels & even the 1974 film version was very boring. At least the David Suchet TV version from 2010 was an improvement.Then, back in 2017 I saw Kenneth Brannagh's new film version & absolutely loved it. It had the perfect balance of drama, humour & a fast paced plot. So I thought I would return (a little reluctently) to the original 1934 novel & see how I felt about it now.I do still think it drags a little at times, but overall I enjoyed it very much. The dialogue sparkles & Christie creates a huge amount of interesting characters. Poirot's decision at the end of the book (which I won't reveal for those who haven't read the book yet) fits very well with his behaviour in the novel Curtain. However, in the Brannagh film version he wrestles with his conscience much more.I'm really glad that I read this book again & felt (as a more mature reader ?!) differently about it. In contrast I tried to read three of my favourite Miss Marple novels last year & although I enjoyed them in my 20s I found that now I am in my 50s I thought they were rather dull & gave up on every one of them without even bothering to post any reviews. How very odd."

His questioning tactics change with each  individual. And I realized that even more so when he mentioned it in the book itself. Sometimes he just asks yes and no questions, other times he wants to know about feelings and impressions. It's quite fascinating. This case in particular ended with quite a twist.Also, with under 7 hours, this audiobook is a quick and easy read. Perfect for in-between, without feeling overwhelming or like a massive undertaking. These books are simple but cleverly plotted and even more impressive since they were written in 1934.

-He aquí una buena frase- dijo Poirot. Lo imposible no puede haber sucedido; por tanto, lo imposible tiene que ser posible, a pesar de la apariencia.
Primera lectura que hago de la gran dama del género negro, y tengo bien claro que no será la última (de hecho ya me he embarcado en un paseo por el Nilo en Muerte en el Nilo), aunque esta lectura venía con un pelín de handicap por mi parte, y es que ya conocía el final. Pero eso no ha sido motivo para restar ganas en la lectura.Poniéndonos en situación, el simpático detective belga Hercule Poirot se embarca en el famoso tren Orient express en su vuelta a casa, viaje que suele ser muy tranquilo y de poca gente, en el que conocerá a un nutrido grupo de gente, entre los que está un tal Ratchett, un tipo de no muy buena pinta. Este hombre es asesinado durante el trayecto, lo que unido a una nevada que ha bloqueado el tren en su ruta, hará que Poirot deba estrujarse los sesos para averiguar si el asesino ha sido alguien del pasaje o un culpable venido de fuera.Christie tiene una forma muy curiosa de escribir, aunque ya digo que es mi primer acercamiento y no sé si será siempre similar o es esta novela en particular. Pero todo sucede de una manera muy directa, sin necesidad de grandes ambajes a la hora de desarrollar el caso. El famoso detective de grandes bigotes conducirá esta investigación con la sola ayuda de su ingenio y unas entrevistas con cada pasajero, sin tener opción de refuerzos o de ayuda en la búsqueda de la verdad. Y es precisamente Poirot el gran baluarte de la obra, él solito es capaz de llevar el peso de la investigación y de la historia, aunque los personajes secundarios están también bastante conseguidos. La resolución de la trama es muy ingeniosa, y demuestra que esos personajes también estaban bien escritos.
""¡Pero el truco dio resultado!""
Por contra, le he visto un par de cosillas que me han resultado algo cargantes. En particular son dos, que son el cambio constante de idiomas, y las expresiones que se utilizan muchas veces. Sobre el primer tema, es cierto que siendo él francoparlante pueda usar más ese idioma, pero los demás personajes no deberían usarlo tanto. En cuanto al segundo, creo que es más bien una traducción algo anticuada, y si bien se ambienta hace muchos años, creo que le vendría bien una revisión a dicha traducción (por supuesto esto es en la edición que he leído, quizá las más recientes no tengan este problema.La valoración final se queda en 3.5⭐, pero por el desenlace y giro final le redondeo a 4. Una novela que se lee ágilmente y que además cuenta con un protagonista al que le gusta vivir una buena vida y las cosas sencillas, en contraposición a la moda actual. Y después se puede ver una de las varias adaptaciones que tiene a pantalla, que las hay muy buenas.----------------------------
“Here is a good sentence,” said Poirot. The impossible could not have happened, therefore the impossible must be possible in spite of appearances.
My first reading of the great lady of the noir genre, and I can say very clear that it will not be the last (in fact, I have already embarked on a sail along the Nile in Death on the Nile), although this reading came with a bit of a handicap on my part, because I already knew the ending. But that has not been a reason to reduce desire in reading.Putting us in situation, the friendly Belgian detective Hercule Poirot embarks on the famous Orient express train on his return home, a trip that is usually very quiet and with few people, in which he will meet a large group of people, including a certain Ratchett, not a very good-looking fellow. This man is murdered during the journey, which, together with a snowfall that has blocked the train on its route, will cause Poirot to rack his brains to find out if the murderer was someone from the passage or a culprit from outside.Christie has a very curious way of writing, although I already say that it is my first approach and I don't know if it will always be similar or if it is this novel in particular. But everything happens in a very direct way, without the need for great ambiguity when developing the case. The famous detective with the big mustache will conduct this investigation with the sole help of his ingenuity and interviews with each passenger, without having the option of reinforcements or help in the search for the truth. And Poirot is precisely the great pillar of this work, he alone is capable of carrying the weight of the investigation and the story, although the secondary characters are also quite accomplished. The resolution of the plot is very clever, and shows that those characters were well written as well.
""But the trick worked!""
On the other hand, I have seen a couple of little things that have been somewhat burdensome to me. In particular there are two, which are the constant change of languages, and the expressions that are used many times. On the first issue, it is true that since he is a French speaker he can use that language more, but the other characters should not use it as much. As for the second one (having read it translated) I think it is rather an outdated translation, and although it is set many years ago, I think it could use a revision to said translation (of course this is in the edition that I have read, perhaps the most recent don't have this problem.The final rating remains at 3.5⭐, but due to the outcome and final twist, I round it up to 4. A novel that is easy to read and also has a protagonist who likes to live a good life and do simple things, as opposed to the current fashion. And then you can see one of the various adaptations that it has on the screen, which are very good."

252,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4636758-vanessa,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 stars. This was my second Agatha Christie, and although it didn't disappoint, it definitely didn't hold up to And Then There Were None, which I read earlier in the year.Hercule Poirot is travelling home on the Orient Express to start a new case, when surprise surprise, a murder happens! The man in question is an unlikeable millionaire, and all evidence points to the murderer being one of the other passengers, but which one? Poiriot interviews each passenger, collates the evidence, makes some big reveals, and presents his resolution.The book is very methodical in the way it is written, much like Poirot's approach to solving the case. The first part deals with the murder itself, and the events leading up to it. The second part deals with Poirot's interviews with the other people on the train and collation of the evidence. The third part is when he then analyses the evidence and comes up with his solution. And I did like that structure - you knew exactly where you were in the story at all points, and it helped you to also analyse the evidence along with Poirot. Of course, I didn't work it out because Agatha Christie's mind is very complex, but it's fun anyway.I think the main issue I had with this though was that it just seemed too convenient. The wrapping up of the mystery was done in a very quick and succinct way, and I felt that everything was just too coincidental. Of course, this is obviously going to be the case because it's a mystery novel, and you expect there to be a big reveal, but I just felt that everything wrapped up a little too neatly and felt a bit ridiculous.Overall though I enjoyed this book, and I'd definitely like to continue with checking out more of Agatha Christie's work."

Няма как отново да не спомена увлекателният стил на писане на авторката – тя за пореден път ме накара да си задавам въпроса „Кой е убиецът?” през цялото време на читателския процес. Действието се развива във влака Ориент Експрес, който бързо се превръща с сцена на убийство, след като засяда в снежна преспа, а заможен американец е открит мъртъв в купето си. По всичко изглежда, че убиецът е все още сред колоритните, крайно различни един от друг, пътници във влака, а задачата на Поаро да разкрие кой е той се усложнява допълнително от алибитата на всеки един от тях и необяснимите улики, които изскачат по време на разследването. С течение на сюжета се разбира по малко за миналото на всеки един от героите, както и за истинската самоличност на жертвата, а краят отново е неочакван и напрегнат.Определено се насладих на всяка една страница от книгата!"

Comunque ho letto anche il libro e posso dirvi che, nonostante conoscessi già il finale, la trama e lo stile mi hanno coinvolta tanto. Poirot non ha nulla da invidiare a Sherlock Holmes, hanno due metodi investigativi diversi (e due personalità agli antipodi): il film del 2017 presenta differenze sostanziali, ma il personaggio di Poirot, la trama e la sottotrama (ovvero la storia del rapimento e dell'uccisione di Daisy Armstrong) rimane invariata. Ovviamente all'inizio fai fatica a farti un'idea precisa di chi possa essere stato perché ci sono troppi alibi e troppe incongruenze che portano a pensare che sia stato un misterioso essere salito e sceso dal treno in una notte. Però seguendo i ragionamenti di Poirot, piano piano ti accorgi che tutto è riconducibile ad un piano ben più organizzato, al quale nessuno dei lettori poteva esserci arrivato. La vendetta umana non conosce limiti e Poirot, che non giudica nessuno, capisce che non può che capire queste 12 persone, tutte legate da un unico dolore."

269,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18562856-puck,Rating 3 out of 5,"Choo-choo, everyone aboard!  The Orient Express movie just released and while I’m sure it’s entertaining, I was more excited that the movie gave me a reason to pick up my first Agatha Christie book. 
Murder on the Orient Express
 is a clever mystery set in an unique location, and while the interesting characters added a lot of flavor, the book let me down a bit. The setting is simple yet very visualizing: we have the famous Orient Express train stranded in the snow, one man who got murdered in his sleep, and 12 people from different nationalities and classes that all can be the possible killer. It’s up to little Belgium detective Hercule Poirot to solve the case, but the passengers and the strange clues certainly don’t make it easy for him. Christie does an amazing job at bringing all these different personalities to life with just a few sentences, making them all stand out in their own way; an impressive feat with such a large cast. And for a novel first published in 1934, the writing never feels outdated: Poirot’s clear thought-process isn’t only precise but also filled with great dry humor. 
 “Lies - and again lies - it amazes me, the amount of lies we had told to us this morning.”“There are more still to discover”, said Poirot cheerfully.“You think so?”“I shall be very disappointed if it is not so.” 
However, it’s that clear structure that brought the overall story down for me. By solemnly following Poirot investigation, there is no build-up suspense or feeling of tension present in this story. We don’t get to fear the murderer striking again and something going wrong with the snowed-in train, because we only read about Poirot. This lack of thrills disappointed me, because the central mystery does show potential for it.The finale on the other hand came as a great shock: I had my own ideas about the killer, but I had never imagined something so clever and complex. So for an old mystery, this novel is still compelling and impressive today, and Hercule Poirot certainly deserves his place among other famous detectives."

U tim serijama nije bilo akcije, jurnjave ili pucnjave, delovale su mi nekako sporo, tromo i dosadno. Nisam imao pojma da takve serije treba da se gledaju predano, udobno zavaljeno u fotelji i sa budnim umom. Da je svaka reč bitna, da je svaki pokret bitan, svaki tik, svaki mig...Ovo mi je prvi put da čitam Agatu Kristi. Udobno sam se zavalio, spremio veliku šolju Ness kafe i popeo se na voz. Voleo bih da mogu da vam kažem da sam čitao predano (jesam u smislu da sam za tri sata pročitao dve trećine knjige), primetio sam svašta, ali vrlo često nisam pridodavao tome značaja. Pustio sam da me priča vodi, trčkarao sam za Poaroom kao Buk, hvatajući mrvice tu i tamo, sumnjao na ovoga ili onoga, u jednom trenutku pomislivši da znam ko je ubica i bio sam spreman da odložim knjigu uz „meh“, kad me je Poaro ponovo zbunio.„Stvarno to mislite? Zar niste slušali šta sam pričao?“Na kraju sam video sebe kako bespomoćno sedim u vagon-restoranu okružen svim tim putnicima i u čudu nemoćno dižem ruke u vazduh, dok nas Poaro zadivljuje svojom moćnom dedukcijom. U tom trenutku sam poželeo da sam izašao iz voza u Vinkovcima i samo nastavio u hladnu noć.Moć kojom je ova žena umela da iznese misteriju i da nešto poput gledanje kroz prozor u snežni nanos učini bitnim je neverovatna. Likovi, motivi, alibiji, pozadinska priča... već sam video zidove svoje sobe izlepljene slikama osumnjičenih, sa kratkim porukama ispod svake i raznobojnim končićima koji bi spajali likove, motive i priče... i siguran sam da je ne bih rešio...Ovo je bila prva, znam sigurno da neće biti poslednja i znam da ću se njenim knjigama vraćati u pauzama između velikih saga, kako bih razdrmao i razgibao usnuli um.Hm... čujete li to?

Publicada por primera vez en 1934, la obra es considerada una de las obras maestras de la autora y una de las mejores novelas de detectives jamás escritas.La trama gira en torno al famoso detective belga Hercule Poirot, quien se encuentra a bordo del lujoso tren Orient Express. Durante el viaje, se produce un asesinato en el cual un acaudalado hombre de negocios llamado Ratchett es apuñalado brutalmente en su compartimento. Poirot es solicitado para resolver el caso, y mientras entrevista a los pasajeros, descubre que muchos de ellos tienen motivos para querer ver muerto a Ratchett.Lo que hace que Asesinato en el Orient Express sea particularmente intrigante es el ingenioso giro que toma la trama. Sin revelar demasiado, el desenlace del misterio es inesperado y desafía las convenciones típicas del género. Agatha Christie presenta a los lectores un rompecabezas intrincado y astutamente elaborado que mantiene su suspense hasta el final.La novela también destaca por su caracterización experta y variada de los personajes. Cada pasajero del tren tiene su propia historia y motivación, lo que agrega profundidad a la trama y aumenta la complejidad del misterio.

My honest interest arose for this book, when I watched promos for the movie advertise. I prefer to read the book, before I watch the movie..Anyway moving swiftly on. I liked Christie’s description of the settings and her dynamic use of characters. Poirot reminded me of a French Sherlock Holmes. However I did find Poirot used his intuition to solve the majority of his findings, a gift I suppose, but not what I expected from a detective. As I said I am not a vivid mystery genre reader, but I didn��t expect the majority of the book to be based around interviews and evidence. I guess I wanted a bit more drama maybe? Something a little more.. I was pleasantly surprised with the ending, I wasn’t expecting the twist at all."

It was fun trying to solve the mystery, right up to the point where it became obvious that the solution was the obvious one. I must admit to feeling a bit put out with Christie, after all, how many persons connected with an American murder could find themselves on the same train?  but then I realized Christie was playing with me, and it made me chuckle at my own denseness.

Also I really want to dive into the movie again just to see all the amazing actors that I love.I just kind of wish it was predictable this time around. Even thought I last read this in 2017, I still remembered a lot of what happened. Or maybe it's because I finished Agatha's Miss Marple series recently and that's why I know what clues to look for.

So, of course I started from the first book within this series. Since then I've fallen in love with Agatha Christie and the way she writes. I was so happy when I finally got to this book that I wanted to savor it! Too bad I still ended up gobbling it up. Murder on the Orient Express brings Poirot back into our lives. I can't believe I've missed this character so much but he made me laugh right off the bat in this book. Telling Ratchett that he didn't want to take on his case because he doesn't like his face?!?! I couldn't stop laughing at his response. It just seems to be a totally and completely normal response for good ole' Poirot.Too bad for Poirot because it's get the case in the end due to Ratchett's death on the train. Kind of ironic but in the end the book was so good. I'm sad to say that I did figure out who did it and everything before it came clear. Sad? Yes, because lately I felt that I was off my game with trying to figure out the murder case before it was revealed. Plus, I was so freaking excited to read this book that I thought it would be way harder to solve than the previous books. So, yeah.. I'm sad now.Now I'm not saying that this book was bad or terrible or anything like that. Because it wasn't. It was so good that I;m going to recommend it to everyone that I see on my way to work tomorrow. I just love Agatha's books and I can't wait to read more of them."

However, the individual interrogations/interviews helped a lot. Can old women be cozy? Cause if they can, Mrs. Hubbard is cozy.A cozy busybody, but nonetheless. I understand why they all got so sick of hearing about her daughter. I don't think I could let Ratchett get by without telling me anything. I'm not McQueen. I'm nosy. lol Really enjoyed the valet on the audio. He sounded exactly like Snape somehow. Man, Princesses and Colonels and Counts and Countesses all aboard one train. Fancy. And to think they're all killers. Well, and accomplices. I don't blame them at all. Any man who has 12 unrelated people willing to kill him in cold blood probably did something- even if Poirot didn't explain what he did.I mean, if Ratchett already had the letter, why wait to get someone to investigate? Just to chance meeting Poirot on the train and then chance him taking the case? Ummm, I doubt it. Here's the thing about this plot. After Ratchett is killed, nothing actually happens. Interviews and that's it. No real action. And yet..., somehow I was rapt. I hung on every word from these people and just guessed (much like Poirot himself) what was going to be exposed next.  Gotta say I wasn't expecting that. The entire book I was trying to pinpoint which two people would have worked together. I love how at the end, they all agree to let it go and get away with the whole thing, and with Poirot backing them, the police wouldn't ask questions. It appears the key to a successful murder is to collect enough people who want someone dead in one place. Poirot just straight up said, Yeah not gonna take your case cause I don't like your face. Big oofWomen are like that. They have great strength when they are enraged. Man, he's just trying to shift some blame. TsktskUse the little grey matter of the mind.

286,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41243494-brittany-whatbritreads,Rating 4 out of 5,"My first ever Agatha Christie novel! I’m so glad I enjoyed it. I really love Sherlock Holmes and to me this gave off quite a similar vibe, so I’m really glad this has been recommended to me.I was surprised at how easy this was to pick up and get into. Most crime novels are quite bagged down with description and lengthy paragraphs but this felt very straight to the point, which in the beginning made it ridiculously easy to follow. I picked it up just to see if I could read a chapter or two before bed, but before I knew it I was a hundred pages deep. It kept this consistent, snappy pacing and prose throughout. It felt very accessible and easy to dip in and out of for me.I really liked the storyline and honestly I’m surprised to say I had never been spoiled for this book thus far so the plot twist ending was actually a surprise to me and I loved it. I thought it was pretty creative and I wouldn’t have been able to guess it in a million years. I found that after the big reveal the book did end a little bit abruptly and there was no closure, but it seemed to work for the styles of writing somehow. I wasn’t too mad at it.Poirot was great as a protagonist and a detective, it was good to finally read about and warm to a character whose name I’ve heard endless times over the years.The thing that brought my rating down for this novel was the eventual confusion I felt. As more and more characters and backstories get introduced in a very finite number of pages, it was hard for me personally to get to grips with everybody and their relationship. I mostly understood the ending, but I don’t feel like the connections all solidified and made total sense to me. I think stripped back a little, it would’ve packed more of a punch. But I really liked it, and would be eager to read more Poirot in the future."

I should kick myself for not taking part sooner. There is a reason she is hailed as the Mystery Queen and I'm so glad I chose Murder on The Orient Express to be my first foray into her series.  Hercule Poirot is the gem of all gems, a tiny french man with a plump somewhat unnoticeable physique uses other's misconceptions and frankly under-estimations of him to his advantage. Constantly poising odd questions, or feigning ignorance to get a glance into the true inward workings of his suspects. The characters aka the suspects were all brilliantly depicted. The suspects at 13 + characters could have easily become a mosaic of forgettable and underdeveloped cast of people leaving the reader confused at all times, and check back on chapters already read to help differentiate who's who. But Agatha Christie develops her characters with such rich colour and texture that everyone is cemented into the readers mind and you are able to complete immerse yourself into the mystery without any confusion. AND THAT ENDING!!!! No spoilers obviously but my god what a ending. I didn't figure it out till the last couple of chapters and even then I was still second guessing myself, like ""it can't be, that's too crazy!!!"" I am newly converted Agatha Christie addict, I am now going to ask people if they've read Agatha Christie novel and if they say no I will scorn them like a person whose read more then one Agatha Christie novel. I will have the bravado of a season pro fan so I better start backing up my new found love by getting my ass to the nearest bookstore and getting some more of this brilliant detective series. "

The layout of the chapters was much appreciated. Everything was presented in a beautiful ordered format.First we meet Hercule Poirot. He is told he must come back to Paris from Istanbul immediately. He finds it difficult to make reservations on the Orient Express. There are many more people on the train than is usual for the time of year. Once on the train, he meets Ratchett, who is afraid that he is about to be killed. Poirot has no liking for him and refuses to get involved. Of course, he IS killed. Poirot, M. Bouc, a director of the rail line, and Dr. Carpenter, the attending physician devise a plan to ferret out the killer or killers. They are sure that the killer(s) are still on the train because the train has been caught in a snow drift and has not been able to proceed. The group interrogates 12 different passengers who are ensconced in the Athens-Paris coach. One of them has to be the killer.As stated earlier, everything is presented in an orderly fashion and detailed in three parts: The Facts, The Evidence and Hercule Poirot Sits Back and Thinks.My only problem with the book is that I became like a deer in the headlights when Poirot presented his line of thinking as to how the killing played out. The edition of this book that I read was based on the movie starring Johnnie Depp as Ratchett. I had to find out who killed Johnnie (!!), so could not put the book down.Recommend to mystery lovers everywhere.4 stars"

Pero sí puedo daros mi opinión sobre mi primera lectura de ella después de muchos, muchos años sin leerla. La verdad es que no defrauda. A pesar de tener ya sus libros unos cuantos añitos, su escritura es tan fluida, tan bien estructurada y tan entretenida que en ningún momento te acuerdas de que estás leyendo un clásico. Bueno vale, no es un clásico como leer a Shakespeare, pero es un clásico.Me encanta la imaginación de esta mujer y cómo hila en sus historias hasta el más mínimo detalle. Sin duda se percibe en cada frase su fina educación y su gran bagaje cultural debido a la vida que tuvo.Os tengo que decir que con mi memoria de pez no recordaba nada de esta historia, incluso he llegado a pensar en que no lo había leído así que lo he disfrutado como una enana. Es un libro para sentarse y tomar notas al más puro estilo Poirot, me he sentido como una escape room, pensando en las pistas cuando iba conduciendo y descartando culpables según se sucedían los hechos.Así que nada, lo único que os puedo decir es que si todavía queda alguien que no conozca a esta autora, por favor colarla como sea entre vuestras lecturas, coged uno de sus libros cuando tengáis un bloqueo lector, leedla si estáis escribiendo vuestro propio libro o simplemente elegidla si queréis ir sobre seguro.Creo que seguiré con Muerte en el Nilo aprovechando que acaban de estrenar una peli sobre él."

""Asesinato en el Orient Express"" cuenta un caso de asesinato a bordo de este tren en el cual viajan personalidades diversas desde princesas hasta institutrices y en el cual Hércules Poirot será requerido para develar el crimen.No me causó la misma impresión que ""Diez Negritos"" y en general me encuentro con los mismos problemas que encuentro en todas las novelas de misterio policíaco como ""El halcón maltés"", el estilo narrativo relativamente pobre, la descripción exagerada de detalles propios de toda investigación pero que me aburren pues son descripciones que no enseñan casi nada, y los clichés (la mujer joven hermosa pero fría y calculadora, el extremo lucimiento del detective, Etc.)Lo que más me gustó fue la maestría obvia para poder crear esta novela y las situaciones que se conectan a lo largo de la historia, así como la manera de analizar los datos hasta el mínimo detalle de Hércules Poirot. No sé si los interrogatorios sumarios son una constante en los casos de Poirot pero ciertos sucesos como éste me aburrieron un poco. Creo que el final me gustó mucho por ello pongo mi calificación tan alta."

An American tycoon lies dead in his compartment, stabbed a dozen times and his door is locked from the inside. Isolated with a killer in their midst, the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot entertains us with his unprecedented ability to identify the murderer. This was my first Agatha Christie novel and it definitely did not disappoint. It's amazing how Ms. Christie was able to weave this intricate mystery in only 200 pages. The plot is so delicious. The characters are fascinating. No electronics whatsoever and there is no way to research anything other than by asking questions. The writing style shows how politely people used to talk in that period of time and you will notice that Ms. Christie scattered some French expressions and phrases that wouldn't affect the reader's understanding of the dialogue.You can find amazing contemporary mysteries these days, but in my humble opinion, they have nothing on Agatha Christie. This is a classic killer mystery- pun absolutely intended. You like mysteries? You should read this."

I wish I could think like Hercule Poirot. 

“The impossible could not have happened, therefore the impossible must be possible in spite of appearances.”

302,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7620837-frank,Rating 5 out of 5,"Murder on the Orient Express was first published in 1934 and is considered by many to be one of Christie's masterpieces. It was originally published in the U.S. under the title Murder in the Calais Coach. It is the tenth novel featuring Hercule Poirot and takes place mainly in the Calais Coach of the Orient Express. In the novel, Poirot had been in Syria and expected to spend some time in Istanbul but received a telegram summoning him back to London. He makes a booking on the Orient Express which is almost completely booked which is unusual in the winter. Among the passengers is a man named Ratchett who has an appearance of evil and who ends up being murdered by multiple stab wounds. The murder occurred as the train was stuck in a snow drift and couldn't be moved. So Poirot is called to investigate by his friend who is the director of the train line. Turns out there are a myriad of clues and red herrings. Ratchett is found to be a kidnapper who was let off in the states after a most heinous crime resulting in the death of a young girl as well as some family members. The clues all point to someone in the Calais coach as the murderer because no one could leave the train since it was stranded in the snow. So what really happened and can Poirot get to the bottom of the case? (The inspiration for this novel is obviously the Lindbergh kidnapping in 1932.)I have been a fan of Christie's for years but for some reason I had never read this one even though it is one of her most celebrated novels. I remember seeing the 1974 movie version of this many years ago and as I read the novel some of my recollections from the movie must have come through to my memory because it did seem very familiar. There was also a remake of the film in 2017 with Kenneth Branagh and Johnny Depp and the copy of the novel I read is a movie tie-in to that film. I guess I need to watch that one. Anyway, I would consider this to be one of Christie's best and would recommend it. I will also be reading more of her works . . . although I've read quite a few of them, I don't think I've hardly scratched the surface of her prolific output."

La nieve les deja varados en lo que era Yugoslavia. Hay un asesinato, y los sospechosos estan a bordo del tren. El porqué es pronto revelado, pero no el quién donde todos son sospechosos.Me temo que el ver las peliculas (he visto varias versiones) me arruinó el libro. Las actuaciones de los personajes a quien se les deja espacio para moverse se ve muy bien en escena, pues parece más como una obra de teatro (como llega hasta comentar Poirot), aunque tiene también espacio para lucirse en el cine.

«Durante tres días estas gentes, extrañas unas a otras, vivirán reunidas. Dormirán y comerán bajo el mismo techo, no podrán separarse. Al cabo de los tres días seguirán distintos caminos para no volver, quizás, a verse. 	—Y, sin embargo —dijo Poirot—, supongamos que un accidente… 	—¡Ah, no, amigo mío!… 	—Desde su punto de vista sería de lamentar, estoy de acuerdo. Pero supongámoslo por un momento. Entonces todos nosotros seguiríamos unidos… por la muerte.»Interesante sí, el seguir el razonamiento del detective siguiendo las pistas que se le presentan y llegando a una conclusión inesperada. Igualmente se disfruta con la ironía sutil de Poirot y su humor. en contrapunto a las conclusiones de su amigo y en respuesta a lo que le responden algunos.El final tan abrupto, por otra parte, terminó de bajarle una estrella. Me quedo mejor con los finales tragicos que han presentado, como el Poirot interpretado por Suchet, que siempre termina enfatizando la maldad."
304,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley,Rating 4 out of 5,"So I'm going to confess up front that I did a very bad thing. When I got about halfway through this, I decided it would be a great idea to spoil myself completely on the ending. I don't know why I do this. It's like once a mystery's got me, I can't even wait five minutes to find out how it turns out. Wikipedia and the Internet are terrible enablers in this habit of mine. And yes, I've done it before, though never to a Christie. Usually I spoil myself because I'm stressed out, but here, I have no excuse. This book was as delightful and comforting as Poirot books usually are. And I didn't like the book any less for knowing what was coming. Like with so many of the best Christie books, the ending completely changes the way you look at the rest of the story, and you don't see it coming, usually even if you're trying. I also have a feeling this book would be very fun to re-read, just to see how she laid in all the clues without you knowing. This is probably one of her most famous books, and for good reason. Just for the ending alone, it's now in my top five. (There's also a new film being made of this, with a pretty fun looking cast: Leslie Odom Jr, Daisy Ridley, Penelope Cruz, Josh Gad, Kenneth Branagh . . . and ugh, Johnny Depp. But at least he's the one getting murdered.)I would also highly recommend the audiobook, particularly the version I listened to, which had Dan Stevens as the narrator. That man has a voice like butter. And he's really good at doing voices! Like sometimes I would forget that it was only one person reading the whole time. What a handsome, talented man."

This may be because of burn out at a young age. After devouring the entire Nancy Drew series, I had an epiphany one day that went something like this: ""I don't give a damn who did it."" It was like someone flipped a switch and I went cold turkey on mysteries (I even remember starting Murder on the Orient Express as a teen and thinking, ""Nope. I think I'll go get a Piers Anthony book instead"").However, I have since retracted this book's status as being forcibly thrust upon me because I actually enjoyed it. Color me surprised. Normally, I have these suckers figured out long before the end. After much sighing as I turned each page, knowing in my heart of hearts who the murderer was, imagine my shock when I was wrong. Really. I was. Dead wrong. The ending was, well, genius--and I shall say no more.Having said that, this is not great writing. I had to roll my eyes every time Poirot's eyes ""twinkled"" and it's chockfull of stereotypes, but that's not the point. The mark of a good mystery is that it keeps one guessing until the end, and Aggie (that's what I like to call her) certainly did her job well."
307,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 Stars. Several times made into a movie. Among the most famous detective mysteries of all time. Christie's great Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, pulls it out of the fire again as only he can. He's on a short vacation and the luxury train gets stuck in the Balkans in a terrible snow storm, thus ensuring the author's usual premise - it is most likely that the murderer is still present during the investigation which follows (in this case on the train as a passenger, employee, or criminal of some type). Even though you might know the solution from a previous read or from a movie adaptation, ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is still worth another look to watch Agatha Christie craft one of her best. So many suspects and so many disparate clues. There's the cry in the night and the mysterious dressing gown. Oh, and the handkerchief emblazoned with an 'H'. Look at the initial list of suspects, from Princess Dragomiroff to Antonio Foscarelli; they're from all over the place. Get set for a great deal of misdirection and a dilemma for the ages: did the victim deserve this fate? The least I can say on that is, his last name, Ratchett, suited him. (April 2017)"

319,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20065569-jim-dooley,Rating 5 out of 5,"A Note About Spoilers: I don't intend to reveal Whodunit, but I do want to talk about Clues! MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS was the rare murder mystery reading experience for me because I knew the solution before I'd started. Two film versions contributed to that. So, for this reading, I had the opportunity to sit back and enjoy the craft of how Agatha Christie put her story together. Not unlike Arthur Conan-Doyle, the Agatha Christie who had reached this point in her writing career Really Knew her Readers! First of all, there is the title of the book itself. Before the cover has even been opened, it suggests an exotic ... and perhaps a darkly romantic ... thriller. The book itself almost screams, ""Read me!"" Obviously, mystery writers want to develop believable characters in a believable situation. It is also important to develop a ""mystery trail"" that will ""play fair"" with the Reader. If one is clever enough, there should be sufficient clues provided to lead to the solution. Yet, as I mentioned before, Christie knew her Readers, which meant that she knew how they would react and interpret what was written. In this case, she set up some clues that the Reader will immediately discard because they seem unimportant. An excellent example of this is that it is set at the time of year when bookings on the Orient Express are sluggish. Yet, on this train trip, the car promised to Hercule Poirot is full. Any Reader who has had certain travel expectations and found them ""turned on their head"" will likely think, ""Yes, that does happen"" and move on. Christie also excels at misdirection. For instance, she suggests early on that the murder was committed by a man and a woman, one of whom was left-handed. Despite Poirot's cautioning his companions (and, through them, the Reader) multiple times that they should not jump to conclusions, the evidence seems very logically presented. So, despite Poirot's protests, the Reader will have a tendency to prioritize all forthcoming clues as to whether they support the theory. Also, there are clues that seem unimportant because of chronology. When Poirot asks where a certain person lives now, the response is that the character doesn't know because it has been so many years in the past since they last saw each other and people lose track. The natural inclination of the Reader is to agree. After all, how many people do we remember from our school years (for instance) and have absolutely no idea of what became of them? Besides, that was years ago, and the crime happened very recently! I smiled many times while reading as I saw what Christie was doing. Brilliant! (And I laughed out loud at Poirot's deflated ego when one character, who recalls having heard the name ""Hercule Poirot"" before, thought he was a women's dressmaker.) If MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS had a fault for me, it is that it concluded very, very suddenly. The solution to the crime is revealed ... so, we're done! There's no sense in writing anything further. Yet, perhaps that was another example of Christie understanding her Readers. I happen to like a short, concluding scene that provides some emotional closure. However, maybe her Readers prefer to get on with their lives just as soon as the mystery is solved. Ah, it doesn't matter. I thoroughly enjoyed my journey on the Orient Express ... despite knowing ahead of time exactly what would happen when I reached my ""destination."" (I'm also looking forward to reading DEATH ON THE NILE which falls into the same ""I know the solution"" category.) "

322,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52357224-kaleah,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.25 ⭐️s!I don’t know why I never read Agatha Christie growing up, but I wanted to read Murder on the Orient Express before seeing the movie. I ended up purchasing the Kenneth Branagh narrated Audible version. It was great! Branagh did a really good job bringing the characters to life. Some people mentioned his adaptation of American accents were over the top and distractingly annoying, but some of that I believe was by design (the characters were being over the top themselves). His European accents were top notch.This is a classic mystery, a who-done-it that keeps you guessing until the end. Although there’s some suspense, this is a good example of a mystery being distinctly different from a thriller. I believe many modern writers tend to blur the lines of mysteries and thrillers.I loved the setup of this story. The writing was lush and descriptive, transporting the reader to a faraway land (for me anyway) in the dead of winter. I wanted to visit these places: the train station in Aleppo, the hotel in Istanbul, have a meal in the dining car on the Orient Express. I loved the diverse nationalities of the characters, and was particularly fond of the British Indian Colonel. I also enjoyed how most of the clues Poirot picked up on, the reader could have potentially tied together to form suspect possibilities, although I doubt the full picture would have come together for anyone. Poirot is very methodical during the investigation process, so in some parts the pace slowed down a bit, but it’s worth staying engaged in order to discover Poirot’s investigative conclusions. Some suspension of disbelief is necessary, but I was satisfied with the ending. Now I’m going on an Agatha Christie binge!!"
323,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2630602-tarissa,Rating 5 out of 5,"Now, THAT is a murder mystery for the books! Whew! Agatha sure knew how to write 'em. Now I understand why this title is such a popular classic. (If you haven't read Murder on the Orient Express, you just should.) ... What a flabbergasting, jaw-dropping solution -- by none other than Mr. Hercule Poirot.As is the case of many Christie plots... a murder takes place, an entire cast of witnesses and suspects is produced, and Poirot uses his little gray cells for all they're worth, until a suitable answer appears as to the murderer's identity. This murder event just happens to take place on a snowbound train in Europe. With no footprints in the snow leading away, it's safe to surmise that the killer is still roaming among the locomotive's society. (Except, of course, that's not safe at all, for the living!)The book is set up in an ever-so-precise way of each chapter corresponding to an individual witness's report. It's done in a way of tallying up the evidence from every angle, very categorically. (It makes for a fun, yet strategic, read.)Overall, this one is pretty amazing. Also, it's unforgettable."
324,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana,Rating 4 out of 5,"I haven't read Agatha Christie's books in a while and almost forgot what a great murder mystery writer she was. ""Murder on the Orient Express"" was an excellent example of a mystery done right. An ensemble of colorful characters, secrets, the perfectly presented investigative method. What else can you expect from a mystery novel? I found myself eagerly following Hercule Poirot along each step of his investigation, trying to figure out who the murderer was, but alas, I never succeeded. But I am going to give myself credit for some partial discoveries.Great story. I will definitely read more of Christie's books.Reading challenge: #30, 1 of 2."

So I decided to read another book which was ""And then there were none"" and it became an insta-Fav book with an easy 5 stars, This book just came to prove the same thing and it restored my love for crime novels and Agatha really deserves the title ""The Queen of crime"", I will sure be reading more Agatha books soon!"

Después de un poco de haber comenzado su lectura no pude dejar de leer e indagar sobre el como se resolvería el caso. Realmente un libro que atrapa y una vez empiezas a leerlo no quieres soltarlo. La pluma de Agatha Christe es increíble, como te va enganchando y confundiendo todo el tiempo para que no logres descifrar quien es el verdadero asesino (al menos a mi me pasa); el final es simplemente sorprendente.Libro tren de primavera cabina Reino UnidoLibro para libros, libros y más libros insciso 4a"

A perfect setting for a classic murder mystery novel.Murder on the Orient Express is one of Agatha Christie's most famous novels, and it shows. The sheer brilliance of the author in utilizing the different characters, placing the red herrings and setting the scene is evident throughout the novel.Its safe to say that the plot is genius, with Agatha Christie's writing making the readers keep guessing what's to come next, only to fail again and again."

Agatha Christie was the one that introduced me to this genre a couple of decades  years ago. ;)All her books aged extremely well as her prose is simple but effective. Don't take any word used for granted. She chose them carefully, as you will discover at each one of her books. Murder on the Orient Express was first published on 1934 and it has been, since then, a favorite among this book genre lovers.Could you guess who was the assassin? ;)"
