A woman who would tell one that, would tell one anything.” “After a good dinner one can forgive anybody, even one’s own relations.”“To get into the best society, nowadays, one has either to feed people, amuse people, or shock people - that is all!”“We in the House of Lords are never in touch with public opinion. That makes us a civilised body.”Even if you have never come across these particular quotations before, you might be likely to guess correctly at their author. Oscar Wilde excelled in writing light and witty, drawing room satires, plays containing line after line such as these. However, his 1893 play A Woman of No Importance, is a curious mix of this type he wrote so well, and a more serious and bitter condemnation of social mores, which we would more readily expect from his contemporary fellow Irish playwright, George Bernard Shaw. Both authors lived partly during the Victorian era, when women had very few rights compared with men, and this is often highlighted in the plays of George Bernard Shaw, but not so often in Oscar Wilde’s. With this play, Oscar Wilde too has decided to explore some of the double standards of the end of the nineteenth century.However at the start of A Woman of No Importance, this is not yet apparent. We are on familiar territory: the drawing rooms and gardens of the rich and powerful, where Lord, Ladies, and occasionally members of the clergy meet to socialise and gossip about their contemporaries.We are ready for drolleries and sizzling satire; we are ready for Oscar Wilde’s wickedly unkind put-downs, and we are not disappointed: “The happiness of a married man depends on the people he has not married.”“Men marry because they are tired; women because they are curious. Both are disappointed.”“Talk to every woman as if you loved her, and to every man as if he bored you, and at the end of your first season you will have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact.” “My dear young lady, there was a great deal of truth; I dare say, in what you said, and you looked very pretty while you said it, which is much more important.” The First Act is set on the terrace at Hunstanton Chase. As the play opens, we meet Lady Caroline Pontefract on the garden terrace. A party is being held, and the privileged upper class guests are exchanging social gossip and small talk. Lady Caroline Pontefract enthusiastically holds forth, giving her opinion on everyone and everything in her social milieu. We become aware very quickly, that not only is she wealthy and a member of the aristocracy, but that she holds everyone else in disdain, and enjoys holding court and displaying her power to her own advantage. Lady Caroline Pontefract, along with Lady Jane Hunstanton, is ostensibly welcoming Hester Worsley, a wealthy young American who is visiting England for the first time, but in fact she is using all her effort to criticise and make those around her feel as small and worthless as possible. She is certainly providing many amusing lines for the audience to appreciate. However the play is not really about her. One of the people Lady Caroline denigrates is a young clerk, called Gerald Arbuthnot, but young Hester Worsley objects, defending him. This young American woman is remarkably direct and confident, compared with the English young ladies of her time and class. The audience sits up. We believe her straightforwardness, and as a consequence are interested to see this young man for ourselves.Right on cue, Gerald Arbuthnot eagerly bursts in to inform the party that he has been made Lord Illingworth’s secretary. Lord Illingworth, we learn, is a powerful politician. This is exciting news for Gerald, affording him many prospects, as being Lord Illingworth’s secretary would potentially be his first step to a financially and politically successful life. Lady Hunstanton, unlike Lady Caroline, is pleased for Gerald and sends a letter through her footman inviting his mother to join their party at the estate. Mrs. Arbuthnot is highly regarded and has a great reputation in the community. The two young people, Gerald and Hester, leave the scene to go for a walk.Lady Hunstanton and Lady Stutfield have been prompted by events to discuss Lord Illingworth’s ambitions to be a foreign ambassador, and they go on to gossip and criticise his immorality towards women, when Lord Illingworth himself proceeds to enter the terrace. The ladies quickly switch their focus, thanking him for hiring Gerald Arbuthnot, but Lord Illingworth mysteriously says that he had had a personal interest in hiring the young man. We quickly deduce from his behaviour, that Lord Illingworth is unscrupulous and unprincipled. He is exceedingly flirtatious and cruel, using his power much in the way that Lady Caroline uses hers. He excels at witty bon mots, and is one of Oscar Wilde’s most watchable anti-heroes. There is an enjoyable lengthy scene between Lord Illingworth and a Mrs. Allonby, an equally quick-witted woman, who defies his overwhelming vanity. In his outrageous arrogance and flirtatiousness, Lord Illingworth claims he has such power over women, that he has never met a woman who could resist his advances. Mrs. Allonby therefore challenges him to make Hester Worsley, whom we have learned by now is eighteen and a Puritan, fall in love with him. The First Act ends with a letter being received from Mrs. Arbuthnot, to say that she will arrive at the party after dinner. Lord Illingworth sees the reply by letter from Mrs. Arbuthnot lying on the table, and clearly recognises the handwriting. Evidently appalled, his reaction prompts Mrs. Allonby to ask curiously who she is, whereupon he dismissively replies, “A woman of no importance.”The Second Act is set in the drawing room of the Hunstanton estate. Hester Worsley has been holding her own against the opinionated ladies in the party. They clearly find her honesty amusing and naïve, and according to their personalities, are either trying to be kind and direct her towards the accepted English way to behave in society, or maliciously mocking her. Hester is gradually disliking these ladies more and more, and becoming very contemptuous of their dissembling. The play is changing in tone, and we are aware that it is becoming far more serious. We are rapidly losing the wit of the drawing room comedy. When Gerald’s mother, Mrs. Arbuthnot, enters, we learn an extraordinary and unexpected fact. Gerald is the illegitimate child of Mrs. Arbuthnot and Lord Illingworth, who had once been known as George Harford. As George Harford, Lord Illingworth had refused to marry the woman carrying his child. He had offered to provide financial security for the baby (who of course is Gerald Arbuthnot) but Mrs. Arbuthnot despises him, for his refusal to marry her, and thereby forcing her to cope with the scandal of being a single mother.The scene becomes even more emotionally charged when Mrs. Arbuthnot begs him to leave her son alone, saying that Gerald is all she has, “George don’t take my son away from me. I have had twenty years of sorrow, and I have had only one thing to love me, only one thing to love. You have had a life of joy, and pleasure, and success.” Lord Illingworth callously refuses, saying that Gerald should be able to choose his own future. When Gerald enters, Lord Illingworth reiterates that he is immensely pleased with his choice, and that Gerald has the highest qualities that he had hoped for in a secretary. Mrs. Arbuthnot now begs her son not to take the advantageous position he has been offered, but refuses to reveal why. Gerald can see no reason to refuse this opportunity, and furthermore is very irritated with his mother’s seemingly inexplicable dislike of Lord Illingworth. Lord Illingworth pushes his advantage home, demanding that she explain to both of them, any possible reason she might have to protest against this golden opportunity for her son. Mrs. Arbuthnot is defeated. Unwilling to reveal that she is not a widow and incur the scandal that is bound to ensue when society learns that that her son is illegitimate, Mrs. Arbuthnot, greatly troubled, says that she has no other reason. The play has now become a savage indictment of the double standards of Victorian morality.Act Three takes place in the Hall at Hunstanton Chase. Lord Illingworth is victorious. We watch as he maliciously uses Gerald’s confiding in him to his own despicable advantage. Gerald evidently trusts his future employer, and seeks his advice about his mother. He says how much he admires her and wishes to protect her. He expresses to Lord Illingworth what a great woman she is, and wonders aloud why she has never told him of his father. Lord Illingworth uses this as an opportunity to promote his cynical views that even “great women” have limitations which inhibit the natural desires of young men. Lord Illingworth boastfully points out that he has never been married, and holds forth about society and morality, promising that he will introduce Gerald to new opportunities, and by implication a promiscuous and exciting new life. We see, through his depiction, that Victorian men were forgiven for their moral indiscretions, whereas society would thoroughly condemn women for similar actions, which would inevitable be judged and condemned as moral failings.When the other guests enter, Lord Illingworth capitalises on his success, entertaining them (and us) with his outrageous and shocking views on society. By now the audience loathes this man, yet in common with the company he is lecturing, we hold a secret admiration for his wit. Mrs. Arbuthnot says she would be sorry to hold such appalling views, and pointedly says that ruining a woman’s life is unforgivable.Gerald still clearly admires Lord Illingworth, and fully intends to go to India with him at the end of the month, despite his mother’s earlier pleas. Mrs. Arbuthnot, left alone with Hester, tries to rekindle the previous conversation about the position of women. It seems as though she is attempting to sound out Hester’s views. Indeed, Hester has very strong opinions about the double standards employed towards the men who unthinkingly impregnate women, and can then deny all knowledge, and the women who are then scorned and condemned by society. However, she does not believe that women are free of blame, roundly condemning both,“It is right that they should be punished, but don’t let them be the only ones to suffer. If a man and woman have sinned, let them both go forth into the desert to love or loathe each other there. Let them both be branded. Set a mark, if you wish, on each, but don’t punish the one and let the other go free. Don’t have one law for men and another for women.”Mrs. Arbuthnot has suffered yet another blow. Desperate by now, on Gerald’s return Mrs. Arbuthnot decides to tell her son the truth about his origin and her past life with Lord Illingworth, but does so obliquely, in the third person. She hopes to fully convey the despair of the women who are maligned and betrayed in this way. Gerald however, remains unmoved. Ironically, what seems to spur him into action is when Hester enters the room in great distress, exclaiming that Lord Illingworth tried to kiss her. Seeing Gerald in such a rage that he might attack Lord Illingworth, Mrs. Arbuthnot finally reveals the truth, that Lord Illingworth is his father. The scene ends inconclusively, with Gerald taking his mother home, and Hester leaving on her own.Act Four, the Final Act, has a very subdued feel. Gone is the bright sparkle of the play’s witty opening scene; gone is the drama of unfolding events. It takes place in the sitting room in Mrs. Arbuthnot’s house in Wrockley. Gerald is writing a letter to his father, Lord Illingworth, asking him to marry his mother. He has also decided to decline Lord Illingworth’s offer to become his secretary.Mrs. Arbuthnot is appalled at the idea of marrying a man she detests, saying that that she will not make a mockery of her life by marrying Lord Illingworth now.Hester having overheard their conversation, supports Mrs. Arbuthnot’s decision. Running to Mrs. Arbuthnot, she says she has realised,“I was wrong. God’s law is only Love.” She nobly offers to use her wealth to take care of Gerald, the man she loves and Mrs. Arbuthnot, as the mother she never had. When Lord Illingworth arrives, he magnanimously offers to marry Mrs. Arbuthnot and accept Gerald as his son. Mrs. Arbuthnot will not countenance his suggestion, telling him that she hates him and could never marry him. Lord Illingworth attempts to hit back, asserting that she had meant nothing to him, after which Mrs. Arbuthnot slaps him with his own glove. The neat closing moments show Mrs. Arbuthnot, now alone, calling for Gerald and Hester. She asks her future daughter-in-law to accept her as a mother. Gerald notices the glove on the floor, and not knowing of the tempestuous scene we have just witnessed, asks who has just visited.The final, perfectly apposite words spoken by Mrs. Arbuthnot to close the play, are, “No one in particular. A man of no importance.”A Woman of No Importance is a strange meld that does not quite work. It starts as a comedy of society: a social drawing room satire, with the familiar types of epigrams, such as,“The youth of America is their oldest tradition” and aphorisms such as,“Men marry because they are tired; women because they are curious. Both are disappointed”“Duty is what one expects from others, it is not what one does oneself”and paraprosdokians, such as,“It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about, nowadays, saying things against one behind one’s back that are absolutely and entirely true.” This deliciously wicked type of disingenuous writing is what we associate most with Oscar Wilde. Increasingly however, this play becomes more about the dark side of the Victorian era: a time of great moral hypocrisy where double standards were the norm. The “Poor Law” of the 19th century in Great Britain, included a “Bastardy Clause”, which made illegitimate children the sole responsibility of their mothers until they were 16 years old. If mothers of such children were unable to support themselves and their offspring, they would have to enter the workhouse. The fathers of such children had no responsibility in Law. The reasoning behind this, was the idea that this law would teach women to be more moral. Our modern sympathies are more inclined to rest with the abandoned women who have been left destitute. Yet the most appealing characters by far are those who embody this hypocrisy: Lord Illingworth and, to a lesser extent, Lady Caroline. It is they who provide our most enjoyable entertainment. Sadly, the characters in the play with whom we have most sympathy, who are upstanding, truthful and just, come across as boring and dull. Hester Worsley is one of the strongest characters in the play, and it is her voice which echoes Oscar Wilde’s own opinions and indictments against some of the attitudes of his day.“You love the beauty that you can see and touch and handle, the beauty that you can destroy, and do destroy, but of the unseen beauty of life, of the unseen beauty of a higher life, you know nothing. You lost life’s secret.”“You shut out from your society the gentle and the good. You laugh at the simple and the pure. living, as you all do, on other and by them, you need at self-sacrifice, and if you throw bread to the poor, it is merely to keep them quiet for a season.”“You are unjust to women in England. And till you count what is a a shame in a woman to be an infamy in a man, you will always be unjust, and Right, that pillar of fire, and Wrong, that pillar of cloud, will be made dim to your eyes, or be not seen at all, or if seen, not regarded.” Worthy she may be, passionate she certainly is, but neither she nor Mrs. Arbuthnot are at all appealing. Neither is Gerald Arbuthnot; he is merely weak. Even the drollery and waspishness of the minor characters is more enjoyable to watch than Hester’s droning moral monologues. In a play which is clearly intended to be persuasive, it is a mistake to make the immoral anti-hero quite so witty, intelligent and charming. Perhaps Oscar Wilde could not resist the temptation. But what this ends up as is a competition in dialogue between Lord Henry Wotton’s wit in “The Picture of Dorian Gray” and the earnest missionary zeal of Barbara Undershaft in George Bernard Shaw’s “Major Barbara”. Sadly it loses focus, and falls between the two.Interestingly Oscar Wilde reworked some of the dialogue from this one in his later plays. For instance, in one scene, Lord Illingworth and Mrs. Allonby share the line,“All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy.” “No man does. That is his.” The character of Algernon was to make the same remark in the incomparable “The Importance of Being Earnest”. Perhaps, after all, Oscar Wilde himself thought of this as a lesser play, and one which had not quite succeeded as he would have wished."

Oh, they did add to the play, to show how snobby they were but really the main characters, Miss Hestor Worsley, Mrs. Arbuthnot, Lord Illingworth and Gerald Arbuthnot are the play.Very enjoyable! Four stars!"
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48056505-piyangie,Rating 3 out of 5," A Woman of No Importance is yet another drawing-room play by Oscar Wilde, where he satirizes the morals, hypocritical conventions, and general views and conduct of Victorian upper-class society. Oscar Wilde was fiercely critical of the hypocrisy of the upper-class social norms and created some celebrated drawing-room plays to show the shallowness of the noble and rich. In this play, however, while keeping to his general social satire, Wilde has based his theme on social and legal injustice regarding dishonoured women and illegitimate children. It is quite shocking how the law and society of his day put the blame on women for their dishonour while overlooking the fact that a man's deception also has contributed towards the act. While the trusting woman was punished and suffered, the man who deceived and forsook her was pardoned and free. It is said that this social and legal position was upheld to deter women from committing sin, but one can see its falsity right through. It is the men creating laws and social rules for their protection and to the detriment of women. And this sensitive theme is what Oscar Wilde exposes through the story of Mrs. Arbuthnot, ""a woman of no importance"".The story was quite touching. And we can feel Wilde's sympathy for ""fallen women"". I greatly enjoyed how Wilde turned the tables to show that, after all, it is the notorious Lord Illingworth who is not the important one and not Mrs. Arbuthnot. However, the story, though very moving, had to be pulled out from the rest of the social commentary. The two went their separate ways although thinly connected by the characters. This lack of interconnection was felt strongly in the opening Acts, making them slow-moving. And the lackluster tone doesn't help either. The crucial turn at the end of the second Act got the story moving, yet the overall vibrancy, which is so characteristic of Wilde's drawing-room plays, was lacking here. There is enough wit and satire, of course, to keep the reader entertained. But the preachy undertone, which was quite uncharacteristic of him, was tedious. In most of his drawing-room plays, Wilde has maintained his characteristic exuberance even though the subject matter is grave. But in this play, it was to some extent replaced by a somber ambiance. Nevertheless, this is Oscar Wilde we are talking about, one of the wittiest playwrights of classical literature. So, one cannot find too many faults in a work of art by such a genius. All remarks here are made comparatively. And in this comparative light, A Woman of No Importance is perhaps the weakest drawing-room play by Oscar Wilde."

7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/86504940-william-gwynne,Rating 5 out of 5,"A Woman of No Importance is not Oscar Wilde's most renowned play, but it is potentially my favourite. This takes place in one location, in one dat at an upper-class dinner party. Oscar Wilde builds tension with the twists and turns, and explores the constraints of social behaviour in the 19th century with absolute genius to create humour and a feeling of high stakes by the end of the play."
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-dave-schaafsma,Rating 4 out of 5,"I needed a laugh so of course one of the people I turn to is Oscar Wilde, one of the wittiest writers ever, in the caustic social critic tradition of Moliere. But I also read one of Raymond Chandler’s witty and funny Phillip Marlowe novels, and I would love to be a fly on the wall during a conversation between Chandler and Wilde. Both masterful at the clever bon mot, the caustic aphoristic social observation. Our characters include Miss Hestor Worsley, Mrs. Arbuthnot, Lord Illingworth and Gerald Arbuthnot. Here’s some repartee for ya:.Lord Illingworth: The soul is born old but grows young. That is the comedy of life.Mrs. Allonby: And the body is born young and grows old. That is life's tragedy.“I don't know how to talk.”“Oh! talk to every woman as if you loved her, and to every man as if he bored you, and at the end of your first season you will have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact.”Lord Illingworth: What do you think she'd do if I kissed her?Mrs. Allonby: Either marry you, or strike you across the face with her glove. What would you do if she struck you across the face with her glove?Lord Illingworth: Fall in love with her, probably.“. . . an orchid there as beautiful as the seven deadly sins.” “One should always be in love. That is the reason one should never marry.”“Duty is what one expects from others, it is not what one does oneself.”“It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about, nowadays, saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.”“Men marry because they are tired; women because they are curious. Both are disappointed.”I am told that this earlier play of Wilde has historically been produced less than his later plays, and one reason for this may be that it is actually less fluffy than things like The Importance of Being Earnest (as delightful as that play is). As with Moliere, there is a kind of feminist turn in the play from a woman dismissed as one “of not importance” to conclude with the man who uttered that phrase about her, her ex, dismissed as “a man of no importance.” I liked it a lot."

Not much to say about the plot of this one, it’s Wilde, you know what you’re getting yourself into, but I am still amazed by how much I enjoy each of his writings. I wonder if he expected to be so successful so long after his tragic end."

It involves family drama, scandal, an arrogant jerk responsible for all the conflict in the play, etc. I enjoyed this play from beginning to end. As you may expect from Oscar Wilde, it was witty and cynical through and through.However, I do have one complaint: Some repetitions of quotes. For example, there was one that made fun of marriage, and I'm pretty there was a really similar (if not the same) to that one in another of the plays I read before this one. Maybe this would have not been easy to notice if I hadn't read so many of his plays in a row.Still, I enjoyed this immensely, especially the ending, which I will not spoil, but it made me feel so so so happy and grateful that karma exists.100% recommended.List of quotes:LADY STUTFIELD.

The man goes free.How could I swear to love the man I loathe, to honour him who wrought you dishonour, to obey him who, in his mastery, made me to sin?P.S.: Just as a side note, most of those quotes were said by Lord Illingworth, the cynic of the play, and the causer of mischievances."

I didn't warm up to any one of the characters, like I did to Tuppy in Lady W's Fan or Algy from The Importance of Being Earnest, the society crowd seemed even vainer and dumber than usual however, which made up for everything that was lacking.Even after a few days, I can't help but wonder what would have happened if Hester wasn't - quite conveniently - a very rich woman. This quote reminded me of our times of social media and cancel culture:""He must be quite respectable.

It's a satire on upper class English society, and of course the best thing about it is Wilde's brilliant wit.

Gee, that is incredibly inconvenient, but at least it is a road trip, and I am not too far from where I live, so I can sort of drive back, get the charger, and then continue on my trip (though it turned out to be further than I thought, so I just got a universal charger, which will come in handy back at university). Well, that does sort of depend on the amount of time that I have, but since I’m driving, and my brother really doesn’t care where we end up going, then that does turn out to be a good thing.	Anyway, this delightful little play is Wilde’s way of poking fun at the upper class of English society, but then again this is something that he seems to regularly do with his works. Actually, come to think of it, a lot of plays seem to be placed in the upper echelons of society, possibly because it allows us to get a glimpse into the rather scandal ridden, and ridiculous nature of the rather well healed.	The story is about a single mother, something that you really didn’t want to be back then. Actually, come to think of it, single mothers these days also get dumped on pretty heavily as well. In a way they are sort of slut shammed, namely because they happen to be left with the child after some rather dubious philanderer has their way with them and then disappears. However, in this story the father returns in an attempt to goad the child to come to India with him to work in the civil service.	Now, this is a pretty big thing, because getting into the Indian Civil Service was actually really, really hard. I remember going for a job in the civil service in Australia, for the Attorney General’s Department, and that was seriously one of the hardest interviews that I have ever been to. The amount of testing that they put you through is incredible. In a way that gives me an idea of what it was like to get into the Indian civil service in Victorian England – it was highly competitive, and only the best could hope to succeed.	The problem is that the poor woman is a single mother, which means that in part she is an outcast, and as the title of the play suggests, the father really doesn’t care about her. It is his son that he is interested in, and she can, well, go jump. In a way she is of no importance. That is the tragedy of the situation, in that the male, no matter how bad he is, still seems to get away with being a jerk while the woman is left to clean up the pieces. It reminds me of university where the male would have notches on his belt, while the woman would be slut shamed.	In a way nothing has changed – single mothers are ridiculed and considered to be a burden on society. In fact, the suggestion is that they actually go out and have kids simply so they can bludge off welfare. This is incredibly unfair, especially since the same people who slut shame them, also deny them abortions. In a way they expect them to remain pure while the guy, well, the guy can pretty much do what they want to do, and get away with it as well.	Of course, considering that this is a comedy, everything does eventually work out quite well. However, the beauty of this play is that Wilde is challenging the male attitude of treating women as conquests, and of being of no importance, while the male is considered to be a hero, and a sexual conqueror. No, the difference here is that Wilde makes us sympathise with the woman, while we turn our nose up at the male, who in the end we consider to be of no importance.	Oh, and before I forget, this is a prime example of Wilde’s skill with the English language. The way he puts this play together, and the way he drafts the lines, is nothing short of perfection. No wonder when I actually saw one of his plays performed I considered him to be nothing short of a modern day Shakespeare."
18,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45198798-leynes,Rating 4 out of 5,"A Woman of No ImportanceLORD ILLINGWORTH: It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about, nowadays, saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.""A Woman of No Importance"" is a play by Oscar Wilde which premiered on 19 April 1893 in London. It is one of Oscar's society plays which satirizes the English upper class society. The conversations are all about gossip and small talk, and most of the characters are shallow and viewless. At the beginning of the play Lady Caroline denounces Hester's enthusiasm for Gerald Arbuthnot until Gerald himself enters to proclaim that Lord Illingworth, a powerful, flirtatious male political figure, intends to employ him as his private secretary. Then Gerald is regarded as a good match after all. The ladies of the company constantly discuss rumours about Lord Illingworth – his aim for being a foreign ambassador, his social life and amoral qualities toward women. And as soon as he enters the room, the sole focus is on him. Everything he has to say opposes the norm and excites the company, the only one who remains undeceived by him is Mrs. Arbuthnot, who had been unfortunate enough to meet him in her youth. I was quite surprised to discover that this is quite the feminist play. Oscar tackles the issue of double standards in the Victorian Era and that men were forgiven for their indiscretions far more readily than women, and women were more condemned for moral failings. During a discussion of sinful women, Mrs. Arbuthnot contrasts Lady Hunstanton's later opinion by saying that ruining a woman's life is unforgivable. Furthermore, I really appreciated Hester's voice of reason in the play: 
HESTER: Don't have one law for men and another for women. [...] And till you count what is a shame in a woman to be infamy in a man, you will always be unjust.
It was also really uplifting to see that whilst in the beginning of the play Mrs. Arbuthnot was being referred to as a ""woman of no importance"", this was contrasted by her describing Lord Illingworth as a ""man of no importance"" by the end of the play, indicating that he has no longer power over her in any way and that she didn't give two shits about him whatsoever. Additionally, it's always nice to see women of the 19th century being strong enough to decline a marriage proposal and having the necessary confidence in their own capability to lead a happy life on their own. Surprisingly, in addition to the male dandy who is present in every society play by Oscar, there is a female dandy in ""A Woman of No Importance"" – Mrs. Allonby. She is a flirtatious woman who has a bit of a reputation for controversy. She is not the stereotypical female character and is equal to Lord Illingworth in her witticism and cynical statements. 
MRS. ALLONBY: The only advantage of playing with fire, Lady Caroline, is that one never gets singed. It is the people who don't know how to play with it who get burned up.
And probably my favorite scene in the entire play in which Hester and Mrs. Allonby discuss London dinner-parties: 
MRS. ALLONBY: I adore them. The clever people never listen, and the stupid people never talk.HESteR: I think the stupid people talk a great deal.MRS. ALLONBY: Ah, I never listen!
Another recurring theme is innocence. Innocence is presented in the character of Hester. She is an American girl who is foreign to the beliefs of the British aristocracy and their uptight morals and etiquette. Hester is often taken aback by their views and finds them far too materialistic and judgemental. However, the same can be said vice versa. The company sees Hester as naive and assumes that she has a hidden agenda in spreading her Puritan views. I was really surprised by the ending of the play, drawing from my experience of reading other plays by Oscar, I thought that the dandy would come out on the top, but instead we had a triumph of family and feminism. Oscar didn't shy away from destroying his dandy – Illingworth came to regret his mode of life and had to recognize that he was at fault whereas the Puritan and the Feminist (in the play) had something more valuable to say. The humour in ""A Woman of No Importance"" was much more subtle than in ""The Importance of Being Earnest"", but brilliant nonetheless. The fact that all characters had such annoying and exaggerated quirks, added a lot to my enjoyment of the satirical aspect of the play. For instance, Lady Caroline's blatant ignorance – she constantly and shamelessly refers to Mr. Kelvil as Mr. Kettle – or the fact that she is quite the overbearing wife and as soon as her husband is out of sight, quickly retrieves him and lectures him on everything. Another example for the satire in the play is Lady Studfield's stupid repetition of words on every occasion (""very, very interesting"", ""very, very wicked"" etc.) – it supports the fact that she is a woman who has no mind of her own and just goes along with the things the important people in the room are saying.Overall, I really enjoyed ""A Woman of No Importance"" and highly appreciated that it was a much more deeper and meaningful play . I applaud Oscar for his advocacy for gender equality."

Like all his plays Wilde is extremely and effectively critical of 19th century, however this play emphasises the distorted attitudes towards women.Wilde powerfully displays 19th century society's views towards women - how a man can be deceitful yet admired but a woman who is unmarried and unchaste is a woman of no importance. Lord Illingworth is pompous and self-indulged yet the other characters almost worship him. Where as Mrs. Arbuthnot has a son, Gerald, who was born out of wedlock and for this she is eschewed. However, without revealing the twist, Wilde shows how preconceived views can be wrong. It also criticises how 19th century viewed women as rebellious. Hester, a 'Puritan' American, expresses different views from English society about how women should act; for this she is deemed 'different'. The views she express are very liberal for the time which the other characters mock. For a current audience this is quite humourous and displays some dramatic irony as Hester's views almost align with society today.This play is definitely worth a read as it gives us an insightful view into the somewhat corrupt ideology of the 19th century. It might not mean to but this is a 'feminist' play which will not leave you disappointed."

27,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52500467-whatireallyread,Rating 4 out of 5,"Perhaps I shouldn't have started A Woman of No Importance immediately after finishing Lady Windermere's Fan. THE WRITINGIn this play again the comedy and drama are combined. There's plenty of social commentary and hypocrisy mocked. Wilde's famous wit again sparkles from every other line of the dialogue. This made reading the play very enjoyable. 
MRS. ALLONBY. They say, Lady Hunstanton, that when good Americans die they go to Paris. LADY HUNSTANTON. Indeed? And when bad Americans die, where do they go to? LORD ILLINGWORTH. Oh, they go to America.
However, I couldn't help but sometimes be pulled out of that enjoyment to think ""this is wit for the sake of wit"". Some dialogue felt unnecessary and disconnected from the story as if it was only included because it was something to say. Example: 
MRS. ALLONBY. What a thoroughly bad man you must be! LORD ILLINGWORTH. What do you call a bad man? MRS. ALLONBY. The sort of man who admires innocence. LORD ILLINGWORTH. And a bad woman? MRS. ALLONBY. Oh! the sort of woman a man never gets tired of. LORD ILLINGWORTH. You are severe - on yourself. MRS. ALLONBY. Define us as a sex. LORD ILLINGWORTH. Sphinxes without secrets.
Now, the conversation flowed there for a moment, wit and all. But that ""Define us as a sex"" was completely out of nowhere. I don't believe the character would have come up with that question at that moment. Wilde just wanted to insert somewhere that women are ""Sphinxes without secrets"", and it didn't really fit. The story doesn't really start until 40% mark of the play. It's all just an excuse for witty dialogue until that point. THE CHARACTERSLord Illingworth is the one who speaks almost exclusively through witticisms. This made him an amusing and interesting character. He's the devil-may-care cynic. And when we find out he's the anti-hero, it makes him even more complex. He's like a bouquet of flowers with a faint note of rot beneath the aroma of blooms. Hester is a young, beautiful, rather self-rightiously moralistic girl who eventually learns the world isn't black-and-white. She reminded me of Lady Windermere that way. But with little stage-time, we didn't get to know Hester well, so it was difficult to care for her particularly.Gerald is a young man, quite generic for his time. He follows everyone around like a puppy, seeks approval and is eager to imitate and please. He has no agency. When he is outraged and tries to influence the sequence of events, it is with generic outrage, perfunctory words, and actions born entirely of expectations of others. He's quickly subdued, though, so it doesn't matter much.Mrs. Arbuthnot, the martyr. At first, she comes across as a kind, sensible, good woman, noble even. This is conveyed to us through the opinions of others and through descriptions of her past actions. But when she enters the stage and we get to experience her character firsthand, to me she seemed vindictive, manipulative, selfish and petty. She hysterically clings to her adult son, gives self-righteous speeches, spews spite and blatantly admits she fully intends to be miserable her whole life just to put it in everyone's face. THE ENDING***spoilers ahead, duh***I wonder if Wilde meant the ending to be satirical or not. If not, it didn't really fit the story for me. The devil-may-care cynic Illingworth suddenly, immediately, for no reason, against every character trait we saw in the whole play before, becomes attached to his bastard son. Even more surprisingly, he's willing to act against his beliefs and desires (which for the whole play he swore up and down he would never do), to bind himself to someone he didn't want to know (and he didn't even want to be bound to the people he liked), in order to get to talk to that bastard son. An absolutely unremarkable young man. One in whom Illingworth had absolutely no interest for 20 years. WHY? It just didn't at all fit the character. I didn't believe it.The martyred Mrs. Arbuthnot triumphed, sort of? Was that the point of the ending? She found out Gerald wanted to make his father marry his mother. (LOL boy how? no one succeded in this 20 years ago, and now you decide to try with absolutely no ways to achieve this?) Mrs. Arbuthnot proceeds to refuse so adamantly as if a proposal was indeed made her. Illingworth grudgingly, barely and unbelievably almost agreed later. It's not like he actually wanted to marry, it's not like he even proposed. But she revels in her venomous speech so much, it really ruined any hope of her being a strong female character.I wish the ending allowed more complexity to Illingworth if he had to make a change of heart and wish for a relationship with his son. Why is he allowed no chance at redemption? And I wish Mrs. Arbuthnot had the chance to actually behave nobly and composedly instead of that disgraceful scene. There was such potential here for a strong female character. If Illingworth genuinely wanted to marry her and Mrs. Arbuthnot calmly and firmly refused, it would have been a powerful scene and a strong woman. Kind of like Eugene Onegin, come to think of it. The ending of Lady Windermere's Fan was much better in terms of character complexity, I think."

The only difference between the saint and the sinner is that every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future.
Gerard: I want to go with Lord Illingworth, but I cannot abandon my mother.Mrs. Arbuthnot: You are all mine, son.Lord Illingworth: You can’t have him all for yourself, not anymore.The only sin of Mrs. Arbuthnot catches up with her 20 years after she commits it. She has to give up her son to the one who destroyed her life by disgracing her. She has to let her only son embrace his father, whom Gerald thought was dead. Mrs. Arbuthnot has only one way to save her son and that is by telling him the truth no matter how hard it is. “A Woman of no Importance” is an enjoyable read. I loved the way dichotomies are distorted. Saints are rejected while sinners are accepted with open arms. Disgraceful practices linger by and no one seems to pay attention to them. They are even encouraged. Dialogues contain what people think more than what they actually say, things that one is not supposed to say. Dialogues reveal what women would rather not tell and be, and men are portrayed as how they are loved because of their flaws and despised because of their intellect. Mrs. Arbuthnot is a saint even though she is sinful. Her sin belongs to the past and even if it always there, as her son, she is a saint because “the only difference between the saint and the sinner is that every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future.” She tries to repent by dedicating her life to her son. She gives up everything for him, even her name. Her name caught my attention as being “are but not.” She becomes a nameless creature because of a wicked man, an“Ill personage” whose actions only bring misery. His worth is limited to his position and not to his virtues, as he has none. Lord Illingworth never changes. He tries to seduce and disgrace every woman whom he develops an interest but when he realizes that he has a son, something awakens in him. Regret. His only regret is that because of his actions, he cannot get to love and keep his son as his legitimate child. But even that regret fades quickly."

More marriages are ruined nowadays by the common sense of the husband than by anything else.  How can a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating her as if she were a perfectly rational being?”This was a great insight indeed though I thought I knew it. “The Ideal Man!  Oh, the Ideal Man should talk to us as if we were goddesses, and treat us as if we were children.  He should refuse all our serious requests, and gratify every one of our whims.  He should encourage us to have caprices, and forbid us to have missions.  He should always say much more than he means, and always mean much more than he says.” Now I know ... “ When one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself.  And one ends by deceiving others.  That is what the world calls a romance. “I mean .. these were really interesting quotes One more “The secret of life is to appreciate the pleasure of being terribly, terribly deceived.”This gave me a very good introduction to Wilde’s world - the story of the play itself is brief but throws up a number of moral and social obligations of men and women that you would prefer to find out reading for yourself.

The BBC Radio drama stars Diana Rigg as Mrs Arbuthnot, Martin Jarvis as Lord Illingworth, Annette Crosbie as Lady Hunstanton and Sir Michael Hordern as Sir Charles Crawford. As might be expected with this cast, it was a treat to listen to these actors. I did regret a few of the cuts that the adaptor made but they were all well chosen in the sense of not disrupting the flow of the talk.

What is of importance is Wilde's dialogue which is as relentlessly witty and snarky as anything you will ever find. Nearly every page of this wonderfully fun play brings a new aphorism or insult into my growing catalogue. We all have that one friend that brings every single room into constant laughter every single time they're in one. They defy reality in their ability to so consistently bring joy to others. Spending time reading Oscar Wilde is like being around one of those friends.

For it being simple yet stunning. Several times while reading I felt lik Wilde understood men better but this one proves that he understood women well too. In this play, His stance was to support women and give them as equal place and as equal dignity along with the respect they deserve.For me its my most favorite of Wilde's works coz its witty, satirical, obstentious and yet hilarious and heart touching in many ways. Its a jewel of dramas.Few quotes :In temple everyone should be serious except the thing that is worshipped.The soul is born but grows young. That is the comedy of life. And the body is born young and grows old that is life's tragedy.The book of life begins with a man and woman in the garden. It ends with Revelations.When a man is old enough to do wrong, he should be old enough to do right alsoNo man has real success in this world unless he has got a woman to back him and women rule society.Men marry because they are tired, women because they are curious. Both are disappointed.The only difference between the saint and the sinner is that every saint has a past and every sinner has a future.Last but not the leastWe men know life too earlyAnd we women too late."

48,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45916452-emma-l,Rating 3 out of 5," *** This review containts spoilers ***Rating: 🌟🌟🌟 (3/5 stars). Ever since I did that Oscar Wilde course I have wanted to read more of his plays, since they are basically super dramatic, short, and fun to read. For some reason, I had a grand plan of reading multiple plays this summer (Macbeth, A Woman of No Importance, A Midsummer Night´s Dreams, and Twelfth Night), but I actually only ended up reading A Woman of No Importance, whoops. But since I have nothing else to say, here are some of my thoughts on the play:  This was a fun and fast-paced play. I really love how all of Oscar Wilde's plays are super dramatic and have the weirdest characters ever. Last year I did a class on Oscar Wilde and during the performance week, two amazing ladies performed a skit/scene from this play, and ever since that day I've wanted to read this play. So in my mind summer was the best timing for reading plays, somehow. So I indeed read this summer. I love how the son first was like OH NO THAT WOMAN IS SHREWD REALLY BAD, SHE HAD A CHILD OUT OF WEDLOCK. But when it was revealed that his own mother was that woman from the story he was like THAT MAN WHO FATHERED ME IS WICKED, YOU'RE AN ANGEL MUM. I still really think that's funny😂😂😂I also love how Rachel refused to marry the man who knocked her up in a time when that was super scandalous by fakingly announcing he would marry her the first time. LIKE YOU GO RACHEL, REFUSE THAT TRASH CAN! I also loved how Hester, the little puritan, was like you made the right choice and even scorned her beau Gerald (who is also Rachel's son) forever suggesting that Rachel should marry that man. That's truly what I would call feminism and I love how Wilde incorporated that in this play. It is quite modernistic in that way. I don't really have anything else to say about this except that it was fun to read but that it is ultimately not my favorite play by him. The importance of being earnest will always be my favorite since that's truly over the top dramatic and hilarious. Furthermore, I also think that I prefer lady Windemere's fan over this one since I was more surprised and engaged by that plotline. I also wasn't shocked by the plot twist since I already knew what was going to happen so the big parental reveal wasn't something that had me shooketh. Overall not much happens but it truly shows how fond Wilde is of talking about his weird beliefs which I will always love. That man was sure dramatic and unique and such an icon."

Men marry because they are tired; women because they are curious. Both are disappointed.

To get into the best society, nowadays, one has either to feed people, amuse people, or shock people. That is all.

When one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself and one ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls a romance.
This is one of those typical Oscar Wilde plays, filled with aphorisms in the form of conversations. The story begins with the entire bunch of play's characters gathering together in Lady Hunstanton's garden and the conversations that follow. I have always loved Oscar Wilde's plays its rich prose and the ideas that Wilde expresses in a rather satirical way, through his characters. Every character is interesting. Especially Lord Illingworth and Mrs Allonby.Set in 1890s, Wilde has attacked the self-righteousness and hypocrisy of upper-class society and how they treat women in the society, in his usual cynical manner. The storyline is basic, however being an Oscar Wilde play, the rich prose and witticisms surely make it worth reading. Would definitely recommend this one to Oscar Wilde fans!"

There's a lot of fun dialogue which is... well... fun... but as far as plot goes, it doesn't really kick in until sometime later. Which, when it shows up, actually feels a bit disjointed.Then the plot itself is one that he seems to have written frequently. It was apparently a schtick of his. It gets stale after a while.But there are still wonderful quotable moments, which is the real reason any of us even read Wilde, right?""Nothing should be out of the reach of hope. Life is hope.""""The one advantage of playing with fire, Lady Caroline, is that one never gets even singed. It is the people who don't know how to play with it who get burned up.""""I don't think that we should ever be spoken of as other people's property. All men are married women's property. That is the only true definition of what married women's property really is. But we don't belong to any one.""""Men always want to be a woman's first love. That is their clumsy vanity. We women have a more subtle instinct about things. What we like is to be a man's last romance.""Anyway, good stuff, but not Wilde's best. I'm actually beginning to wish Wilde had written about something other than relationships between men and women in society. That's what he is truly known for, but such rapid back-to-back readings of his writing make me wonder if he wasn't just a one-trick-pony. A brilliant one-trick-pony. But."

The play is everything Wilde's plays are - sarcastic, caustic, cynical, amusing, and wholly entertaining.The play transpires over two days and deals with the theme of 'a fallen woman'. Wilde in his characteristic style pokes fun at British upper class society and gender norms. The play, as can be found in all of Wilde's plays, is littered with witty comments critiquing society. Surprisingly, the dandies in this play are mostly female. I liked the way Wilde dealt with gender dynamics in this play; wittily pitting ladies and gentlemen against each other, thereby showing the hypocrisy of both. And yet what finally shines through the story are the values of Love and Sacrifice. Wilde was way ahead of his times. His stance on gender equality may fail to find ground even in the 21st century in all countries. And I loved how poetic the ending was - 'A Man of No Importance'."

Además, aunque sean un poco estupidos, hay intercambios bastante largos en los que solo hablan mujeres (y no solo sobre hombres). Hay momentos en los que dudé si Wilde conocía algo parecido a la sororidad, pero pero pero, al final demostró que si.Por otro lado, también se plantearon ideas un poco raras en cuanto a religión. Como los castigos que hombres y mujeres deberían tener (por cosas que no podriamos considerar hoy en dia como pecados) y aún peor, que los hijos de estos deberían ""heredar"" el castigo, porque ""esa es la ley de Dios"" PERO también esa idea se da vuelta:""Estaba yo equivocada. La única ley de Dios es el amor"".

I had no idea what this play was going to be about and didn't have any expectations, but I was still really surprised by it. The first act was very classic Oscar Wilde and I expected the play to be a regular comedy of manners. While this play definitely has the expected witticisms and is a comedy of sorts, it was much more serious and almost bitter when compared to his other plays.Oscar Wilde's plays always have social criticism but the condemnation of how society treats women felt much more scathing than criticisms in other stuff by him that I've read. That's not a bad thing, but it was surprising. At times I forgot how old this play was because of how modern some of the ideas were. Nothing ground breaking, of course, but this play was written over a hundred years ago, less than 10 years after women were allowed to own property. In context, it was unexpected.This play doesn't come close to beating The Importance of Being Earnest as my favorite play, but I'm not sure if anything can. I really recommend this to anyone that enjoys plays or Oscar Wilde."

And that, consequently, whatever the world has treated seriously belongs to the comedy side of things."" In this play, Oscar Wilde explores the double standards that exist between men and women in the Victorian era. Men were forgiven for their indiscretions far more readily than women. Women were more condemned for moral fallings, had fewer rights than men and weren't treated equally. The play also emphasizes morality and the conflict between a person's own private sense of morality and the moral values imposed on us by the society. The plot is very simple but it is the physiological interactions between the characters that reveal a darker side to the society and the Victorian era. Oscar Wilde is a brilliant and remarkable author. His narratives are really compelling and his characters are really original. I found myself acting the play out in my head, such is the power and force of Wilde's dialogues. Loved this play and all of his other works. Highly recommended."

And at every turn,there is a sharp arrow directed at the society of that period. You can't read Wilde without a half-smile on your lips,it's half because you'd be wondering whether you should smile at those creative insults too.. It was a friend of mine who told me that swearing is an art.. He was so creative in that art that it used to take me more than an hour to understand some of his masterpieces..

77,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20065569-jim-dooley,Rating 3 out of 5,"There is a deception that is part of the fun of reading Oscar Wilde. This work is a four Act play and, for the most part, reads like a typical drawing room piece. Today’s audiences would have great difficulty in watching people seated and chatting, even if witticisms are being bandied about. After a while, all of the one-upmanships begin to grow stale. Then, there is the amoral reprobate who seems to be a featured player in so many of Wilde’s works. This is the pattern for the first two Acts. I was trying to decide whether or not to do a review or just let this one go. Things change and become much more intriguing in Acts Three and Four. Wilde had fun poking holes into the mores and morals of society. He was an expert at making them look nonsensical and fit only for derision (which he applied in healthy doses). In this one, though, lessons are learned and emotions take a heartfelt turn. It is weaker Wilde and not great drama by any means. However, it is still worthwhile ... and it is especially enjoyable to see that twist on the play’s title at the conclusion."

His feminist nature and views on the world are appreciated, especially coming from that time period. This story was very sad. Lord Illingworth turns out in the end to be an even bigger jerk than he initially seems. I really feel Mrs. Arbuthnot's pain come through. I also liked Hester Worsley – the American, and how she comes around at the end. Excellent, with just the right touch of comedy (but I do not view this play as a comedy at all). Of course, as in Lady Windermere's Fan, Wilde keeps interrupting the plot with his long, witty banter about men and women. It's amusing, but sometimes frustrating. A very good story! Great dialogue and amazing characters and portrayal of human nature (both good and bad). "

Comienza con un grupo de aristócratas está reunido en una casa hablando distendidamente entre ellos, hombres y mujeres; y charlando precisamente de la sociedad. Este acto y el segundo son los que Wilde utiliza para lanzar pullas constantes contra la aristocracia británica, su clasismo, machismo e incluso ignorancia. A partir de ahí la trama se focaliza en tres de los personajes y la historia avanza en una dirección que nada tiene que ver pero que mantiene ese trasfondo de machismo y que finaliza, como diríamos, con un buen guantazo en la boca. ¡Chapeau por ese final Mr. Wilde!, un acierto para la época."

A wonderful play by Wilde that did not disappoint.I was surprised at how feminist it seemed, especially the speeches by Hester and Mrs. Arbuthnot. I was not expecting this to be the case, as it was written in the 1800's by a man, but it was fascinating to read. the contrast between the strict Victorian morality (mostly shown as hypocritical, but nonetheless) and the cynicism of dandy aestheticisem was also very well written.Something I noticed and find interesting about Wilde's work is that, although he was a huge part of the dandy movement and the ""Art for art's sake"" philosophy, all of his dandy characters seem to be portrayed as the ""villains"" of his work (Lord Henry, Lord Illingworth in this, etc,). The only exception I can think of is Algernon from Earnest. actually, I find many similarities between Lord Henry and Lord Illingworth. Most notably the lack of a moral center, love of youth, and the line ""all influence is bad influence."" I think we can be thankful that ((SPOILER)) Gerard decided in the end not to go with Illingworth, or he might have gone down a similar path to Dorian Gray.((SPOILER))"

The discussions on how society treats men vs. how it treats women were captivating but the characters and story line were not. They felt largely flat and uninteresting with little development. A special mention goes out to the role female characters played in questioning the way things work, satirizing expectations of women, and subverting tropes. I would read it for the commentary, not the plot.Since this is Oscar Wilde, can't end without sharing some of his cleverest lines:“It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about, nowadays, saying things against one behind one’s back that are absolutely and entirely true.” “To get into the best society, nowadays, one has either to feed people, amuse people, or shock people - that is all!”“We in the House of Lords are never in touch with public opinion.

Somehow it became a literary rite of passage for young women to don lipstick and kiss the resting place of the famous playwright. At the time I thought it odd: why would women pay homage to a gay writer in this way? After finishing A Woman of No Importance, I can understand where these adulators are coming from. This play espouses feminist principles and its central theme is equality of the sexes in high society. Moreover, there are numerous female characters all with very different personalities.It is true that A Woman of No Importance isn't as funny as some of Wilde's other plays. While it naturally is rich with Wilde's famous witticisms, the repartee doesn't sparkle like it does in The Importance of Being Earnest. Wilde's target is -- as always -- the hypocrisy of the upper classes, and characters like Mrs. Allonby and Lord Illingworth serve as excellent vehicles for the upper class's incorrigible wickedness.In all, I would say well worth the read for any feminist or Wilde fan. If it is ever performed in my area, I will certainly jump at the chance to go see it.Words BelowVocabulary helpmeet. (n) A helpful companion or partner, especially one's husband or wife.

Yes, there are some witty lines and entertaining characters, but as someone already mentioned, you will find many recycled Wildean epigrams here, which are slightly altered.The first pages of the book are strong, the most engaging characters are side characters, I foundLady Caroline charming and utterly amusing, but she was just there as a comic relief. The core story is utterly corny, cliché, and contrived; the characters, especially the main ones, are mere caricatures, Gerald and his mothers are devoid of almost any redeeming features, their lines were cringeworthy. The plot and development of A Woman of Importance reminds me of those cheesy, sub-par Latin American telenovelas, which I hate with passion. This play is more suited as the basis of a ‘telenovela’, rather than for serious theatre. I am extremely disappointed."

A firmly plotted satirical drama designed as a social commentary and full of absolutely stunningly witty lines.""All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy."" ""No man does. That is his.""If I've learnt one thing from this play I think it can suffice to say that I should never go to Oscar Wilde for 'pick-up lines.' For much of the clever banter in his play could prove offensive if taken in the wrong context. And the advice of trying to kiss a puritan lady and then falling in love with her if she slaps you with a glove doesn't bode well for today's company. This is humour how I like it. Quick retorts and words that have been moulded and played with. You can almost sense how Wilde delights in playing with the words of his characters, making them dance for your - and for his - amusement. Like Lady Windermere's Fan there is much that Wilde comments about in society. However he does it all with his tongue firmly in his cheek. I have to wonder if he was playing his own practical joke upon his society with each new play he penned.In the end this is a play that can be read as easily as it can be imagined on a stage. That is the power of Wilde's charming wit and ability with words. So I encourage that you read this if you have not attempted any of Wilde's fanciful plays as of today."

Her life was ruined, and her soul ruined, and all that was sweet, and good and pure in her ruined also. She suffered terribly- she suffers now. She will always suffer. For her there is no joy, no peace, no atonement. She is a woman who drags a chain like a guilty thing. She is a woman who wears a mask like a thing that is a leper. The fire cannot purify her. The waters cannot quench her anguish. Nothing can heal her! No anybody can give her sleep. No poppies forgetfulness. She is lost. She is a lost soul.What atonement can be made to me? There is no atonement possible. I'm disgraced. He is not. That is all. It is the usual history of a man and a woman as it usually happens, as it always happens. And the ending is the ordinary ending.

The informed reviewer would probably remark at the sophistication of the jibes, but to me, they felt like an inside joke. There was also a lot of social commentary that I really enjoyed in the play such as the role of women and that of the upper classes. Well worth a read again for Wilde's talented writing"

133,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/105659692-thomas,Rating 4 out of 5,"The plot is rather trite and the moral characters are too prominent and utterly dull. Given Wilde's genius that is probably intentional and a commentary on the banality of life. Fortunately, our beloved author took pity on his audience and gave us the character of Lord Illingworth, whose sardonic witticisms brought joy into my world. Thrice I burst into hearty laughter, only to realize that I was in a public (outdoor) space and likely thought mad by my fellow humans.QuotesAs for a title, a title is really rather a nuisance in these democratic days. As George Harford I had everything I wanted. Now I have merely everything that other people want, which isn’t nearly sopleasant.The youth of America is their oldest tradition. It is been going on now for 300 yearsI adore simple pleasures, they are the last refuge of the complexLORD ILLINGWORTH: I don’t intend to grow perfect at all. At least, I hope I shan’t. It would be most inconvenient. Women love us for our defects. If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything, even our gigantic intellects.LORD I: People’s mothers always bore me to death. All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy.MRS. ALLONBY. No man does. That is his.LORD I: To be in it (society) is merely a bore. But to be out of it simply a tragedy. Society is a necessary thing. No man has any real success in this world unless he has got women to back him, and women rule society. If you have not got women on your side you are quite over. Youmight just as well be a barrister, or a stockbroker, or a journalist at once.GERALD: It is very difficult to understand women, is it not?LORD I: You should never try to understand them. Women are pictures. Men are problems. If you want to know what a woman really means—which, by the way, is always a dangerous thing to do—look at her, don’t listen to her.LORD I: There is nothing like youth. The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life. The old are in life’s lumber-room. But youth is the Lord of Life. Youth has a kingdom waiting for it. Every one is born a king, and most people die in exile, like most kings. To win back my youth, Gerald, there is nothing I wouldn’t do—except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member ofthe community.LADY S: Yes, there are moments, certainly. But was it something very, very wrong that Mr. Allonby did? Did he become angry with you, and say anything that was unkind or true?MRS. ALLONBY. Oh dear, no. Ernest is invariably calm. That is one of the reasons he always gets on my nerves. Nothing is so aggravating as calmness ...LADY S: ... I would so much like to know what was the wrong thing Mr. Allonby did.MRS. A: Well, I will tell you, if you solemnly promise to tell everybody else.LADY S: Thank you, thank you. I will make a point of repeating it.MRS. A: When Ernest and I were engaged, he swore to me positively on his knees that he had never loved any one before in the whole course of his life. I was very young at the time, so I didn’t believe him, I needn’t tell you. Unfortunately, however, I made no enquiries of anykind till after I had been actually married four or five months. I found out then that what he had told me was perfectly true. And that sort of thing makes a man so absolutely uninteresting.MRS. A: Men always want to be a woman’s first love. That is their clumsy vanity. We women have a more subtle instinct about things. What we like is to be a man’s last romance.endMRS. A: Lord Illingworth, there is one thing I shall always like you for.LORD I: Only one thing? And I have so many bad qualities.MRS. A: Ah, don’t be too conceited about them. You may lose them as you grow old.LORD I: I never intend to grow old. The soul is born old but grows young. That is the comedy of life.MRS. A: And the body is born young and grows old. That is life’s tragedy.LORD I: Silliest word (health) in our language, and one knows so well the popular idea of health.

Esta obra se desarrolla en la mansión de Lady Hunstanton, una figura de la alta sociedad en torno a los secretos y las relaciones ocultas de los personajes que la visitan. Entre ellos se encuentra Gerald Arbuthnot, un joven idealista en busca de una oportunidad, y Mrs. Arbuthnot, su madre, quien guarda un oscuro secreto que amenaza con arruinar su reputación. Wilde utiliza el humor y la ironía de una manera magistral para desenmascarar la hipocresía y las convenciones sociales de la época. A través de los diálogos, el autor pone al descubierto las contradicciones morales de la alta sociedad y critica las restricciones impuestas a las mujeres, resaltando la doble moral y los estándares de la época. Un ejemplo de esto es Mrs. Arbuthnot, presentada como una mujer que ha sido juzgada y condenada por la sociedad debido a un error en su juventud. A pesar de su arrepentimiento y su intento de construir una nueva vida, se enfrenta a un trato injusto y a la desaprobación constante debido a su pasado. Este personaje es utilizado para cuestionar la doble moral de la sociedad, que condena a las mujeres por sus errores mientras tolera o incluso celebra comportamientos similares en los hombres.Además de Mrs. Arbuthnot, Wilde también introduce a otras mujeres en la obra que desafían los roles tradicionales de género y muestran una cierta independencia y fuerza. Por ejemplo, Hester Worsley, ella es una mujer audaz con carácter rebelde y espíritu independiente.Asimismo a través de estos personajes femeninos, Wilde plantea preguntas sobre la autonomía de las mujeres, su capacidad para tomar decisiones propias y su derecho a la redención y al perdón. Si bien la obra no presenta una perspectiva feminista explícita, los personajes femeninos desafían los estereotipos tradicionales y ofrecen una visión más compleja y empoderada de las mujeres en la sociedad.Además, ""Una mujer sin importancia"" fue dedicada a la madre del autor, Jane Frances Elgee. Esta dedicatoria añade un significado adicional a la obra, ya que muestra la conexión personal de Wilde con la trama de la historia. Aunque es importante tener en cuenta que la crítica se manifiesta de manera sutil y a menudo a través de diálogos ingeniosos y subtextos. Sin embargo, pienso que al dedicar la obra a su madre, Wilde reconoce y valora la importancia de las mujeres en su vida. Especialmente por el último diálogo de la obra, que no pienso mencionar para no arruinar el interés del lector."
135,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62404723-fred,Rating 4 out of 5,"A wonderfully written and immensely enjoyable/hilarious play that lived up to all my expectations. Oscar Wilde is just one of those authors I can completely slip into at any time; he is the sole reason why I now love reading plays a lot more than I previously did. A Woman of No Importance is no exception.This play has a remarkably different moral compass than many of Oscar’s other plays: whilst pretty much all the characters are ridiculous, there are some characters who are not quite as ridiculous as the others. Surprisingly, it is these characters who actually prevail at the end and that gives the play much more of a poignant note. This play is all about eradicating toxic relationships, making amendments for the past, learning that the past doesn’t haunt you and follow you forever, and, above all, the fact that women and men should not be treated in any way differently! Neither is more superior than the other. (Unlike An Ideal Husband, which goes through phases of being very pro-male and then other phases of being very pro-female. That is, however, for comedy value, rather than being part of the genuine overall message.)A Woman of No Importance follows the young Gerald who has just been accepted as the secretary of the enormously popular ladies’ man Lord Illingworth. One of the few people who does NOT swoon before him is Mrs. Arbuthnot, Gerald’s mother, who Lord I. describes as ‘a woman of no importance’. As secrets are revealed, Gerald has to face a difficult moral quandary with regard to his family and his lover, Hester.  An extremely worthwhile play that I probably need to read again! Although Oscar Wilde’s writing is quite easy to read, the plots themselves can actually be quite dense and full of extra themes, hence why reading it again is something I would definitely like to do to get even more out of it."

You have recycled your characters from your other works, and you have copied almost exact dialogues. Example 1:The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890): ""They say that when good Americans die they go to Paris,"" chuckled Sir Thomas, who had a large wardrobe of Humour's cast-off clothes. ""Really! And where do bad Americans go to when they die?"" inquired the duchess. ""They go to America,"" murmured Lord Henry.A Woman of No Importance (1893): MRS ALLONBY. They say, Lady Hunstanton, that when good Americans die they go to Paris. LADY HUNSTANTON. Indeed? And when bad Americans die, where do they go to? LORD ILLINGWORTH. Oh, they go to America.Example 2:The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890): ""Never marry at all, Dorian. Men marry because they are tired; women, because they are curious: both are disappointed.""A Woman of No Importance (1893): LORD ILLINGWORTH. Men marry because they are tired; women because they are curious. Both are disappointed.Are you serious? So sleazy and lazy of you. And this is only 2 examples. The whole play is full of this, I could go on forever. Also the play is the same social commentary that we have all heard from you before. You are not a one trick pony, are you?I have not read all of your works but I have read a fair amount, heck I even have read Dorian Gray eight times. Did you really think that I would not notice? I am disappointed to be frank, but on the bright side, I still enjoyed the play and found the last scene and ending to be powerful. Anyway, next time I am in Paris, I am gonna come to see you in the XXe arrondissement and we are gonna have a chat about this. Cordialement, M. "
137,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29272226-jean-cole,Rating 4 out of 5,"Not for me to critique the classics, so I won't try.The edition in which this play appeared also included 4 other works by Mr. Wilde, including Lady Windermere's Fan, which I read before I read A Woman of No Importance and The Importance of Being Earnest, which I will read before I return this volume to the library.These plays are a fascinating (satirical and humorous) glimpse of society at the turn of the century, when the titled lords and ladies of England were scrambling to maintain their ""natural dominance"" over the middle and lower classes. I learned that the middle class was the most disturbing, as they had the temerity to work and earn money on their own as opposed to inheriting it. Then there are those pesky wealthy merchant Americans who were marrying their most eligible men and introducing all sorts of uncomfortable notions like equality for all. See, for instance, the conversation between Lady Caroline and her American visitor, Hestor Worsley:LC -- ""In my young days, Miss Worsley, one never met anyone in society who worked for their living. It was not considered the thing.""HW -- ""In America those are the people we admire the most.""LC -- ""I have no doubt of it.""The long-standing inequality of social consequences when an unmarried woman bears a child is really the focus of this particular play. Interesting to see that this issue was being addressed publicly (not without shock and horror on the part of some, no doubt) in 1893 and yet some of the same beliefs still resonate today."
138,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75581566-marine,Rating 3 out of 5,"""A Woman of No Importance effectively argues against all sexual laws and restrictions, showing them to be both ineffectual against the power of passion and impulse, and a potent weapon in the hands of those who choose to exploit them. Mrs. Arbuthnot struggles with an absolute morality that denies all her true instincts as a woman, finding in the melodramatic role of injured innocent both a relief from her own guilt and a means of retaining possession of her son.... Wilde’s sympathies do not obviously lie with either sex. The subtle and intricate pattern of power he reveals simply reflects the hypocrisy and manipulation that result from the imposition of any law upon human behavior.... The true centre of A Woman of No Importance is this interaction between human nature and the laws which seek to confine it.""(Eltis, Sos. Revising Wilde : Society and Subversion in the Works of Oscar Wilde. Oxford : Clarendon P, 1996)This review makes me think about The Portrait of Dorian Gray and the ways Dorian's behaviour can't be fixed by society's rules, even the ones made by Victorian society - such as how to be well-behaved in the aristocratic society. Having recently read American Psycho, another example of someone who should present good behaviours because of his social position in society, you start to wonder about the effectiveness of rules in society and the truth behind human nature. Is human truly that bad and can rules truly fix them, or is it the rules that push humans to break them and therefore develop bad behaviours? ~in my philosophy era"

I'd happily read a full-length novel about these characters being frivolous and very, very quotable. I have never really harboured acting aspirations, but it's a testament to Wilde's talent that reading his work often makes me wonder what'd be like to put on a production, deliver witty one-liners, and simply relish the effortless flow of dialogue that makes every Oscar Wilde play a work of beauty and genius. The world has always laughed at its own tragedies, that being the only way in which it has been able to bear them.Oscar Wilde uses the plot of A Woman of No Importance to comment on many things including class divide and the upper society's hypocritical attitudes towards gender expectations and dynamics."

I don't usually write goodreads reviews but 'A Woman of No Importance' really touched me so I feel like I must write something. The play started off as hilarious, (I couldn't prevent myself from laughing out loud) but it took a really serious turn towards the middle/end. The social commentary, as is usually the case with Oscar Wilde, was brilliant and the ending was extremely powerful. Here is one quote that I felt was particularly stirring:""I will not. You talk of atonement for a wrong done. What atonement can be made to me? There is no atonement possible. I am disgraced; he is not. That is all. It is the usual history of a man and a woman as it usually happens, as it always happens. And the ending is the ordinary ending. The woman suffers.

Again Wilde tackles the subject of gender equality, this time through the conceit of a reunited pair of former lovers and an unbeknownst son. It's actually rather ridiculous that Victorian society treated jilted women in such a way, but interesting that Wilde gave his character a believable success story and an ultimate revenge on the man who mistreated her! I wonder if after the story ends the ne'er do well man actually disappears as he's been made to do, but even more importantly if the woman and her son (and presumably daughter-in-law) will go to America and live far away from the trite scandals of England. This being the second play I've read of Wilde's which emphasizes the benefits of American society over English, I am starting to detect a theme and Wilde has revealed his obvious disdain for England. Interesting for a man so wrapped up in its society..."

We have a much better time than they have. There are far more things forbidden to us than are forbidden to them.In this drawing-room comedy, Wilde sharply criticizes the British society’s different moral standards for women and men. Women are harshly punished, while men walk away. He also admires the American’s “Puritan” values, egalitarianism and straight talk, which are embodied in the young American girl, Hester Worsley. All of which is wrapped in Wilde’s usual free-wheeling wit. Like other of his works, this one is full of sharp quotes."

I'm taking an Oscar Wilde class this semester, and we're entering the play unit, and I think this was a good way to introduce his longford work. Personally, I think it's a crime that Wilde only wrote one novel. I think his characterization is so strong within his plays, which is amazing considering we lack a lot of the inner characterization and description that a novel can afford. This take on the idea of the single Victorian mother is well done, with the play ending without her having to marry Lord Illingworth to atone for her sins. 10/10 This play had feminism.Honestly, I overall really enjoyed it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I found the first act to be pretty slow and unnecessary for the actual plot of the play. "

148,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44466555-esraa-jad,Rating 3 out of 5,مراجعة مسرحية #امرأة_بلا_أهمية #أوسكار_وايلد لا شك أن الكاتب الأيرلندي ذائع الصيت انقسم الجمهور والنقاد في تقييمه، فمسرحياته تجمع ما بين السطحية في بعض أبعادها والعمق في أبعاد أخرى، كما أن وايلد كان مهتما بالجمال الأدبي اكثر من أي شيء آخر حتى ولو كان على حساب الحبكة والقصة فهو يكتب كما يقول ليظهر جمال الأدب ليس إلا لا يهمه في ذلك المعايير أو الأخلاقيات أو القيم .على الرغم من هذا القول فأنا لم أجد هذا في هذه المسرحية، وهذه تجربتي الأولى مع أوسكار وايلد وبالتالي لا يمكنني الحكم على مجمل أعماله، لكن هنا كان وايلد ومسرحيته تدعم الأخلاق والمثل العليا وتطالب بالحق والعدل.المسرحية عبارة عن أربع فصول في بيت إحد أثرياء لندن والفصل الأخير في بيت موظف بسيط.في الفصل الأول عرض مجموعة من النساء وازواجهم يتحدثون عن المجتمع والفارق بين لندن وأمريكا في حضور زائرة أمريكية لكن المشكلة في هذا الفصل هى الملل فقد احتاج الكثير من الصفحات ليدمجني مع الشخصيات ولأفهم خلفية كل واحد منهم ونظرته للأمور وعن أي شيء يتحدثون.أما في الفصل الثاني تبدأ الأمور تظهر بشكل أوضح فيعرض الكاتب وجهة نظر النساء في الرجال ووجهة نظر الرجال في النساء ووجهة نظر كل منهم في الحياة الزوجية والخلل الواضح الموجود في المجتمع الراقي، فالرجال يرون أن النساء عاطفيات ومتسلطات والنساء ترى أن الرجال لا يستطيعون إدارة شؤونهم بأنفسهم وعلى الرغم من ذلك يحاولون أن يظهروا بصورة العارفين لكل شيء، وهذا بالإضافة إلى الندية بينهم .ثم يتطرقون إلى الحديث عن عقوبة المجتمع للرجل والمرأة إذا وقعوا في الخطيئة وأن المجتمع يظلم المرأة بينما الرجل لا يحمل أي إثم ويعيش وكأن شيئا لم يكن ويظهر في الفصل الثالث والرابع شخصية تقلب الموازين رأسا على عقب وهى المرأة التي بلا أهمية والتي تدور حولها المسرحية وعقدتها من هى تلك المرأة ؟ وما صلتها بأولئك؟ وما هو رد فعل الزائرة الأمريكية عندما تعرف قصتها؟ ولولا هذين الفصلين لأعطيت المسرحية نجمتين بالكاد لكن هذين الفصلين رفعا التقييم فالأحداث وتسلسلها والحوار كانا ممتازين نسيت أن أقول أنه عقد مقارنة بين الحياة في لندن وفي أمريكا وبين رأي المرأة في امريكا وفي لندن في الزواج الغريب أن الاعتدال كان في مصلحة الامريكان فلا أعرف كيف انقلب الحال بهذا الشكل المريع الآن؟ما أعجبني حقا في المسرحية أنه بدأها بالحديث عن امرأة بلا أهمية ثم يعطيها كل الأهمية لتنتهى المسرحية برجل بلا أهمية فعلا، كانت نقلة سلسلة وجميلة العيوب: أن الأبعاد النفسية لم تكن واضحة بالنسبة لكل الشخصيات منها شخصيات رئيسية مثل الفتاة الأمريكية التي لم أعرف شيئا عنها بشكل وافي لماذا هى هنا بالتحديد؟ وكيف وافقت على الزواج من فتى بريطاني بهذه السرعة؟ وما هى أبعادها النفسية؟ كانت هذه الفتاة بمثابة البطل المثالي الذي يظهر من العدم لان المسرحية تحتاج إلى صوت الحق وفقطالتقييم العام: ثلاث نجوم ونصف

My Thoughts
"
150,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/130193782-norah,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wilde is truly quite an incredible man, reading his plays has been such a joy and I’m immensely excited to read more of his work! This play in particular has proven me wrong in detesting plays; which is a feeling that is growing faint as I expose myself to some of the most incredible playwrights especially those of the modern era~ there is something about the irony of importance in Wilde’s works, always tickles my ego... "
151,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108403222-ada,Rating 4 out of 5,"breaking news: oscar wilde plagiarizes himself! some of the dialogues seemed extremely familiar from the picture of dorian gray, but they are good dialogues, so who am i to complain?witty as always. wilde makes many comments on gender politics that are sometimes presented in jest or by characters who are outsiders, but they come through as sincere. the gender dynamics are reversed - though the woman is the one harmed and outcast, she is the one who ends up loved and in the right. the play ends with a man of no importance instead. "
152,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/152255602-aidan-cooper,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5play for class. oscar wilde is so fucking witty; his writing is so singular and charming that i just fall in love with him every time. this is my first play of his, and it’s melodramatic as hell but satirical in its melodrama, and i thoroughly enjoyed my time with it — found myself smiling most of the way through. it has real punch too; it very clearly emphasizes and supports the role of single women in the late 19th century. it is pointed and articulated tactfully, and has a sprinkle of that dorian gray pizzazz that i’ve realized i’ve missed so much."
153,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1162892-j,Rating 4 out of 5,"A charming delight that touches on serious issues. It's almost as if Wilde were writing a rather pointed response to Scandinavian serious drama of Ibsen and Strindberg. Those two authors make of infidelity and illegitimacy an agonized drama, whereas Wilde dances on these subjects as though he were laughing explicitly at the overwrought hand-wringing and agonizing of those dramatists."
154,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38901357-elizabeth,Rating 5 out of 5,"I really enjoyed this. It would make an excellent book club read; there would be a lot to discuss on a moral level. I would love to see this performed, too. It’s one of those tricky works where you don’t quite know whose side to be on because the main characters, even when they seem quite awful, have a human face. I will definitely be re-reading this in the future. "
155,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63291640-sabina,Rating 5 out of 5,"Oscar Wilde's plays are something else entirely. Witty, sharp, beautifully written. After reading The Importance of being Earnest i didn't think i could like any play better, but i did. This is shorter, starts more slowly, but oh the power it conveys. It is so progressive, so feministic for its time. Again, I've written down so many quotes out of it cause they are just beautiful or funny. I don't know, this made me very proud and sentimental. Loved it."
156,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/135256393-vilte,Rating 3 out of 5,"Rating - 3 / 5To be perfectly honest i had no idea what was happening half of this play , just kinda went with it. Also turns out I read this like a year or two ago on my Europe trip and still I have no idea what happened in this book both of the times. It turns clear in the third scene but everything before is just ""ah yes, reading"". Also I don't know if I'm just dumb but I have no idea what morals any of these characters hold , they say so much different stuff about their beliefs in 5 seconds and... I like the ending though thats why it's 3 stars !"

No soy mucho de teatro, pero entre el lenguaje pomposo y los personajes me he sentido inmerso en la época. Ver cómo han cambiado los pensamientos desde entonces y que algunas cosas siguen vigentes también sorprende."
158,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108833682-iain-clowes,Rating 4 out of 5,"While reality TV has taken a lot of the gravitas out of this plot today, the text remains genuinely scandalous. Wilde's excellence at conversation dazzles throughout, and each character remains firmly nuanced - our voice of anti-classist comes out as a firm paternalist, our voice of innocence betrays a misogynistic naivety. A joyful read"
159,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34915127-raegan,Rating 5 out of 5,A well-woven play!It was difficult getting into this one due to all the characters being thrown at me all at once. Mrs. Allonby & Lord Illingworth's scenes were entertaining. I enjoyed the serious tone paired with witty remarks. I always love Wilde's criticism of English society and the rich. Another good one!

The two plays have very similar themes actually, but this one was a bit too melodramatic for me, and the main figures felt somewhat undeveloped. But still witty and highly quotable, with some great monologues."

The Ideal Man, then, in his relations to US. LADY CAROLINE. He would probably be extremely realistic. MRS. CAROLINE. The Ideal Man! Oh, the Ideal Man should talk to us as if we were goddesses, and treat us as if we were children. He should refuse all our serious requests, and gratify every one of our whims. He should encourage us to have caprices, and forbid us to have missions. He should always say much more than he means, and always mean much more than he says.LADY HUNSTANTON. But how could he do both, dear? MRS. ALLONBY. He should never run down other pretty women. That would show he had no taste, or make one suspect that he had too much. No; he should be nice about them all, but say that somehow they don't attract him. LADY STUTFIELD. Yes, that is always very, very pleasant to hear about other women. MRS. ALLONBY. If we ask him a question about anything, he should give us an answer all about ourselves. He should invariably praise us for whatever qualities he knows we haven't got. But he should be pitiless, quite pitiless, in reproaching us for the virtues that we have never dreamed of possessing. He should never believe that we know the use of useful things. That would be unforgiveable. But he should shower on us everything we don't want. LADY CAROLINE. As far as I can see, he is to do nothing but pay bills and compliments. MRS. ALLONBY. He should persistently compromise us in public, and treat us with absolute respect when we are alone. And yet he should be always ready to have a perfectly terrible scene, whenever we want one, and to become miserable, absolutely miserable, at a moment's notice, and to overwhelm us with just reproaches in less than twenty minutes, and to be positively violent at the end of half an hour, and to leave us for ever at a quarter to eight, when we have to go and dress for dinner. And when, after that, one has seen him for really the last time, and he has refused to take back the little things he has given one, and promised never to communicate with one again, or to write one any foolish letters, he should be perfectly broken-hearted, and telegraph to one all day long, and send one little notes every half-hour by a private hansom, and dine quite alone at the club, so that every one should know how unhappy he was. And after a whole dreadful week, during which one has gone about everywhere with one's husband, just to show how absolutely lonely one was, he may be given a third last parting, in the evening, and then, if his conduct has been quite irreproachable, and one has behaved really badly to him, he should be allowed to admit that he has been entirely in the wrong, and when he has admitted that, it becomes a woman's duty to forgive, and one can do it all over again from the beginning, with variations. LADY HUNSTANTON. How clever you are, my dear! You never mean a single word you say. LADY STUTFIELD. Thank you, thank you. It has been quite, quite entrancing. I must try and remember it all. There are such a number of details that are so very, very important. LADY CAROLINE. But you have not told us yet what the reward of the Ideal Man is to be. MRS. ALLONBY. His reward? Oh, infinite expectation. That is quite enough for him.********************************************************************************************GERALD. It is very difficult to understand women, is it not? LORD ILLINGWORTH. You should never try to understand them. Women are pictures. Men are problems. If you want to know what a woman really means - which, by the way, is always a dangerous thing to do - look at her, don't listen to her. GERALD. But women are awfully clever, aren't they? LORD ILLINGWORTH. One should always tell them so. But, to the philosopher, my dear Gerald, women represent the triumph of matter over mind - just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals. GERALD. How then can women have so much power as you say they have? LORD ILLINGWORTH. The history of women is the history of the worst form of tyranny the world has ever known. The tyranny of the weak over the strong. It is the only tyranny that lasts. GERALD. But haven't women got a refining influence? LORD ILLINGWORTH. Nothing refines but the intellect. GERALD. Still, there are many different kinds of women, aren't there? LORD ILLINGWORTH. Only two kinds in society: the plain and the coloured.GERALD. But there are good women in society, aren't there? LORD ILLINGWORTH. Far too many. GERALD. But do you think women shouldn't be good? LORD ILLINGWORTH. One should never tell them so, they'd all become good at once. Women are a fascinatingly wilful sex. Every woman is a rebel, and usually in wild revolt against herself. GERALD. You have never been married, Lord Illingworth, have you? LORD ILLINGWORTH. Men marry because they are tired; women because they are curious. Both are disappointed. "

202,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/86166395-alfredo-sirica,Rating 4 out of 5,"3,5 stelleSebbene tra le sceneggiature minori di Wilde, risulta un ottimo commento della disparità dei sessi nella Londra di fine '800, che echeggia in parte ancora oggi. Per quanto abbia trovato eccessivamente generalizzanti e ardite le distinzioni che l'autore attribuisce ai due sessi, in una sceneggiatura a tratti stucchevolmente melodrammatica, ne rimane una morale finale importante e universalmente condivisibile, che stupisce per la sua attualità. Anticipando il movimento femminista, infatti, quest'opera mira all'emancipazione dai costrutti sociali che condizionano la nostra percezione di una stessa azione se commessa da un uomo piuttosto che da una donna, alterandone il nostro giudizio. Se per una mentalità dell'epoca i fatti qui narrati potevano descrivere una donna senza importanza, per una mentalità più moderna (quale supportata da Wilde) ad avere poco valore è invece il personaggio maschile."

These plays should be read in one sitting so as not to miss the remarkable way which Wilde fluidly unpacks and portrays a story’s action that takes place within a brief twenty-four hours. Brevity truly is the soul of wit.Quotes:LORD ILLINGWORTH: You women live by your emotions and for them. You have no philosophy of life.MRS. ARBUTHNOT: You are right. We women live by our emotions and for them. By our passions, and for them if, if you will. I have two passions, Lord Illingworth: my love of him [her son], my hate of you. You cannot kill those. They feed each other.ILLINGWORTH: What sort of love is that which needs to have hate as its brother?MRS. ARBUTHNOT: It is the sort of love I have for Gerald. Do you think that terrible? Well, it is terrible. All love is terrible. All love is tragedy.-A Woman of No Importance  For when I marry you, Rachel, there are some ambitions I shall have to surrender. High ambitions, too, if any ambition is high.  As George Harfold I had everything I wanted. Now I have merely everything that other people want, which isn’t nearly so pleasant.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT: But we are disgraced. We rank among the outcasts. Gerald is nameless. The sins of the parents should be visited on the children. It is God’s law.HESTER: I was wrong. God’s law is only Love.  Who, being loved, is poor? Oh, no one.  Hearts live by being wounded. Pleasure may turn a heart to stone, riches may make it callous, but sorrow – oh, sorrow, cannot break it.  For when they find life bitter they blame us [mothers] for it, and when they find it sweet we do not taste its sweetness with them.  And you needed love, for you were weakly, and only love could have kept you alive. Only love can keep anyone alive.  What have women who have not sinned to do with me, or I with them? We do not understand each other.  I hope you don’t think you have exhausted life, Mr. Arbuthnot. When a man says that, one knows that life has exhausted him.  MRS ALLONBY: I delight in men over seventy. They always offer one the devotion of a lifetime. I think seventy an ideal age for a man.  Lord Illingworth says that all influence is bad, but that a good influence is the worst in the world.  LORD ILLINGWORTH: To look at anything that is inconstant is charming nowadays.MRS. ALLONBY: You have your looking-glass.LORD ILLINGWORTH: It is unkind. It merely shows me my wrinklesMRS. ALLONBY: Mine is better behaved. It never tells me the truth.LORD ILLINGWORTH: Then it is in love with you.  How charming you are, dear Lord Illingworth. You always find out that one’s most glaring fault is one’s important virtue. You have the most comforting view of life.  Moderation is a fatal thing … Nothing succeeds like excess.  LADY HUNSTANTON: I think on the whole that the secret of life is to take things very, very easily.MRS. ALLONBY: The secret of life is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming.LADY STUTFIELD: The secret of life is to appreciate the pleasure of being terribly, terribly deceived.LADY KELVIL: The secret of life is to resist temptation, Lady Stutfield.LORD ILLINGWORTH: There is no secret of life. Life’s aim, if it has one, is simply to be always looking for temptations. There are not nearly enough. I sometimes pass a whole day without coming across a single one. It is quite dreadful. It makes one so nervous about the future.LADY HUNSTANTON (shakes her fan at him): I don’t know how it is, Lord Illingworth, but everything you have said today seems to me excessively immoral. It has been most interesting, listening to you.LORD ILLINGWORTH: All thought is immoral. Its very essence is destruction. If you think of anything, you kill it. Nothing survives being thought of.  I don’t intend to grow perfect at all. At least, I hope I shan’t. It would be most inconvenient. Women love us for our defects. If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything, even our gigantic intellects.  LORD ILLINGWORTH: The world is simply divided into two classes – those who believe the incredible, like the public – and those who do the improbable –MRS. ALLONBY: Like yourself?LORD ILLINGWOTH: Yes, I am always astonishing myself. It is the only thing that makes life worth living.  To have been well brought up is a great drawback nowadays. It shuts one out from so much.  The only difference between the saint and the sinner is that every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future.  The world has always laughed at its own tragedies, that being the only way in which it has been able to bear them. And that consequently, whatever the world has treated seriously belongs to the comedy side of things.  For the world has been made by fools that wise men should live in it!  When one is in love one begins by deceiving oneself. And one ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls a romance.  LORD ILLINGWORTH: Men marry because they are tired; women because they are curious. Both are disappointed.GERALD: But don’t you think one can be happy when one is married?LORD ILLINGWORTH: Perfectly happy. But the happiness of a married man, my dear Gerald, depends on the people he has not married.GERALD: But if one is in love?LORD ILLINGWORTH: One should always be in love. That is the reason one should never marry.  GERALD: But do you think women shouldn’t be good?LORD ILLINGWORTH: One should never tell them so, they’d all become good at once. Women are a fascinatingly willful sex. Every woman is a rebel, and usually in wild revolt against herself.  Nothing refines but the intellect.  GERALD: It is very difficult to understand women, is it not?LORD ILLINGWORTH: You should never try to understand them. Women are pictures. Men are problems. If you want to know what a woman really means – which, by the way, is always a dangerous thing to do – look at her, don’t listen to her.GERALD: But women are awfully clever, aren’t they?LORD ILLINGWORTH: One should always tell them so. But, to the philosopher, my dear Gerald, women represent the triumph of matter over mind – just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.  GERALD: I suppose society is wonderfully delightful!LORD ILLINGWORTH: To be in it is merely a bore. But to be out of it simply a tragedy. Society is a necessary thing. No man has any real success in this world unless he has got women to back him, and women rule society.  To get into the best society, nowadays, one has either to feed people, amuse people, or shock people – that is all!  GERALD: I don’t know how to talk.LORD ILLINGWORTH: Oh! Talk to every woman as if you loved her, and to every man as if he bored you, and at the end of your first season you will have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact.  A well-tied tie is the first serious step in life.  People nowadays are so absolutely superficial that they don’t understand the philosophy of the superficial.  A man who can dominate a London dinner-table can dominate the world. The future belongs to the dandy. It is the exquisites who are going to rule the world.  Remember that you’ve got on your side the most wonderful thing in the world – youth! There is nothing like youth. The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life. The old are in life’s lumber-room. But youth is the Lord of Life. Youth has a kingdom waiting for it. Everyone is born a king, and most people die in exile, like most kings. To win back my youth, Gerald, there is nothing I wouldn’t do – except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member of the community.  My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value whatsoever. If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.  Don’t be deceived, Rachel. Children begin by loving their parents. After a time they judge them. Rarely, if ever, do they forgive them.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT: He was not discontented till he met you. You have made him so.LORD ILLINGWORTH: Of course I made him so. Discontent is the first step in the progress of a man or a nation.  Duty is what one expects from others, it is not what one does oneself.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT: When a man is old enough to do wrong he should be old enough to do right also.LORD ILLINGWORTH: My dear Rachel, intellectual generalities are always interesting, but generalities in morals mean absolutely nothing.  All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy.No man does. That is his.  After a good dinner one can forgive anybody, even one’s own relations.  You rich people in England, you don’t know how you are living. How could you know? You shut out from your society the gentle and the good. You laugh at the simple and the pure. Living, as you all do, on others and by them, you sneer at self-sacrifice, and if you throw bread to the poor, it is merely to keep them quiet for a season. With all your pomp and wealth and art you don’t know how to live – you don’t even know that. You love the beauty that you can see and touch and handle, the beauty that you can destroy, and do destroy, but of the unseen beauty of life, of a higher life, you no nothing. You have lost life’s secret.  MRS. ALLONBY: The Ideal Man! Oh, the Ideal Man should talk to us as if we were goddesses, and treat us as if we were children. He should refuse all our serious requests, and gratify every one of our whims. He should encourage us to have caprices, and forbid us to have missions. He should always say much more than he means, and always mean much more than he says …He should never run down other pretty women. That would show he had no taste, or make one suspect that he had too much. No; he should be nice about them all, but say that somehow they don’t attract him.LADY STUTFIELD: Yes, that is always very, very pleasant to hear about other women.MRS. ALLONBY: If we ask him a question about anything, he should give us an answer all about ourselves. He should invariably praise us for whatever qualities he knows we haven’t got. He should be pitiless, quite pitiless in reproaching us for the virtues that we have never dreamed of possessing. He should never believe that we know the use of useful things. That would be unforgiveable. But he should shower on us everything we don’t want.LADY CAROLINE: As far as I can see, he is to do nothing but pay bills and compliments.MRS. ALLONBY: He should persistently compromise us in public, and treat us with absolute respect when we are alone. And yet he should be always ready to have a perfectly terrible scene, whenever we want one, and to become miserable, absolutely miserable, at a moment’s notice …LADY HUNSTANTON: How clever you are, my dear! You never mean a single word you say.  Do you know, Lady Caroline, I don’t think the frivolity of the wife has ever anything to do with it. More marriages are ruined nowadays by the common sense of the husband than by anything else. How can a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating her as if she was a perfectly rational being?  Oh, women have become so highly educated, Jane, that nothing should surprise us nowadays, except happy marriages. They apparently are getting remarkably rare.  Men always want to be a woman’s first love. That is their clumsy vanity. We women have a more subtle instinct about things. What we like is to be a man’s last romance.  Oh, dear, no. Earnest is invariably calm. That is one of the reasons he always gets on my nerves. Nothing is so aggravating as calmness. There is something positively brutal about the good temper of most modern men. I wonder we women stand it as well as we do.  Ah, all that I have noticed is that they are horribly tedious when they are good husbands, and abominably conceited when they are not.  MRS ALLONBY: What a comfort it is to get rid of the men for a little!LADY STUTFIELD: Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they?MRS. ALLONBY: Persecute us, I wish they did.LADY HUNSTANTON: My dear!MRS. ALLONBY: The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly happy without us. That is why I think it is every woman’s duty to never leave them alone for a single moment, except for this short breathing space after dinner; without which, I believe, we poor women would be absolutely worn to shadows.  I adore simple pleasures. They are the last refuge of the complex.  LORD ILLINGWORTH: One can survive anything nowadays except death, and live down anything except a good reputation.MRS. ALLONBY: Have you tried a good reputation?LORD ILLINGWORTH: It is one of the many annoyances to which I have never been subjected.  LORD ILLINGWORTH: Don’t you know that I always succeed in whatever I try?MRS. ALLONBY: I am sorry to hear it. We women adore failures. They lean on us.LORD ILLINGWORTH: You worship successes. You cling to them.MRS. ALLONBY: We are the laurels to hide their baldness.LORD ILLINGWORTH: And they need you always, except at the moment of triumph.MRS. ALLONBY: They are uninteresting then.LORD ILLINGWORTH: How tantalizing you are! (A pause.)MRS. ALLONBY: Lord Illingworth, there is one thing I shall always like you for.LORD ILLINGWORTH: Only one thing? And I have so many bad qualities.MRS. ALLONBY: Ah, don’t be too conceited about them. You may lose them as you grow old.LORD ILLINGWORTH: I never intend to grow old. The soul is born old but grows young. That is the comedy of life.MRS. ALLONBY: And the body is born young and grows old. That is life’s tragedy.  I don’t mind plain women being Puritans. It is the only excuse they have for being plain.  One should never trust a woman who tells one her real age. A woman who would tell one that, would tell one anything.  MRS. ALLONBY: Is she such a mystery?LORD ILLINGWORTH: She is more than a mystery – she is a mood.MRS. ALLONBY: Moods don’t last.LORD ILLINGWORTH: It is their chief charm.  MRS. ALLONBY: Curious thing, plain women are always jealous of their husbands, beautiful women never are!LORD ILLINGWORTH: Beautiful women never have time. They are always so occupied in being jealous of other people’s husbands.  LADY STUTFIELD: Ah! The world was made for men and not for women.MRS. ALLONBY: Oh, don’t say that, Lady Stutfield. We have a much better time than they have. There are far more things forbidden to us than are forbidden to them.  MRS. ALLONBY: I think to elope is cowardly. It’s running away from danger. And danger has become so rare in modern life.LADY CAROLINE: As far as I can make out, the young women of the present day seem to make it the sole object of their lives to be always playing with fire.MRS. ALLONBY: The one advantage of playing with fire, Lady Caroline, is that one never gets even singed. It is the people who don’t know how to play with it who get burned up.  HESTER: Nothing should be out of the reach of hope. Life is a hope."

216,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8502789-ami,Rating 2 out of 5,"I found this one a little tedious. It was neither as witty as The Importance of being Earnest nor as moving as Lady Windermere's fan. Like the latter, it touched upon women's unfortunate and precarious place in Society, and on the pain of motherhood. Yet as opposed to Mrs Erlynne, Mrs Arbuthnot was more verbose than demonstrative. That is not to say that I did not sympathize with her plight. Rachel Arbuthnot, who had her son Gerald out of wedlock, discovers suddenly that the man who got her pregnant then refused to marry her, George Harford, now Lord Illingworth, wants to hire Gerald as his private secretary. She is of course devastated to have this man back in her life, and trying to take her son away from her no less. For his part, Illingworth, an immoral and wildly sexist misanthrope, takes the news entirely in stride, and is very pleased to discover Gerald is his son. He almost succeeds in removing him from Rachel, when due to an ill-advised bet with the other completely immoral character of the play, Mrs Allonby, he makes unwanted advances on the girl Gerald is in love with, American heiress Hester Worsley. Gerald is driven to incredible anger and threatens to kill him, before his mother intervenes to stop him, as he cannot possibly kill his own father.Gerald then tries to insist that Mrs Arbuthnot must marry the man who ruined her life, ""for her own sake"". Her impassioned speech in response to this is worth recording: Mrs. Arbuthnot: I do not know it. I do not feel it, nor will I ever stand before God’s altar and ask God’s blessing on so hideous a mockery as a marriage between me and George Harford. I will not say the words the Church bids us to say. I will not say them. I dare not. How could I swear to love the man I loathe, to honour him who wrought you dishonour, to obey him who, in his mastery, made me to sin? No: marriage is a sacrament for those who love each other. It is not for such as him, or such as me. Gerald, to save you from the world’s sneers and taunts I have lied to the world. For twenty years I have lied to the world. I could not tell the world the truth. Who can, ever? But not for my own sake will I lie to God, and in God’s presence. No, Gerald, no ceremony, Church-hallowed or State-made, shall ever bind me to George Harford. It may be that I am too bound to him already, who, robbing me, yet left me richer, so that in the mire of my life I found the pearl of price, or what I thought would be so.Gerald: I don’t understand you now.Mrs. Arbuthnot: Men don’t understand what mothers are. I am no different from other women except in the wrong done me and the wrong I did, and my very heavy punishments and great disgrace. And yet, to bear you I had to look on death. To nurture you I had to wrestle with it. Death fought with me for you. All women have to fight with death to keep their children. Death, being childless, wants our children from us. Gerald, when you were naked I clothed you, when you were hungry I gave you food. Night and day all that long winter I tended you. No office is too mean, no care too lowly for the thing we women love—and oh! how I loved you. Not Hannah, Samuel more. And you needed love, for you were weakly, and only love could have kept you alive. Only love can keep any one alive. And boys are careless often and without thinking give pain, and we always fancy that when they come to man’s estate and know us better they will repay us. But it is not so. The world draws them from our side, and they make friends with whom they are happier than they are with us, and have amusements from which we are barred, and interests that are not ours: and they are unjust to us often, for when they find life bitter they blame us for it, and when they find it sweet we do not taste its sweetness with them . . . You made many friends and went into their houses and were glad with them, and I, knowing my secret, did not dare to follow, but stayed at home and closed the door, shut out the sun and sat in darkness. What should I have done in honest households? My past was ever with me. . . . And you thought I didn’t care for the pleasant things of life. I tell you I longed for them, but did not dare to touch them, feeling I had no right. You thought I was happier working amongst the poor. That was my mission, you imagined. It was not, but where else was I to go? The sick do not ask if the hand that smooths their pillow is pure, nor the dying care if the lips that touch their brow have known the kiss of sin. It was you I thought of all the time; I gave to them the love you did not need: lavished on them a love that was not theirs . . . And you thought I spent too much of my time in going to Church, and in Church duties. But where else could I turn? God’s house is the only house where sinners are made welcome, and you were always in my heart, Gerald, too much in my heart. For, though day after day, at morn or evensong, I have knelt in God’s house, I have never repented of my sin. How could I repent of my sin when you, my love, were its fruit! Even now that you are bitter to me I cannot repent. I do not. You are more to me than innocence. I would rather be your mother—oh! much rather!—than have been always pure . . . Oh, don’t you see? don’t you understand? It is my dishonour that has made you so dear to me. It is my disgrace that has bound you so closely to me. It is the price I paid for you—the price of soul and body—that makes me love you as I do. Oh, don’t ask me to do this horrible thing. Child of my shame, be still the child of my shame!Overall however this felt a little bit like the plot of one of those silly Christmas movies, with the poor hardworking mother, the immoral estranged father, the honest son who is ignorant of his family history, and the beautiful, rich, and good woman who loves him and ends up saving everyone. And it was really tedious, so much so that it did not feel like Wilde's writing in places.Some lines were however very good, either incredibly hilarious or scathing social commentary that remains valuable. Particularly Illingworth's comment that the problem of poverty is actually an issue of slavery, and that the very rich understand charity as a means of distracting the poor from the reality of their situation, stands even today, as poverty remains a widespread and pressing problem in the UK. Mrs. Allonby: But somehow, I feel sure that if I lived in the country for six months, I should become so unsophisticated that no one would take the slightest notice of me.Lady Hunstanton: I assure you, dear, that the country has not that effect at all. Why, it was from Melthorpe, which is only two miles from here, that Lady Belton eloped with Lord Fethersdale. I remember the occurrence perfectly. Poor Lord Belton died three days afterwards of joy, or gout. I forget which. We had a large party staying here at the time, so we were all very much interested in the whole affair.Mrs. Allonby: I think to elope is cowardly. It’s running away from danger. And danger has become so rare in modern life.*Lady Stutfield: The world says that Lord Illingworth is very, very wicked.Lord Illingworth: But what world says that, Lady Stutfield? It must be the next world. This world and I are on excellent terms. Lady Stutfield: Every one I know says you are very, very wicked.Lord Illingworth: It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about, nowadays, saying things against one behind one’s back that are absolutely and entirely true.*Lady Caroline: These American girls carry off all the good matches. Why can’t they stay in their own country? They are always telling us it is the Paradise of women.Lord Illingworth: It is, Lady Caroline. That is why, like Eve, they are so extremely anxious to get out of it.*Lady Hunstanton: Politics are in a sad way everywhere, I am told. They certainly are in England. Dear Mr. Cardew is ruining the country. I wonder Mrs. Cardew allows him. I am sure, Lord Illingworth, you don’t think that uneducated people should be allowed to have votes?Lord Illingworth: I think they are the only people who should.Kelvil: Do you take no side then in modern politics, Lord Illingworth?Lord Illingworth: One should never take sides in anything, Mr. Kelvil. Taking sides is the beginning of sincerity, and earnestness follows shortly afterwards, and the human being becomes a bore. However, the House of Commons really does very little harm. You can’t make people good by Act of Parliament,—that is something.Kelvil: You cannot deny that the House of Commons has always shown great sympathy with the sufferings of the poor.Lord Illingworth: That is its special vice. That is the special vice of the age. One should sympathise with the joy, the beauty, the colour of life. The less said about life’s sores the better, Mr. Kelvil.Kelvil: Still our East End is a very important problem.Lord Illingworth: Quite so. It is the problem of slavery. And we are trying to solve it by amusing the slaves.Lady Hunstanton: Certainly, a great deal may be done by means of cheap entertainments, as you say, Lord Illingworth. Dear Dr. Daubeny, our rector here, provides, with the assistance of his curates, really admirable recreations for the poor during the winter. And much good may be done by means of a magic lantern, or a missionary, or some popular amusement of that kind.(...)Kelvil: May I ask, Lord Illingworth, if you regard the House of Lords as a better institution than the House of Commons?Lord Illingworth: A much better institution, of course. We in the House of Lords are never in touch with public opinion. That makes us a civilised body.*Lady Hunstanton: Are you going, Mrs. Allonby?Mrs. Allonby: Just as far as the conservatory. Lord Illingworth told me this morning that there was an orchid there as beautiful as the seven deadly sins.Lady Hunstanton: My dear, I hope there is nothing of the kind. I will certainly speak to the gardener."
217,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10400378-charles,Rating 4 out of 5,"I did not think much of this at first, I must admit. Wilde reused many lines/quotes from his other works, as is evident here. However, I am glad to admit that further reading proved me wrong, and this play is a tremendous improvement over 'Lady Windermere's Fan' in terms of subject matter and themes.Lord Illingworth is so much similar to Lord Henry in 'The Picture of Dorian Gray'. He is regarded as wicked, and indeed a bad influence. His philosophies of life are selfish, intrinsically hedonistic and 'dangerous'. Others succumb to his wit and charm though, he is considered to be the 'life' in many parties. Nobody objected when Lord Illingworth assigned a certain youth, Gerald Arbuthnot, to be his secretary abroad. Many were happy for the young man, as Gerald had no family titles or fortune. The surprise twist is in the character of Mrs Arbuthnot, Gerald's mother. For some reason she objected heavily against her son dealing with such a man, even if Lord Illingworth proposed a bright future for her son. Being unmarried, however, Mrs Arbuthnot is regarded as a woman of no importance, and her only son (initially) paid no heed to her advice. Gerald thinks that his post as secretary to Lord Illingworth will ascertain his marriage to Miss Hester Worsley, the 'Puritan' American. I will not reveal the surprise twist at the end of the play, but this much I can say; This play emphasizes the discriminating English Society of the late 19th Century. It was alright for an unmarried man to elope with any one he wished, and still be regarded as the most interesting person in a party. However, the woman the man elopes with is ruined forever, psychologically and socially. She is then considered in society as a woman of no importance, of no consequence. This play reveals how unjust society was at that time against women. One feels considerable pity for Mrs Arbuthnot, but Wilde makes her as a 'hero' character in this play. Despite the callousness of such a society, Mrs Arbuthnot emerges triumphant both as a mother and a woman. She resists the taunts of Lord Illingworth's claim on not just her son, but on her as well. With all his money and property,Lord Illingworth is revealed in the end as a hollow and manipulative character, indeed, a man of no importance... Without revealing the surprise twist, I attempted to at least try to explain the play's underlying theme. Wilde writes in such an elegant manner, that it is hard not to enjoy any of his plays."
218,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5634382-aamil-syed,Rating 4 out of 5,"Well of course, Oscar Wilde doesn't need a stamp of approval. But I feel compelled to talk about his work because I don't want anyone to miss the pleasure of reading him. And the best thing is that most of his work is available on project Gutenberg.The first book by him that I read, was The Picture of Dorian Gray. The book shook me so much that I couldn't complete it. It was real and it changed my perspective on life. I'm planning to complete it this year.Now, on to 'A woman of no importance'. I know that technically, it's not a book. And I tried to get an audio book of people voice-acting it. But, I didn't like it that much, so I decided to read it. This was the first time I have ever read a play by Oscar Wilde and it was the most amazing experience ever! Every dialogue was superb. So much thought has been put into this short and simple script that you can read it time and again and be amazed by the depth of writing. Wilde's self-contradictory style of philosophizing is a delight to read.I don't think there's anyone who has a better grasp on the complicated nature of human relationships than Oscar Wilde. He uses that to make this play about the relationships so much more profound!I'll just stop at that because I'm not qualified to say more about the play than that it is a beautifully written story, replete with brilliant aphorisms. See for yourself.Since it's such a short play, you can even read it online. The University of Adelaide has a beautiful online version that I recommend.Twenty-sixth book reviewed as part of the 130 Challenge | Read on my blog"
219,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/115681193-vishalan-kumaran,Rating 4 out of 5,"""A Woman of No Importance"" stands as an everlasting monument, bearing testament to Wilde's unassailable genius in blending scintillating wit, caustic satire, and societal introspection. It is an iridescent tapestry, meticulously woven with indelible characters and intellectually invigorating discourse. Whether one is an ardent devotee of Wilde's prodigious talents or merely seeks the thrill of a masterfully crafted play, ""A Woman of No Importance"" stands resolute as an imperative literary sojourn, leaving an indelible imprint upon the grand tapestry of human nature and the relentless judgment of society."
220,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"From my review of The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays: ""A Woman of No Importance"" returns us to Wilde's present day, and it's quite amusing as well. ""Oscar Wilde's audacious drama of social scandal centres around the revelation of Mrs Arbuthnot's long-concealed secret. A house party is in full swing at Lady Hunstanton's country home, when it is announced that Gerald Arbuthnot has been appointed secretary to the sophisticated, witty Lord Illingworth. Gerald's mother stands in the way of his appointment, but fears to tell him why, for who will believe Lord Illingworth to be a man of no importance?"" I really loved the banter between Lord Illingsworth and Mrs. Allonby; they're both rather nasty people, but they certainly get along pretty well, and have interesting conversations. In the notes, it's pointed out that Wilde originally had many of the quips written just for Lord Illingsworth, but dividing them up cemented the rapport between the two characters. It was certainly effective, and I enjoyed reading their exchanges. ""A Woman Of No Importance"" had a great plot, and it was also quite moving and skillfully, subtly written. There were several amusing quips, most of them said by Lord Illingsworth. For example, he says, ""one should never take sides in anything...taking sides is the beginning of sincerity, and earnestness follows shortly afterwards, and the human being becomes a bore."" I found that quite interesting and funny; it's also sort of true. I was fascinated by the character of Lord Illingsworth; he rather cruelly manipulates Mrs. Arbuthnot, verbally and pyschologically, yet he has a charm about him. He's more than just the stereotypically cruel and wanton villain.

225,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5338330-shriya,Rating 5 out of 5,"'A Woman of No Importance' is perhaps one of the most significant contributions of Wilde to English Literature. A crisp slap on the face of a hypocritical society like that of the late 19th century England, this play is entertaining, interesting and deeply moving. A craft of Wilde's immeasurable wit, 'A Woman of No Importance' has some absolutely ridiculous characters like Mrs. Allonby, a hopeless coquette, Lady Caroline Pontefract, an annoyingly bossy woman (who could be Hermione Granger's great grand-aunt) and Lady Stutfield, a naïve and rather foolish woman who shows her deficiency in vocabulary by repetition of phrases like 'Very, very' and her idiocy by dumbly agreeing to everybody's opinion and following none. There is the Archdeacon Daubeny, whose wife was so talented once in every field known and is so ill now that it's a medical miracle she's still alive!And then there's Lord Illingworth a character so hideous and adorable at he same time, you know not what to feel about him! He's full of wise sayings, some of which arouse deep sympathy for him, some which totally repulse the reader. He is a sinner, a victim, an honourable man and a wretch all at the same time. But the strongest character in the play is Mrs. Arbuthnot, who, though called 'A Woman of No Importance' is Wilde's spokeswoman and the most important character in the entire play, who gives it a new turn and through the means of her emotional strength, gives it a new ending! "
226,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5024047-tom,Rating 4 out of 5,"""A Woman of No Importance"" is another of Oscar Wilde's ""Society Plays,"" and it certainly carries on his portrayal of English capital-s ""Society"" as being vapid, shallow, and cruel. In this case, the title is ironic, since Mrs. Arbuthnot is one of the only decent characters in the play.The play starts at a country estate, where Sir John Pontefract and his wife are entertaining guests. Among them is Hester Worsley, a young woman visiting from America. She and Gerald Arbuthnot--son of Mrs Arbuthnot--have been dating. Gerald has just accepted a job as Secretary to Lord Illingworth, an oily and venomously charming bachelor. Gerald is excited by the new position, as it will provide him the means with which to marry Hester. Also, Lord Illingworth serves as a type of ideal for Gerald, who grew up fatherless. The clashes between Lord Illingworth, Hester, Gerald, and his mother shine against the dull emptiness of the various Lords and Ladies also in attendance. I grew weary of this play by halfway through the second act. Wilde writes splendid epigrams, but sometimes all the other characters exist to feed Lord Illingworth set-up lines. It's like comedy skeet.In the third and fourth acts, though, Wilde really develops his story. The play reveals a secret or two, and it works toward a surprisingly satisfying conclusion. If you get bogged down early on, as I did, stick it out. Oscar knew what he was doing after all."

Pleasure may turn a heart to stone, riches may make it callous, but sorrow - oh, sorrow cannot break it."" Wilde's A Woman of No Importance is expectedly a witty drawing room play regarding societal and gender norms, targeting specifically ""disgraced"" women. The First Act sets up the dialogue between upperclass women and their discussions on how they view other women and men alike, showcasing the unreasonable standards and vastly different views on women. It highlights the stark views Lord Illingworth has on women, especially, and as the Acts continue, it only progressively shows how unfair ""fallen"" women are treated, and how easily women are written off as women of no importance. The ending is satisfying and immensely touching, through a discussion between a mother and son, and a woman who finally takes Arbuthnot's side despite how hard Arbuthnot is on herself for her past mistakes. Despite the entertaining dialogue and exciting unfolding of events in the later acts, I found that there was a bit disconnect between the characters and overall, at many points, was bored.Regardless, Wilde created a very interesting drawing room play focused on exhausting double standards in the Victorian Era."

I have always wanted to read an Oscar Wilde novel as my favourite quote of his is; ""Life imitates art far more than art imitates life."" This book is very comical as well as it is hard hitting and sad. From what I have taken up in this book is that I saw it as a party filled with sins and sinners. But what got me the most was it was how equality for women lacked so much back in the 1890's. That this was completely about how much women were shamed back then and told what to do and act in a certain way. That men could get away with things and women would have to bear both of the sin on themselves. I overall really enjoyed this book and anyone who is interested in the feminist movement should 100% read this. Oscar Wilde has done so well and his writing is so cleverly portrayed and also comical. My favourite quote from this book is : "" Every woman is a rebel, and usually in wild revolt against herself."""

 - Wilde I've read that A Woman of No Importance is seen as one of Wilde's weaker plays because, literally, nothing happens in the first act. While this might be true, my favourite parts of Wilde's plays are the scenes where gentlefolk accumulate to criticise the world around them. The acts might not be plot-heavy, but I would argue that most of Wilde's greatest quotes stem from these acts.And Ms. Arbuthnot is pure gold.Reread: March 2021"

Apparently, this play is not considered one of his best, however, I enjoyed it just as much as the other works of Wilde that I've read (Lady Windermere's Fan and Salome). Lady Caroline and Lady Hunstanton are insufferable, Lord Illingworth and Mrs Allonby, the cynics. Packed with clever and quotable lines. Amusing. Much sympathy for Mrs Arbuthnot - her speech about motherhood in Act 4 is excellent. Plenty of gender politics highlighting the injustices of a male-dominated society. "
238,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"This play is not the typical Oscar Wilde comedy, but rather a drama that has some amusing lines. It's fairly melodramatic at times and a bit preachy. The most interesting aspect of the plot is what seems to be his use of Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, as if he sought to explore how the situation of Hester Prynne and Arthur Dimmesdale would play out in non-Puritan, late Victorian English society. Wilde's resolution, much like Hawthorne's would probably still have given Mrs. Hawthorne a headache, but that's not a bad thing."

This play has the added element of the strange/amusing sort of misogyny one only gets from a gay man writing a work with a (superficially, anyway) feminist message. Wilde does a deliberately excellent job of making the ""moral"" of the story seem rather silly.That acknowledged and set aside, I enjoyed the play."

248,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9809633-matthew,Rating 3 out of 5,"I am not sure if Oscar Wilde would regard himself as a feminist, but his stage plays certainly provide much that would appeal to advocates of women’s rights. The inferior social position of women in the late nineteenth century, and the imbalanced moral judgements that society imposes on women are recurring themes in Wilde’s plays.We might even say that the women are the stronger characters and the driving forces in all of Wilde’s plays. In Lady Windermere’s Fan and An Ideal Husband, the action is propelled by the female characters, and the male characters act only in reaction to the situation that has been created by the women.The men move the story along in The Importance of Being Earnest, but the women prove to be more than a match for them, and it is clear who calls the shots. Salome tells the story of a frustrated and baulked woman who finds other ways to use the power that society has denied her, rather like Hedda Tesman in Ibsen’s play, Hedda Gabler.In A Woman of No Importance, the action is not led by any of the characters, but it is clear that the main moral issue presented by the play relates to the mistreatment of a woman, and that it is with her that Wilde’s sympathy lies. To Lord Illingworth, Mrs Arbuthnot is a woman of no importance, a former mistress who left him when he refused to marry her so their child could be born in wedlock. It is harder to appreciate the significance of this today, and the modern reader might be irritated by Mrs Arbuthnot’s constant self-abasement and brooding on her sins. However Victorian morality held that sex outside wedlock was wrong, and that the woman who did so was tainted and disgraced, unfit to form part of good society. This creates a dilemma for Mrs Arbuthnot who has concealed her past from everyone, including her son, Gerald. Now Gerald wishes to improve his social status by becoming the secretary of Lord Illingworth, unaware that the aristocrat is his father. To complicate matters Gerald is in love with an American Puritan called (what else?) Hester. Clearly Wilde has heard of The Scarlet Letter. This Puritan is untainted however, and disapproves of women who sin outside of wedlock.To stay quiet about Lord Illingworth’s relation to Gerald is impossible for Mrs Arbuthnot. She cannot stand the thought of him benefitting from, and perhaps being corrupted by, his father. However to reveal the truth is to risk losing Gerald’s regard for her, and to damage his prospects with Hester.A point that Wilde returns to again and again is the contrast between the position of Lord Illingworth and the lower status of Mrs Arbuthnot. He has committed the same sin as her, but he is respected in society and much sought-after, whereas for her an illegitimate child means ruin and censure. When Mrs Arbuthnot finally reveals the truth to her son, his first instinct is to try to force her to marry his father, thereby making their relationship respectable, even though she now despises Illingworth. We see again the absurdity of moral double standards that consider that a woman should choose an option that will make her unhappy simply because it is considered right by society.In the event, the play ends in a typical Wildean fudge. Hester proves to be surprisingly accommodating. Her morals shift overnight, and she helps Mrs Arbuthnot to persuade Gerald not to push marriage on his mother. By the end, the three of them find happiness together, and Mrs Arbuthnot rejects the attentions of Lord Illingworth. It seems that he has now become ‘A man of no importance’.This turnaround to a happy ending may seem unsatisfactory, but it is in line with Wilde’s other comedies. Wilde did not believe in asceticism, sacrifices and pure moral standards. He recognised that life is only supportable when people accept a grey compromise.Nonetheless Hester’s change of heart occurs a little too abruptly, and it is regrettable that nearly two acts of the play amble along without much happening, leaving only limited space for the denouement. However the main story is not one of Wilde’s best, and involves too much hand-wringing and condemnation for my tastes.Wilde himself does not seem especially interested in his story, and so much of the play is a collection of witty aphorisms and bon mots uttered by characters that are only peripheral to the main story. The play contains many of Wilde’s most famous sayings:“Men marry because they are tired; women because they are curious. Both are disappointed.”“It is perfectly monstrous the way people go about, nowadays, saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.”“The Book of Life begins with a man and a woman in a garden. It ends with Revelations.”“One should never trust a woman who tells one her real age. A woman who would tell one that would tell one anything.”“The English country gentleman galloping after a fox – the unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable.”How far one enjoys this play depends more on one’s appreciation of Wilde’s witticisms than it does on following the story. I find Wilde’s sayings mildly amusing, but not as wise or clever as they are often thought to be. However it is still possible to be charmed by Wilde’s elegance and his consummate control of the English language."

289,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/154295775-cypher,Rating 4 out of 5,"this is my third Oscar Wilde play, and i can say they all seem to have the same theme and style, i can't say i found this to be as much a drama, as more similar to the other plays i've encountered, they are full of wit, humour, caricature characters and critical of high society. this one, unfortunately, does not stand out the same way as The Importance of Being Earnest, one of the last things Wilde wrote before he died, in which fact we can also see how his skill matured and transformed with his life, his ideas resonating more clearly and his style shining more bright.funny until the end, the play starts off full of tragicomic remarks, then the major moment is the uncovering of the dramatic situation of the wronged mother to her son, to which the American friend briefly suggest moving to America as the only solution to escape disgrace. the boy's father, who is found in the garden trying to kiss his's sons future wife, will then try to ignore everything and tell the mother she has become too judgemental. some funny quotes:“when good Americans die they go to Paris, when bad Americans die they go to America.” (the contempt of english and french society for America and the popular culture of Paris)""the only form of serious intellect I know is the British intellect”“[I was told that in the garden] there is an orchid as beautiful as the Seven Deadly Sins. - My dear, I hope nothing of the kind, I will certainly speak to the gardener.” “beautiful women are too busy being jealous of other women’s husbands”“So much marriage is certainly not becoming. Twenty years of romance make a woman look like a ruin; but twenty years of marriage make her something like a public building.”“nothing spoils a romance so much as a sense of humour in a woman”“The Book Of Life begins with a man and a woman in a garden - It ends with Revelations.”“[today] all the married men live like bachelors and all the bachelors live like married men”“How can a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating her as if she were a perfectly rational being? (…) The History of Woman is very different. We have always been picturesque protests against the mere existence of common sense. We saw its dangers from the first. (…) The Ideal Man! Oh, the Ideal Man should talk to us as if we were goddesses, and treat us as if we were children. He should refuse all our serious requests, and gratify every one of our whims. He should encourage us to have caprices, and forbid us to have missions. He should always say much more than he means, and always mean much more than he says. (…) He should never run down other pretty women. That would show he had no taste, or make one suspect that he had too much. (…) If we ask him a question about anything, he should give us an answer all about ourselves. He should invariably praise us for whatever qualities he knows we haven't got. But he should be pitiless, quite pitiless, in reproaching us for the virtues that we have never dreamed of possessing. He should never believe that we know the use of useful things. That would be unforgiveable. But he should shower on us everything we don't want. - As far as I can see, he is to do nothing but pay bills and compliments. - He should persistently compromise us in public, and treat us with absolute respect when we are alone. And yet he should be always ready to have a perfectly terrible scene, whenever we want one, and to become miserable, absolutely miserable, at a moment's notice, and to overwhelm us with just reproaches in less than twenty minutes, and to be positively violent at the end of half an hour, and to leave us for ever at a quarter to eight, when we have to go and dress for dinner. And when, after that, one has seen him for really the last time, and he has refused to take back the little things he has given one, and promised never to communicate with one again, or to write one any foolish letters, he should be perfectly broken−hearted, and telegraph to one all day long, and send one little notes every half−hour by a private hansom, and dine quite alone at the club, so that every one should know how unhappy he was. And after a whole dreadful week, during which one has gone about everywhere with one's husband, just to show how absolutely lonely one was, he may be given a third last parting, in the evening, and then, if his conduct has been quite irreproachable, and one has behaved really badly to him, he should be allowed to admit that he has been entirely in the wrong, and when he has admitted that, it becomes a woman's duty to forgive, and one can do it all over again from the beginning, with variations.”“What is that dreadful girl talking about? - She is painfully natural, is she not?”“The English aristocracy supply us with our curiosities, Lady Caroline. They are sent over to us every summer, regularly, in the steamers, and propose to us the day after they land. As for ruins, we are trying to build up something that will last longer than brick or stone.” (American sense of superiority against the British, attacking even the English cultural heritage through Stonehenge)“examinations are of no value whatsoever. If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.”“talk to every woman as if you loved her and to every man as if he bored you”“You should never try to understand them. Women are pictures. Men are problems. If you want to know what a woman really means − which, by the way, is always a dangerous thing to do − look at her, don't listen to her. (…) to the philosopher, my dear Gerald, women represent the triumph of matter over mind − just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals. (…) The history of women is the history of the worst form of tyranny the world has ever known. The tyranny of the weak over the strong. It is the only tyranny that lasts.”the play is definitely entertaining and worth reading/listening to, or even watching, if ever found in a local theatre."
290,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5715619-richard-rogers,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a pretty entertaining play with a couple nuggets of truth well worth finding out, and it's filled with sayings that amuse but probably distract from what's at the heart of the play more than they add to it. IMO. But the play is more successful than not, especially if one is inclined to like Wilde, as I am, and would like to see it performed.But it seems like Wilde let loose with the aphorisms that look like they mean something but probably don't. I got tired of that. Lots of ""women do this and men do that,"" including the famous bit about women becoming like their mothers being their tragedy and men not becoming like their fathers being theirs. That's the best one. Among the rest, some draw blood; others are too by-the-numbers to feel like they truly say anything. Probably got laughs, I suppose.It takes a while to figure out who the play is about and what's happening with them. The story of Mrs. Arbuthnot and her adult son, who's being offered an amazing position with Lord Illingworth, emerges from a lot of random dialogue in the first act, where a number of guests at Hunstanton Chase are talking about nothing in particular. Much of it tends toward the behavior of men and women, but all with a jaded, insincere, ironic tone. Lady Hunstanton, explaining why a particular young lady didn't receive an offer of marriage from Lord Illingworth: ""But I believe he said her family was too large. Or was it her feet? I forget which."" That's funny, and shows how ridiculous marriage had become among the upper classes of England, but it's also pointless conversation. Later: ""Poor Lord Belton died three days [after eloping] of joy or gout. I forget which.""It's all just fodder for endless, pointless conversations, where the details hardly mattered. That's a critique of the institution, but the reader also begins to feel that nothing means anything; nothing they say is worth attending to. When asked about uneducated people voting, Lord Illingworth says he thinks they are the only people who should. Then he cautions against taking sides, because that ""is the beginning of sincerity, and earnestness follows shortly afterwards, and the human being becomes a bore."" Later he says that he adores simple pleasures, adding ""they are the last refuge of the complex."" Maybe that means something. I can imagine something deep there, but I got the feeling that even Wilde was just tossing out jokes, hoping they sounded significant. The whole conversation seems to be just setups for clever bon mots that don't really mean much, and I started to wonder if anything would happen in the story.But we find out that there are secrets and connections and a history between people, and the story does get interesting. It's all about how women get squashed by society for sexual impropriety, but men never have any consequences. It's disappointing that religion and strict morality are taken for granted here, and the prevailing perspective, as a result, is that men should suffer as much as women do, not that women should not. That feels like a missed opportunity, even considering the time of publication. However, you can read the ending as supporting that notion, of treating ""sinners"" (if you must) charitably, with forgiveness, especially since the least judgmental person in the play is the religious American woman who is often referred to as ""the Puritan,"" and she refuses at the end of the story to hold a woman's past against her.So maybe I should let that perspective get the final word on the topic.For too long, I thought we were supposed to see Illingworth as the lovable cad, like Rupert Everett's Lord Goring in An Ideal Husband. (I haven't read that play yet--it's just the movie for me so far.) Turns out--spoiler--Illingworth's just a cad. His wordplay is self-serving, not self-deprecating, and his apparent immorality is who he actually is. TBH, it all makes a lot more sense when you read the beginning the second time, supplied with backstories and true natures. I wonder if people went multiple times to the play back in the day...My favorite character, in the end, is the earnest and mocked young American woman. I don't know how she would have been received by Wilde's contemporaries, but she's just alright with me. Direct. Sincere. Forgiving. Good stuff.Lots of it is funny, and I like the story. Wilde can absolutely do ""clever."" Just a bit more heart early on and it would have really worked for me. Still, 4 stars--it comes close."

Çocukluk döneminde; Mutlu Prens, Bülbül ve Gül, Bencil Dev gibi çocuk hikayelerini okumuştum. Birkaç yıl öncede beraber okuma kitabı olarak “Dorian Gray’in Potresi”ni seçtik, okuduk ve üzerine sohbet ettik. Tek romanı olduğu için onu seçmiştik. Benim okuduğum “Önemsiz Bir Kadın” ise bir tiyatro oyunu. Wilde’ın en tanınmış oyunlarından biri. Wilde gibi bir dâhiyi tek kitapla bırakmak istemediğim için bu kitabını aldım, okudum.  İlk kez 1893 yılında sahnelenen satirik ( yergi türünde) oyun, yüksek tabakayı ve toplumun ikiyüzlülüğünü eleştiriyor. Türkiye’de ilk kez Nurettin Sevin çevirisi ile Milli Eğitim Basımevi tarafından 1948’de yayımlandı. Benim aldığım kitap İş Bankası Kültür Yayınları – Hasan Ali Yücel Klasikler Dizisinden.  Oyunda 15 karakter var ama 6 – 7 karakter öne çıkıyor. Yazar; fakirlik / zenginlik, evlilik / aşk, özgürlük / ahlak gibi karşıt görüşleri, sınıf farkları, kadın – erkek ilişkileri, kadının toplumdaki yeri gibi toplumsal konuları bu karakterlerin ağzından bizlere aktarıyor. Tabii eleştiren bir dille bunu yapıyor.  Sohbette Lady Stutfield: “Aah ah! Dünya erkekler için yaratılmış, kadınlar için değil.” Diyor. Oyunun yazılmasının üzerinden 128 yıl geçmesine rağmen sadece fikren değil uygulamada da bir değişiklik, gelişme yok. Hala cinsiyet ayrımcılığını aşamamış bir toplum olarak medeniyeti nasıl üst seviyeye taşıyacak, gelişeceğiz? Paylaşılamayan nedir? Nihayetinde hepimiz ölümlüyüz. Zaman ve enerjimizi cinsiyet savaşı yerine farklı uğraşılara yönlendirip daha uygar, daha refah yaşamak hakkımız değil mi?  Bir konuşmada Bayan Allonby: “İdeal Koca? Öyle bir şey olamaz. Zaten müessese yanlış.” Diyor. Nasıl teşhis? Hemen kırılmayın beyler, kuralları koyan, şiddet uygulayan sizin cinsiniz. Üstelik atalar ne demiş? “Koca insanı kocatır. İyi bir şey olsa ‘gonca’ derlerdi.”  Sohbet sırasında Lady Hunstanton: “Korkarım İngiltere’de çok fazla yapay sosyal engelimiz var. Alt ve orta sınıflarla gerektiği kadar temas etmiyoruz.” Demiş. O dönemde sadece 3 sınıf var: Asiller, orta sınıf ve alt sınıf. Gün��müzde ise yapılan son araştırmaya göre İngiltere’de 7 sosyal sınıf var: 1- Elitler 2- Prekarya (Prekarite ya da prekarya, 20. yüzyılda tanımlanmış bir çalışan sınıfı. Ağırlıklı olarak; sınırlı-kontratlı, yarı zamanlı, proje bazlı sözleşmeler ile işgücü piyasalarına iş yapan sınıf) 3-Yerleşik Orta Sınıf 4- Teknik Orta Sınıf 5- Yeni Zengin İşçiler 6-Geleneksel İşçi Sınıfı 7-Yükselişteki Servis İşçileri. Sınıf farkları ya da ayrımcılığı hoş değil tabii ki. Ama sosyal sınıf sayısının artması toplumun daha çok bölünmesi demek değil mi? Dikkat uçurumlar derinleşiyor… Lord Illingworth, Gerald ile konuşurken: “ Dünyadaki en muhteşem şeye sahip olduğunu unutma – gençsin! Gençlik gibisi yok. Orta yaşlılar hayata ipoteklidir. Yaşlılar hayatın tavan arasındadır. Ama gençler ‘Hayatın Efendisi’dir. Gençliği bekleyen bir krallık vardır.” Oscar Wilde diğer eseri “Dorian Gray’in Portresi”nde güzelliği öne çıkartmış, önemini vurgulamıştı. Bu oyununda da ‘gençliği’ öne çıkarıp, önemini vurguluyor.  Sohbet ederken Lady Hunstanton: “Ah! Biz kadınlar her şeyi affetmeliyiz, değil mi sevgili Bayan Arbuthnot.” Diye soruyor. Hep alttan alıp, affetmek kadına düşüyor. Kadın olarak kimleri affediyoruz? Baba, kardeş, evlat ve eş… Kan bağı olanların ve yasal bağı olanın affı farklı tabii. Ama fail hangisi olursa olsun, ne kabahat işlerse işlesin her af bir sonra işlenecek kabahat için zemin hazırlamıyor mu? He af yeni bir kabahat için teminat değil mi, emsal teşkil etmiyor mu? Okurken gene yeni şeyler öğrendim, bilgi dağarcığım genişledi. ❌Büyülü Fener: Projeksiyon cihazının ilk haline verilen ad. ❌Peerage: Birleşik Krallık soyluluk kayıtları. İlki 1826’da Londra’da hazırlanmış olan Buke’s Peerage, soy bilim ve arma bilim konusunda rehber haline gelmiştir. ❌Prekarite ya da prekarya, 20. yüzyılda tanımlanmış bir çalışan sınıfı.

292,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"Поціновувачам Уайльда, а особливо головного його твору — Портрета Доріана Грея, а особливо самого яскравого і неоднозначного його героя — до неможливого цинічного лорда Генрі, що сипле афоризмами і легко може майже кожному довести, що чорне — то біле, цей твір теж має сподобатися. Так як на сторінках цієї п'єси фактично присутній той же герой, правда з іншим ім'ям, але в тому ж амплуа - це лорд Іллінгворт. І він не просто сипле своїми фразами, що так сподобалися багатьом любителям Портрета, і що плутають чорне з білим, добре зі злим, а за одне й людей, що його слухають, але в п'єсу увійшли фактично повтори окремих фраз, хоч і з косметичними змінами. Ну, наприклад, фраза: «Для того, щоб повернути свою молодість, я готовий робити все — тільки не вставати рано, не займатися гімнастикою і не бути корисним членом суспільства».Звичайно, є й нові істини імені лорда Генрі-Іллінґворта: «Добре зав'язана краватка — це перший важливий крок у житті» — мені чомусь здається, що ця теза, не просто гарний вислів покликаний шокувати публіку, але справді виражає суть автора, можливо за цим лордом-спокусником і ховається внутрішнє ""Я"" автора? Тому автор уже заочно мені не милий, а будь ми знайомі в реальності — дуже сумніваюся, що змогли б зійтись характерами. Не мій це автор, скільки б ним не захоплювалися, порожній і шкідливий (особливо яскраво видно на його дитячих казках). Хоча наскільки б деякі визначні люди не були б злими й огидними — вони завжди мають натовпи шанувальників. Так і головний денді і гульвіса автора - Доріан Грей - кружляв голови і захоплював за собою молодих людей і дівчат, спокушав їх прикладом свого безтурботного, гріховного, але зовні такого блискучого світського життя, а потім без жалю кидав у бруді і мчав далі за новими жертвами, що не переставали ним захоплюватися, як метелики невтомно гинучи на полум'ї яскравої, але згубної свічки. - Отже так, для Доріана першим кроком краватка, але аж ніяк не занапащені ним душі.Якщо ж хтось під враженням фраз лорда і не поділяє думки про їхню згубність, все ж таки знаходить їх повними вишуканого розуму «не для всіх», то ось ще одна фраза, яка яскраво ілюструє всю їхню підсумкову порожність і нульову цінність, ця фраза дозволяє дати загальне уявлення про якість майже всієї балаканини лорда, що тут, що в Портреті, причому вислів обраний просто на вскидку і я не ставив за мету вибрати саме найяскравішу своєю порожнечею фразу: «Будь-яка думка аморальна. Її суть у руйнуванні. Коли ви думаєте про щось, ви це губите. Нічого не може перенести впливу думки». І як? А що ж це все ж таки має означати то? Чи це ще перекладач доносив свою лепту?Але є й різниця між цими двома творами. Якщо в Портреті багато читачів не могли однозначно визначити позитивний це герой чи негативний, то в «Жінці, не вартій уваги», він точно негативний. Хоча, написавши останню фразу, я чомусь перестав у ній бути так впевнений, і дивлячись на масу позитивних і захоплених відгуків по Доріану, починаю думати, що і тут можуть знайтися читачі, які зможуть визначити героя, що спокусив обіцянкою одруження молоду нерозумну дівчину, одурив її і незабаром кинув зганьблену з дитиною на руках, що жодного разу не поцікавився потім долею цієї жінки і свого сина, як позитивного, оскільки йому все виходить дуже яскраво і цинічно пояснити!А так, якщо спочатку цей твір — пустопорожня балаканина на черговому рауті, то в кінці — не ""найбагатша"" мелодрама. (Може автора впору зараховувати до одного з родоначальників мелодрам? 😉). Але, д��кілька сцен вийшли досить цікавими, розташування героїв за традиційністю шкали цінностей однозначніша за Портрет, так що і оцінку я навіть поставлю на бал вище. 7/10"
293,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7508838-sabeena,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wilde has not disappointed me once! He lives up to his hype. Is one of the most quotable plays I have ever read?? Probably! Quotations/dialogues that are 'fresh' and impactful; a welcome break from the platitudinous statements that we are bombarded with on social media these days!Lots of people have adorned their reviews with quotes and I myself noted many down. How darn right clever Wilde was!!!!His writing is playful and unpredictable. There are humorous lines but I wouldn't call this a comedy. I know many plays where comedy has been written in as specific characters or scenarios aside from the main plot and this shows variety and adeptness. All the writing Greats had this quality. Whether for shock value or not, it was thrilling to read the culturally non-formulaic/unobvious views of certain characters especially the arrogant Mrs Allonby in her after-dinner revelations to her all-female company.One such is example is when she revealed to them the following:'When Ernest and I were engaged, he swore to me positively on his knees that he had never loved any one before in the whole course of his life. Unfortunately however I made no inquiries of any kind till after I had been married four or five months. I found out then that what he had told me was perfectly true. And that sort of thing makes a man so absolutely uninteresting'Then...'I don't think the frivolity of the wife has anything to do with it. More marriages are ruined nowadays by the common sense of the husband than by anything else. How can a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating her as if she was a perfectly rational being?'And.... ' The ideal husband? There couldnt be such a thing. The institution is wrong'Published in 1894 I find it useful to put myself in the time and understand the climate - socially, politically etc to get the most out of the writing but this play is full of surprises. His characters make many insane characters of his counterparts' plays look like they were the sanest of people. And yet there is a moral plot. Even for that period, late 19th century, the ending sequence is still relevant today. A justice had been served and 'right' was done despite what the climate at that time had generally prescribed in terms of children out of wedlock etc. Wilde was well ahead of his time. Noone needs me to tell them that.Now for my favourite quotes!1. Hester: I dislike London dinner partiesMrs A: I adore them. The clever people never listen and the stupid people never talk.Hester: I think the stupid people talk a great deal.Mrs A: Ah, I never listen!2.Lord Illingworth: The soul is born old but grows young. That is the comedy of life.Mrs A: And the body is born young and grows old. That is life's tragedy.3.Lord Illingworth: Discontent is the first step in the progress of a man or a nation.4.Lord Illingworth: People nowadays are so absolutely superficial that they don't understand the philosophy of the superficial.5.Lord Illingworth: All thought is immoral. Its very essence is destruction. If you think of anything, you kill it. Nothing survives being thought of."
294,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/86626869-veronica-castagno,Rating 3 out of 5,"Esta obra de teatro de Oscar Wilde, estrenada en 1893, no es su mejor trabajo, sin embargo fiel a su costumbre el escritor plasma en ella una fuerte crítica a la clase alta, a la cual pertenecía pero despreciaba por encontrarla superficial y vana. De hecho, esta crítica se hace presente en la primera parte de la historia la cual trascurre en la casa de campo de Lady Hunstanton, en la que podemos apreciar como sus amigos ricos a los que ha invitado a una fiesta de jardín (además de mostrarse demasiado ociosos) invierten su tiempo en chimes de mal gusto incluso a través de personajes como Lady Coraline, Wilde, refleja la hipocresía y la doble moral de la sociedad de su tiempo. La historia es muy breve, tanto que sólo cuenta con dos escenarios. Los personajes pese a estar estereotipados cuentan con diálogos muy inteligentes, sobresalientes y por supuesto llenos de ingenio. Además, la crítica del escritor trasciende, ya que no sólo se enfoca en el comportamiento de la clase alta pues plantea problemas sociales, culturales, de género, económicos y por supuesto políticos, esto a través de Lord Illingworth, personaje que por su carga ideológica (además de su fino sarcasmo) podría atreverme a decir es el alter ego del escritor en Una Mujer Sin Importancia. El melodrama de Wilde pese a ser simple, en estructura, y caer de repente en la exageración, no choca por la época en la que fue concebida. Hay que entender que Wilde vivió en la época victoriana, cuando las mujeres tenían muy pocos derechos en comparación con los hombres, lo cual destaca en la segunda parte de la obra. Otro acierto dentro de la historia es, que pese a caerse de pronto, logra salir a flote para después mantener su ritmo gracias al trasfondo filosófico con el que cuenta y a un secreto que es develado en un momento cumbre. ******Citas destacadas. "" ¡Ah! El Mundo está hecho para los hombres, no para las mujeres"". "" ¡No diga eso! Nosotras estamos mucho mejor que ellos. Hay más cosas prohibidas para nosotras"".""Es enormemente monstruosa la costumbre que tiene la gente hoy en día de decir cosas contra los demás a espaldas suyas, que son absoluta y enteramente ciertas"". ""Excluyes a tu sociedad de lo amable y lo bueno. Te ríes de lo simple y puro.viviendo, como todos ustedes, en otro y por ellos, necesitan sacrificarse, y si les arrojas pan a los pobres, es meramente para mantenerlos callados por un tiempo "". ""Amas la belleza que puedes ver y tocar, la belleza que puedes destruir, pero de la belleza invisible de la vida, de la belleza intangible de una vida superior, no sabes nada "".""La felicidad de un hombre casado depende de las personas con las que no se ha casado"". ""Si un hombre y una mujer han pecado, que ambos salgan al desierto a amarse o aborrecerse allí. Deje que ambos sean marcados. Establezca una marca, si lo desea, en cada uno, pero no la castigues solamente a ella y permitas que él sea libere porque no existe una ley para hombres y otra para mujeres. """

In 4 short acts, and filled with quirky and smart satire, Oscar Wilde's 1894 release of one of the most famous plays and piece of writings gives us an inside look into Bristish aristocracy and their perception of social class, felial duty and of course America.Mr. Kelvil, Hester, Mrs. Arbuthnot, and Gerald were my favorite characters. That Lord Illingworth was an entitled, sexist baffoon to be completely honest with you. Hester's brutal and direct summation of the social construct of the British at the time really ruffled some feathers. It was brilliant!Lord I.'s dismissal of Mrs A. after a mutual affair which ended in Gerald, twenty something years prior. The way that he thought so little of her because she wasn't of a particular social class... Sigh... Im glad that she never married him and turned down her father-in-law 's offer of $600/year to take care of Gerald. That wasn't pride. That was know her self-worth which I loved!

296,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45259998-nina-the-fussy-reader,Rating 4 out of 5,"Oscar Wild's writing is pure wit and intelligence. He makes you laugh, he makes you think. He was a man so aware of how ludicrous upper-class society was and his mockery of its people is clear in his every satirical work. He isn't afraid to point out how superficial and idiotic the women are and has no qualms pointing out how arrogant and egotistical the men are.He has a very clever way of exposing high society life as being little more than low society in fancier clothes and big draughty halls.A Woman of No Importance isn't as light and comical as, say, The Importance of Being Ernest, though it has its moments, instead, it presents a harsher aspect of society, exhibiting how unjustly women were treated. If a man did wrong is was accepted simply as the usual and even fanciful behaviour of a man; a sort of 'boys will be boys' understanding. But if a woman does wrong she is condemned, disgraced and cast of from society life, forcing her to either accept her dishonourable fate or live a lie. This play highlights perfectly the condemnation of woman against woman, more so even than men. I almost got the sense that a man wouldn't particularly care about a woman's past or her lost virtues, but it is the women who are quick to judge whilst being uninformed on the matter altogether.I was very pleased with Mrs Arbuthnot's decision at the end regarding Lord Illingworth. After what he did and how callous he was with her feelings, he didn't deserve a moment of her time. It was great to see a woman from a play of Victorian times stand up for herself and tell the obnoxious man where to stick it. I was a little worried the play would end in romance (undeserved on Illingworth's part) but thankfully Wilde didn't write Mrs Arbuthnot as an insipid female ready to throw herself into the arms of a former lover, ignoring his past misdemeanours. A very satisfying ending indeed.The tension and drama in this play were delicious and the writing, of course, was masterful. I don't expect anything less from Wilde. I could see the comedic moments on a stage with Lady Caroline passing from room to room always looking for Sir John, and I imagine it would be very funny.I'd really like to see this performed live sometime as the wit of Oscar Wilde is truly something that needs to be experienced firsthand. The standout quotes to me were,""When a man is old enough to do wrong he should be old enough to do right also.""""Duty is what one expects from others, it is not what one does oneself.""""The only difference between the saint and the sinner is that every saint has a past and every sinner has a future."""

I don’t just mean characters expressing themselves in a similar fashion to Lord Henry - I mean Wilde literally copied and pasted entire sentences from his novel to his plays... “To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance”. He sure as hell did.This repetition (of sorts) is perhaps most obvious in “A Woman of no Importance” and “An Ideal Husband”.While this play is not as symbolic as “Salomé”, or as sophisticated as “The Importance of Being Earnest”, I did enjoy it more, because some of the themes really hit home. Without being overly sentimental or melodramatic, it manages to convey some real life issues that sadly remain relevant and common today. I will be reading it again for sure.——————————————”We are trying to build up life, Lady Hunstanton, on a better, truer, purer basis than life rests on here. This sounds strange to you all, no doubt.

Kişilere dayatılan ahlak kavramının kimin kurduğunu, kimin yön verdiğini, ahlak kavramının kişiden kişiye farklılık gösteren bir kelime olup olmadığını, kimlerin ahlaksız sıfatı ile nitelendirildiğini çok güzel bir şekilde sorgulatan bir eser.

Bu nedenle yapacağımız bir çok davranışta ilk önce onların ne düşüneceğini, neler söyleyeceklerini aklımıza getiririz ve o zaman yaşadığımız hayat bizim olmaz. Önemsiz Bir Kadın kitabı bu duruma örnek olarak gösterilebilecek kitaplardan bir tanesi.Yazarın görüşlerine katılmasanız bile ders çıkartabilirsiniz.

I started reading it because sometimes I just find myself wanting to read about a bunch of familiar characters speaking Oscar Wilde, but I did not expect for him to outdo himself like this. I loved the feminism and the gentle love in it. He really has so many Opinions about shame and double standards which are so lovely to read, and just wants love and good things for everybody who's decent (and his and society's views of decency are very, very different). He was such a sweet, dear moralist at heart and wasn't even bothering to disguise that with too many aphorisms here. I think I've found my favourite Oscar Wilde play.HESTER. If a man and woman have sinned, let them both go forth into the desert to love or loathe each other there. Let them both be branded.

A title and a line so mighty, so manipulative, and evokes the asleep consciousness of where to stand and what’s my right. Happened in a series of events over a short period from a house party of high-class society in the Victorian era, lashings of audacious absurdity, and gender manipulations from social satires that a modern person’s sanity will be tested if be read in today’s era.A start from the elite’s mockery of middle-class society to emphasize the gloriousness of the superiority of the upper class, slowly unraveling in each page the reeking smell of their hidden vices and mischief, making a point of how women should only be “plaything” and doesn’t deserve an intellect that can debate a man, and ending all these series of events in a short period by giving justice to an exposed concealed secret for twenty years which turns out that this particular man named Lord Illingworth who has always something big to say ended up in being a man of no importance to the thing that is most precious to him other than his wealth and title, his son.An abundance of impactful and debatable lines was overflowing in this book and I want to share with you some of the most compelling lines that I have read.🌷 “Life, Lady Stutfield, is simply a mauvais quart d’heure made up of exquisite moments.”🌷 “People now-a-days are so absolutely superficial that they don’t understand the philosophy of the superficial.”🌷 “The secret of life is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming.”🌷 “but position and money are not everything, are they?” “They are nothing; they bring misery.”🌷 “Hearts live by becoming wounded.

302,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1041468-jerry-smith,Rating 4 out of 5,"This play is somewhat more moralizing and biting that some of Wilde's works, in my opinion as is deals ably with the conventions and social mores of the time and their inherent hypocrisies. Of course, this is true of all his work but seems particularly the case here. That is not to say that the famous and wonderful whimsy and witty wordplays are not to the fore as well as they certainly are. However in ""The Importance of being Earnest"" the rogues in the play are likeable and their witticisms therefore seem more congruous than they do here, in the mouth of Lord Illingworth. This character is shameless and, although funny as most of Wilde's characters are, has few redeeming features and leaves at the curtain basically the same nasty character. This is actually refreshing as there is no happy ending here, but again, the whole seems a little discordant. That may be the point and one that I have missed. I love the writings of Oscar Wilde. The more one reads him the more one finds some of his witticisms to be written long similar lines, but they are laugh out loud funny and to quote the extremely pithy Monty Python sketch makes one think: ""I wish I had said that"". When you overlay this on top of his social satire and commentary, you have a genius indeed. I know he is widely admired but probably never enough in his later life. This is perhaps not a masterpiece but is a great play - reading it makes me desirous of a trip to see this performed live again where it, of course, really comes to life."

His mother objects to the moral character of his new employer, but can give no concrete reason without revealing her dark past. Gerald is determined to accept the post, because he is in love with a young American lady and needs the money to get married. Throughout the play, various rich and titled characters gossip about London high society, and flirt with each other, and say a lot of shameless nonsense.One of the main reasons why I love Oscar Wilde's hilarious plays is the silly dialogue. The characters say such idiotic things, and it always makes me laugh. Almost the entire first act is fluff and character introductions, but it is such entertaining fluff that I didn't mind. Of course, the social commentary is an undercurrent that lies under every scene, exposing the rich elite as vapid, immoral, and selfish.I really enjoyed the plot in this one, and the conflict that Gerald and his mother experience keeps the story moving forward. The last act gets more serious, and the drama is quite passionate.I was intrigued by the main characters, and appreciated the gradual unveiling of their personalities. I was imagining their dialogue in my head as I read it, wondering how they would say the lines, and what their expression and body language would be.

How people seem to get the idea that a fault of that kind is a woman’s fault and a punishment should be given always to the woman.But the woman although seemed in their society back then as a woman of no importance, gathering all her pain in life and refusing to marry the man who ruined her life once he asks for his advantage, out of his selfishness for wanting his child to be his. The woman is shown as a brave, caring, intelligent, independent mother, woman and simply as a person, she stands out from the rest and the thinking style back then. It is the last sentence “a man of no importance” who truly get you to realise how sophisticated is Wilde."

That's hard to grasp sometimes when reading his works, because unless you're reading diving deep into the context surrounding every play, you don't get it.

Since then, I have read some of his more prominent works, and he has never failed to make me chuckle and haw at random moments in reading.So imagine my surprise at tearing up at the end of this one. Where others of his plays end as light and fluffy as they began, with simple and positive messages such as forgiveness or enjoying life on a shallower scale, this story felt very emotional in contrast. The monologues on dealing with shame make me wonder if they came from Wilde's own heart, and don't fall far from the exact same issues we deal with today. I don't know much about Wilde's personal story besides his jail time for homosexuality, but I do wonder if the burden of living with his societal and religious shame came through in this play. Additionally, the optimistic, idealistic, and often misguided American character serves as hope here. She offers the chance at freedom, of change, of possibility, in comparison to the stagnant structures of English society. I really enjoyed this. My only dislikes, such as not knowing the characters for 3/4 of the play, are probably due to the injustice of reading and not watching it, which I hope to do anyway sometime this week.I'll make sure to bring tissues with me~"

Wilde's dandy's can easily utter things like: “To win back my youth, there is nothing I wouldn't do - except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member of the community.”or:“My dear young lady, there was a great deal of truth; I dare say, in what you said, and you looked very pretty while you said it, which is much more important.” Without any consequences whatsoever. But in this play, there are consequences, and the burdens fall plainly on the women, who have to suffer when the men go of scot-free. It is a quite feminist, harsh satire of Victorian England. It pierces all the ingenuity, dishonesty and casual, albeit funny, sexism, and even if it does so with more than a touch of the dramatic and old-fashioned, it is still quite refreshing to hear a 19th century character tell a high and mighty lord that she does not find his marriage proposal as generous as he thinks it is, but would rather say alone."

His points of view and quotes are unmatched and equipped with a terrible moral that is timeless and refreshing . A Woman of No Importance does much to really put Wilde’s points of view in sheer brilliance. It reads like his essays but with a satirical edge and tough criticism of the 19th century. I particularly loved the fluidity of the play and the uncomplicated settings . The character portraits were economical and the dramatis was fairly easy to follow . Lord Illingworth will give you a think and Lady Caroline a hearty laugh whilst Hester Worster serves as the reflection to society’s ills . Probably one of his best plays and a very worthy read. There are so many ways to view this play . It can be a feminist, critical , social commentary on class etc . I can’t to re read it and visit it with new lenses.Favorite quotes : “Men always want to be a woman's first love. That is their clumsy vanity. We women have a more subtle instinct about things.

While the plot does not really pick up until near the end of the second act (although if you enjoy Wilde’s witticism and social commentary like I do, you’ll still thoroughly enjoy the first act), once it starts, it is phenomenal. Wilde’s criticism of society’s double standard for men and women, especially in regards to extramarital sex (although he manages to touch on a wide variety of topics dealing with women during this time period), is absolutely amazing. I especially enjoyed Act 4. The mother’s character is just so raw and tormented, it’s impossible not to ache for her (I thought her story was very similar to Fantine’s from Les Miserables, both in plot and emotional impact). And Lord Illingworth is so horribly despicable—very similar to Lord Henry from The Picture of Dorian Gray—I hated him completely. I definitely enjoyed this play as much as The Importance of Being Earnest. While it had none of that play’s side-splitting hilarity, it was much more impactful. Whether or not you’re a Wilde fan, I would definitely recommend this play. (Side note: Many of the themes reminded me of Henrik Ibsen’s “A Doll’s House.” They share many similarities in how they address the topic of unfair treatment towards women.) "

In my opinion, I found the main and most important characters (Hestor, Mrs. Arbuthnot, Gerald, Mr. Illingworth... especially Illingworth) to be kind of pathetic in parts. This took away a bit of likeability from Hestor, Mrs. Arbuthnot and Gerald but not too much so that I disliked them.Some of the dialogue is long-winded and sometimes the plot frustrates me but was a pretty good read in the end.""Hallo, mother, whose glove is this?

In my opinion, I found the main and most important characters (Hestor, Mrs. Arbuthnot, Gerald, Mr. Illingworth... especially Illingworth) to be kind of pathetic in parts. This took away a bit of likeability from Hestor, Mrs. Arbuthnot and Gerald but not too much so that I disliked them.Some of the dialogue is long-winded and sometimes the plot frustrates me but was a pretty good read in the end.""Hallo, mother, whose glove is this? You have had a visitor, who was it?""""Oh! no one. No one in particular. A man of no importance""."

I couldn't agree more.It is always wonderful to read Oscar Wilde's works, stands true to the thoughts and conversation we have in this century. I guess nothing really changed.The pep talk from Lord Illingworth to Gerald draws parallel to the chat between Henry Wotton and Dorian Gray. I found their conversations quite similar when they talked of youth in particular. The other characters found Lord Illingworth to be of an immoral nature, he knew how to talk, influence people and he said that a man who can rule over London's dinner table can rule the word. The same can be described about Lord Henry Wotton.The one character that amused me so much, was the wife of Dr. Daubeny. She was not physically present, but is a topic of conversation between the Doctor and Mrs Hunstanton. The excuses he gives of his wife's ill health, which leaves her incapable of attending social gatherings makes me suspicious. She could be someone who doesn't prefer crowd, or despises Mrs Hunstanton in particular. We will never know."

I would go on but fear I may get emotional.One should never trust a woman who tells one her real age. A woman who would tell one that would tell one anything.Men always want to be a woman's first love. That is their clumsy vanity. We women have a more subtle instinct about things. What we want is to be a man's last romance.He should never run down other pretty women. That would show he has no taste, or make one suspect that he has too much.Men marry because they are tired; women because they are curious. Both are disappointed.When good Americans die they go to Paris....And when bad Americans die, ...they go to America.We have the largest country in the world, Lady Caroline. They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as big as France and England put together.Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.What do you think she'd do if I kissed her?Either marry you, or strike you across the face with her glove. What would you do if she struck you across the face with her glove?Fall in love with her, probably."

He's certainly a very quotable writer! I can't help but think that more attention has been given to the prose than to the story, however - and it does seem a bit lumpen, that story. Perhaps it's because the romance in it is only a secondary thing, between two secondary characters? For the most part it's a straight drama that centres on the confrontation of Lord Illingham with the woman who, twenty years ago, he'd seduced and abandoned. Much of the play is concerned with the differing standards that men and women are held to under such circumstances: she is ruined, while he is allowed back into decent society, even if he is the more at fault. I'm completely with Wilde on this, and I suspect with a very good actress Mrs. Arbuthnot would be enormously affecting - she's affecting even when only reading the play - but I read Lady Windermere's Fan a couple of days ago, also by Wilde, and when it comes to portraits of so-called fallen women, Mrs. Erlynne leaves Mrs. Arbuthnot for dead.

I am so very, very glad to have read this play (pun intended). The character dynamics, relationships and interactions were executed perfectly and I loved the subliminal girl-power messaging as it's so ahead of its time. It was so amusing how Lady Caroline treats Sir John as her personal servant 🤣 And I'm seriously shipping Lord Illingworth and Mrs Allonby, their convos were just on point and filled with intellectual banter. These 2 convos were my faves:“LORD ILLINGWORTH What do you think she'd do if I kissed her?MRS ALLONBY Either marry you, or strike you across the face with her glove. What would you do if she struck you across the face with her glove?LORD ILLINGWORTH Fall in love with her, probably.”“MRS ALLONBY You have your looking-glass.LORD ILLINGWORTH It is unkind. I merely shows me my wrinkles.MRS ALLONBY Mine is better behaved. It never tells me the truth.LORD ILLINGWORTH Then it is in love with you.”"

It could also be because I've read so many Wilde plays in a row, who's to say! There's a lot of what feels like padding in this book, especially in terms of Illingworth's many senseless dialogues, though some were hilarious and witty, making points about the senselessness of European society during this period and politics. There were a number of scenes I appreciated, including the very end, Hester's speech, but the book lagged on lengthy dialogue that went nowhere. The dialogue between Illingworth and Gerald's mother was especially strong, with her accusations. On the other hand, the first scene by the tree felt especially pointless, setting up the decadent lifestyle of these rich people and their attitudes towards marriage but not even mentioning the scandal that comes out in scene two. There are also a few too many characters, some of which play very small roles. Overall, this has some great witticisms, but I don't think I'd have read it if not for this project, though the last scene almost made it all worth it. "

Sometimes when I was reading the last few books, I was feeling bogged down with the details in between conversations so a play - with only dialogue - was exactly what I needed. Sometimes old fashioned humor is no longer found funny today, and maybe this isn't as funny now as it was back then, but I still liked the jokes. I could see how it would be amusing to see on stage. I think Wilde is clever, with his choice of words and the course of action. I really didn't know what he would do with the ending and I could see it turning in completely opposite ways and working out well. I really enjoy reading old fashioned works that focus on society because of how much these things have changed; I find society such a crazy thing back then! This play has an American visitor at the English country dinner party and several women have great speeches about what they want in relationships and in a man, all ridiculous notions and humorous ideas. I was really entertained. :)"

The first two acts first and then, months later, the last two acts (I just looked it up, this may have actually been the case! I feel smart). The first two acts are the dullest I have read from Wilde. There were too many characters and, even though they had slightly different and distinguishable characteristics, it wasn't enough for me so as to not go back to the character sheet and remember who they were. The conversations were vapid (and I understand that it was on purpose), but did they really need to extend over two acts and let the great majority of the conflict happen and be resolved in the last acts? It certainly didn't help that there was a huge gap between me reading the first and last two acts, but I feel that this came about from me losing interest because of this very reason. The drama REALLY escalated after (I loved it though) and then the final act came in with unexpected compassion from what I would have expected from a play in 1893.TL;DR: Loved the ending, hated everything else."
322,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61305011-jackie,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is a more serious play compared to ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" with a more dramatic conflict. The play still has Wilde's colorful commentary on English society through his witty dialogue, but with a dark secret at the root of the conflict. There is also an examination of the different moral values between men, women, and Americans compared to the British. We are introduced to an American woman, Hester Worsley, visiting England who does not understand the values of the British upper class and they do not understand her. The play also examines marriage and why some people marry. Is it for the right or the wrong reasons? The other two main protagonists in the play were sympathetic and I felt such strong hatred for the male character who you could say is antagonist. The play is short like ""The Importance of Being Earnest"", though it has one more Act than that one did and as I said, this play has a bit more drama."

Even though at this point, I’m pretty aware that classics are as relevant as ever, I’m still always surprised when I find their relatability. You start reading this play by reading it out in your awful British accent and end up not putting it down till you’ve read the last act and the last impactful line. The interactions between the women, the staunch differences in the characteristics of Mrs Allonby and Hester, it all ties in so well with the conversations I still have with my friends. The guilt and shame felt by Mrs. Arbuthnot and the almost frat boyish character of Lord Illingworth still holds true with so many contemporary relationships you see today. This has drama, humour and a very, very clear understanding of the shame that women have to go through and the infamy that men gain from it. "

The humor of the material does not relent, and I was laughing out loud throughout the course of the play. Only near the end of the play does the plot resolution begin to cut into the humor of the story.

The push and pull of antithesis sends the focus of conversation bouncing wildly from the shifts in the text. "

La frivolidad de la época se queda de lado, para tratar el tema de la diferencia entre hombres y mujeres,sobre todo, cuando hay hijos sin haber matrimonio. Pone en el escenario a la madre soltera, al hijo sin apellido y al hombre impune (un completo respetable sinvergüenza)Óscar Wilde logra establecer su punto de vista sobre la sociedad rancia en la que vivió, y se atreve a compararla con la sociedad americana, a través de las ideas de un único personaje, una mujer.Wilde nunca deja de sorprenderme, y ahora lo hace con un final feliz muy lejos del “y vivieron felices para siempre”.

That is their tragedy. No man does. That is his.”“Talk to every woman as if you loved her, and to every man as if he bored you”“No man has any real success in this world unless he has got a women to back him, and women rule society.”“All women have to fight with death to keep their children. Death, being childless, wants our children from us.”And i have to say i giggled everytime Lady Hunstanton forgot something or kelvins name. "
328,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I believe I mentioned in my review of ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" that it had a great last line. It seems that this was a specialty of Oscar Wilde, as many of his plays wrap up with a very satisfying bon mot. Often it even incorporates the title of the play. Of all of these ending lines, though, I would rate the one for ""A Woman of No Importance"" as the best. It perfectly encapsulates the theme and message of the play.With the exception of ""Salome,"" which stands alone in its style and setting, all of the work I've read by Oscar Wilde takes place among the English upper class. The action mostly takes place in drawing rooms of country estates and the like. ""A Woman of No Importance"" was interesting in that it has an American character who offers a strong contrast with the society around her. There were also some quite funny scenes, more reminiscent of ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" than ""Lady Windermere's Fan."" But overall the tone of the play was fairly serious. The main impetus of the drama is a man who had seduced a young woman of lower status, only to abandon her (the ""woman of no importance"" of the title) when she was pregnant. Now, unbeknownst to him, he has agreed to take on their son as his personal secretary. The play presents the woman and her plight most sympathetically, which may have seemed radical for the late nineteenth century. But it had an air of sentimentality that made the play seem more dated to me. Nonetheless I think anyone who has enjoyed Wilde's other work will enjoy this play."
