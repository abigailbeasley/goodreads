(sometimes all at the same time)! Fredrik Beckman, author of ""A Man Called Ove"", does it again... manages not only to write a unique-charming-heartwarming novel....but he has created extraordinary memorable characters, 'AGAIN'!!! Elsa is the greatest combinations of both her parents, and grandparents, but mostly she is unique and different. Precocious, and lovable! Grandmother is eccentric, a little nutty, a superhero.....both a sword and a shield. She is strong independent woman, who wants to say ""I am sorry"" to those she loves. Trolls, dragons, kingdoms, magical treasures, Harry Potter, ice cream, cookies, beer, cinnamon buns, cloud animals, Star Wars, and more.....The fairytales add to the enjoyment and depths of issues of the heart!  The issues at heart are family bonds, Family history, reflections of the past, life lessons, love, forgiveness, acceptance, laughter. While reading this AMAZING GEM of a story...I often reflected back on my grandma Cookie! After my dad died -when I was 4yrs old- (her son, Max, was only 34), ...she and I became exceptionally close. She died when I was 7. I may have only had those 3 special years with Granda Cookie.. but they were some of my best childhood memories. After my first daughter was born... she, too, felt as though she knew her great- grandmother through stories I shared with her. Later-- she wrote a paper about her -great grandmother- from our family history. I was touched beyond words. This book is for ALL AGES!! I was so incredibly grateful to receive this book from the publisher, and Netgalley, because...I was hoping I could save myself some money. However, the opposite has happened. I need to buy at least 3 copies, (physical books), to give as gifts. The first person I can't wait to share this book with is my oldest daughter. She's going to go nuts over it. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND reading this!!!! I also suggest that if you are a grandparent...Ask your grand child how much they know about you. Encourage them to ask questions about your personal life, so that they too can be future storytellers and keep memories alive. Fairytales are not just for children!"
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2265296-suzanne-ross,Rating 2 out of 5,"This one didn't work for me. Too much story telling within the story. I found myself getting irritated with all of the names of the places in the Land of Almost Asleep. I appreciated the viewpoint of our precocious little protagonist at times, but most often found it frustrating. She could be so insightful about certain things, yet so obtuse in that we seemed to miss big chunks of the greater picture (or at least, I did). All of this sleeping in wardrobes and popping out to visit faraway lands left me thinking along the lines of 'The Lion, Witch and Wardrobe.' I guess I was hoping for another sweet read having just come off 'Ove', but this was not to be. There's much more I could say here, but why go on? There are more books to read!"
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m,Rating 4 out of 5,"4+ StarsAt the heart of the story is a seven year old girl without friends, an outsider in her school who is loved deeply by her cantankerous , seventy-seven year old grandmother. I was taken by Elsa and her grandmother from the very beginning. It's the story of the beautiful legacy that a grandmother leaves her granddaughter. Granny may seem crazy but she is such a very loving grandmother to Elsa that the things she does while they seem crazy , can be so easily forgiven by the reader once her story unfolds and you see what a good person and really a humanitarian she is . Granny does all she can to help Elsa through a hard time . Her parents are divorced and her mother and new partner are expecting a baby but worst of all Elsa is having a rough time at school . She has no friends and is constantly bullied. Granny gives this lonely little girl the gift of love and friendship and teaches her to cope by giving her a fairytale world in the Land-of-Almost -Awake. It captivated me at first but then I couldn't keep up with the details of the characters and the rules of this complex kingdom. But at some point I understood better who these characters were and just went with the flow because what is divulged about Granny's past will make you love her in spite of everything . There is a cast of characters living in the same apartment house and at first you think you know who they are , but then their complex stories and connections are told as the story progresses . The author has cleverly , actually very creatively, woven their stories together and we learn that they have more in common than the same address . Their stories will break your heart . I have to admit at times , I was not into the fairytale but once I got what the stories were really about , I saw it in a different light .The precocious Elsa is definitely beyond her years but it was hard at times to believe that a 7 year old would be as wise and knowing about people as she was . She's so smart and astute that you sometimes forget she's only seven until we see the insecurities and vulnerabilities of a seven year old dealing with her parents' divorce, confronting grief and death and her anxiety over having a half brother or sister and fear that she won't be loved as much .This may not be for everyone but if you loved A Man Called Ove , although a different story , you will find the same humanity here with imperfections, vulnerabilities and triumphs of spirit . This is about a little girl and fairytale but this is definitely a book for grownup kids . Thank you Atria (Simon & Schuster) and Edelweiss."
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew,Rating 3 out of 5,"I almost didn't give this book a star rating at all. As I listened to it I couldn't really figure out if I like it or not. It has shades of books I cannot stand and shades of books I love. In the end, I couldn't bring myself to leave the star rating blank, but I am not sure you can trust my experience to match the experience you might have.I have loved the other Backman books I have read: A Man Called Ove and Beartown. Because of this I went into this with high expectations. While this has some similarities to A Man Called Ove, it is definitely a very different book. While Ove is a fairly straightforward story, this one ventured back and forth from reality to make believe that I found a little bit hard to stay interested in.I mention make believe, and at times this book ventures into the realm of magical realism. Usually my experience with magical realism is a positive one, but I did not care for it much here. I think the reason might be that it frequently reminded me of Gaiman's The Ocean at the End of the Lane, which I didn't care for at all. So, if you are a fan of that book, you may enjoy this one, too.I did like all the different characters and exploring all of their personalities. I think this is the biggest thing that carried over from Backman's other stories. Each person is a side story unto themselves and it is fun watching their tales all get woven together.In the end, I cannot say for sure if I recommend this one or not. If you liked other Backman books, don't go in expecting the same. If you are a fan of fairy tales, you might like it. If you don't like odd stories that stray a bit from reality, this is not the book for you."
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie,Rating 4 out of 5,"My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She’s Sorry by Fredrick Backman is a 2015 Atria publication. I read “Britt-Marie was Here” a while back and really liked it. It was suggested to me several times that I should go back and read this book because Brit-Marie is a secondary character here and this book is a segue into BMWH. I am glad I was gently nudged to read this book and I couldn’t have chosen a better time to read this one. After having read several books in a row with melancholy themes, this book brightened my mood significantly. That is not to say this book is fluffy, because it’s not. There are plenty poignant and emotional moments expertly woven into this humorous and whimsical story which features a precocious seven -year old girl named Elsa. Every seven -year old deserves a superhero. For Elsa that is her seventy-seven year old grandmother who regales her with stories that become like a secret communication between them. Her grandmother always comes to defense, is always in her corner, something Elsa desperately needs because she is a little different. This, of course, sets her up for a great deal of bullying at school, and causes her mother a good deal of exasperation at times. But, when her grandmother dies, Elsa is left to cope with her parent’s divorce, her mother’s pregnancy, and her issues at school without her staunch supporter. Elsa is not only sad, but is also angry that her grandmother has abandoned her. But, via a series of apology letters her grandmother wrote to various people she felt she had wronged, Elsa is sent on an adventurous journey that will enlighten her, challenge her perception of her beloved grandmother, and change the dynamics of her relationship with her mother and other family members, opening a door towards forgiveness and acceptance. Elsa stole my heart, as was intended. I enjoy seeing children portrayed as trailblazers in a way, because they refuse to give in to conformity. Elsa doesn’t do this as an intentional rebellion, though. She is who she is and her ‘crazy grandmother’ encourages her. Elsa’s love of Wikipedia is hilarious at times, but it’s her fondness for Harry Potter books that was so telling. That she related to those characters, is a testament to how stories and books can offer relief and comfort, as well as influence and teach. While the characters are quirky and eccentric, the story has a slightly sinister undertone, because Elsa is afraid of ‘The monster’ which is more than just a part of her imagination and fairytales. But overall this is a story of family and its complexities and mysteries, the regrets and mistakes, and triumphs and sacrifices made over the course of a lifetime, atonement, understanding, forgiveness, and embracing individuality. I was thoroughly entertained by this novel, and enjoyed experiencing the wealth of and range of emotions and it evoked. This is a delightful story, full of charm and hope!! "

I listened to the audio from the library instead of reading my books as I'm trying to beat the clock. Hopefully I will come back around to all the books I'm reading at this time and do them justice!!Absolutely loved it! Happy Reading!! Mel 🖤🐾🐺

I don't think I've ever read a book that had me feeling so many emotions AT ONE TIME. There were times I was LMAO with tears rolling down my face.

8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte,Rating 5 out of 5,"Children's characters, such as Pippi Longstocking, and Sophie of 
Sophie's World by Jostein Gaarder
, comes to mind, reading this book. Seven-year-old Elsa was a good combination of the two. Wild, naive, and philosophical. Precocious, brattish and different. Elsa knew very well what grown-ups meant when they described her as  'very grown-up for her age'. What they actually meant was 'she is massively annoying for her age', which they directed at her parents with strained smiles spread all over their faces. They treated her as though she was mentally impaired. All she did was correct their spelling, or something similar. What was so wrong with that, I beg you? She was not as thick as other seven-year-olds. Her extraordinary intelligence counted against her. Her parents were divorced. They were both living in new blended families. Her mother was pregnant again with Halfie (half-sister or brother); George, the step-dad, could prepare eggs and jog, and loved wearing his jogging shorts over his leggings; Her dad lost touch with reality along time ago when he fell in love with fonts. The chances of him delivering any graphic designs on time is zero. The choice of fonts prevented him from finishing anything. Otherwise, he found happiness with Lizette and her two young children. Elsa felt threatened by the new baby, and lost in her dad's new life. Her grandmother was a dysfunctional superhero in Elsa's world. A retired, 77-year-old doctor, who triggered the smoke-alarms at the airports with her smoking in the ladie's room with an open door; was asked to retire after refusing to stop smoking in the operating theater; spilled Fanta on Elsa's iPhone and tried to dry it out in the toaster; climb fences at the zoo in the middle of the night; threw policemen with turds; traveled all over the world to save lives when everyone else was rushing to get out and away from dire war situations.Creating fairy tale-metaphors for little Elsa, was her grandmother's way of teaching the hard realities of life in story form to the little girl without friends. Nobody understood this bright child, not even the teachers and headmaster at school, where she was constantly bullied. Her busy parents did not know what was happening to her. Granny knew, and taught Elsa how to handle it through the fairy tales. Elsa learnt to run. Run very fast. She learnt to observe everything. She learnt to read and write properly. Grandma expected of her to read books to her while grandma drove her ancient rusting Renault around town, without a driver's license. Grandma could not spell. Almost-eight-year-old Elsa constantly had to correct granny's writing for her! Elsa started correcting everyone's writing. Even the notices at restaurants. She had Granny, Harry Potter, Wikipedia and Google at her disposal to get what she wanted. The words she did not understand, was added to her dad's word jar. Elsa was born on boxing day. Her story was a Christmas Story. And this tale, ""My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry"", was also going to be one. ... 'Storytelling is the noblest profession of all. The currency there is imagination; instead of buying something with coins you buy it with a good story. Libraries aren’t known as libraries but as ‘banks’ and every fairy tale is worth a fortune.'That was what grandma believed. Who was Elsa to disagree. 
""A normal story can either be funny or sad or exciting or scary or dramatic or sentimental, but a Christmas tale has to be all those things. “A Christmas tale has to be written with every pen you own,” Granny used to say. And they have to have happy endings, which is something that Elsa has decided completely on her own.""
 Granny's fairy tales from Miamas was fairly dramatic as a rule. Wars and storms an pursuits and intrigues and stuff, because that was the sort of action stories that Granny liked. Grandma created different kingdoms in the Land-of-Almost-Awake:
Miploris. That’s where all the sorrow is stored. It means “I mourn.”“And Mirevas?”“I dream.”“And Miaudacas?”“I dare.”“And Mimovas?”“Dance. I dance.”“Mibatalos—I fight.""
But the unimaginable happened just before Christmas. Grandma died of cancer. Elsa lost her only friend. What was it about death that was so devastating?
""The mightiest power of death is not that it can make people die, but that it can make the people left behind want to stop living""…
 However, grandma taught Elsa that life does not really end with the passing of a beloved. 
""You never say good-bye in the Land-of-Almost-Awake. You just say “See you later.” It’s important to people in the Land-of-Almost-Awake that it should be this way, because they believe that nothing really ever completely dies. It just turns into a story, undergoes a little shift in grammar, changes tense from “now” to “then.”
She left a set of letters behind which would merged Elsa's two worlds. She would be introduced to the real people who were characters in the fairy tales, and who would open up a big world of possibilities to the seven-year-old heartbroken little girl. All the people living in their big old building had a story to tell, relationships to explain, history to be completed, and a communal love for her grandma to be celebrated. The treasure hunt unleashed in the letters, would bring closure to everyone mentioned or addressed in the letters. They were cranky, quirky, mysterious, dysfunctional or simply strange. As each letter is delivered, more color, as well as a mysterious danger, is added to this Christmas tale. Britt-Marie, one of the busybody neighbors who would have been a perfect murder victim in a Inspector Poirot murder mystery, had everyone up in arms with her nosy interference. But when she received her letter from grandma, she had an important lesson to teach to Elsa. 
……We want to be loved,’ ” quotes Britt-Marie. “‘Failing that, admired; failing that, feared; failing that, hated and despised. At all costs we want to stir up some sort of feeling in others. The soul abhors a vacuum. At all costs it longs for contact.’ ” .... ""I want someone to remember I existed. I want someone to know I was here.”
Grandma's letters turned the building and its inhabitants upside down. Life was changed for all of them.I was bowled over when I discovered, after finishing the book, that it was written by the author of 
A Man Called Ove
. Yes, I know I was a bit dimwitted. But just remember, it is every single person's undeniable right to make a fool of him/herself, and I am exercising that right by admitting this here! By saying this I admit being in total cohorts with Grandma in the story. I not only liked her; I recognized her as a soulmate! Apart from that, the surprise was wonderful.  A Man Called Ove was one of my all-time favorite books, still is. This book, with a quirky, lovable, eccentric, unique cast of characters; its cheeky sense of humor; social commentary and tongue in cheek approach to the absurdities of 'Society', combined with fairy tales in the Harry Potter zeitgeist, kept me cemented to the plot and pathos of an extraordinary as well as entertaining story, written by a highly talented author. If you loved Ove, you might love shrewd, intelligent, wise, cranky, funny as hell Grandma too. You will recognize the humor and daring thoughts at play.VERY IMPORTANT: You do need a sense of humor and a huge imagination to let this book work for you. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. "

10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108612357-larry,Rating 4 out of 5,"It’s no secret I’m a huge fan of Backman, and this book doesn’t disappoint. Typical mix of humor and sadness, flawed humans who find joy in an imperfect world and each other. For me, it hits close to home, as the main character, Elsa, reminds me of our girls, including the loss of my Mom at a young age. In her eyes, they hung the moon, and were capable of anything. And, if I could ask her today, she’d still say the same."
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1076079-karen,Rating 2 out of 5,"This was a tough one to bear after loving Ove sooooo much. Sure, I liked Elsa well enough, 7 going on 8, and Granny was pretty amazing, but the constant reverting to fairytale land made this such a disappointment for me, I was ready to ditch it several times. There was a story to be told but with too many distractions; too many things to NOT like along the way. On the audio, read with a nice British accent, I couldn't be sure of any spellings (or obviously of my hearing); so please bear with me here while I complain. And upfront I tell you who loved this book that I am sorry. Because I did not.The Kingdom of Miamas I swear sounded to me like Myalis, which sounds like a prescription drug for erectile dysfunction in my non-fantasy world. The animal which I guess was just a big dog but never called a dog sounded like it was called a Worse or Worser (reminding me of Wrong and Wronger ala Alec Baldwin). After digging around some, I find it was Wurse and Wurses, but I don't think that's an actual word. This dog/Wurse was constantly being fed chocolate, which is actually quite dangerous for our furry friends and should not be encouraged. Very dangerous. Little Elsa, 7 going on 8, was more like 7 going on 17. Much too smart and worldly for 7 going on 8, no matter how much she used Wikipedia.There were many little similarities with Ove's story, but copying from a previous success does not another success make. I think this should have been marketed to kids around 7 going on 8, so it would never have crossed my path. But then looking at everyone else's ratings, there's something definitely wrong with me and most likely my hearing.2.5 stars"
12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26175098-christine,Rating 5 out of 5,"I am probably the last Goodreads member to read a Fredrik Backman novel. I read two of his novellas, one of which I really liked and one that I didn’t. This novel, on the other hand, deserves lots and lots of love. When I first got into this book, I connected quickly with Granny and almost 8-year-old Elsa. However, I was not at all keen about the fantasy arc. I figured no matter how good the rest of the book was, the fantasy aspect was going to be worth at least 2 negative stars. Since my cribbage/domino buddy lent it to me with eager anticipation of my opinion, I decided to carry on. Good thing I did because now I am excited to have four more Backman novels to look forward to.Elsa is “different.” So is Granny (a major understatement). The book has been dinged by several reviewers as being unrealistic. Well, yeah, maybe, but sometimes that little sore point can be overlooked—like with this book. And I have to say, once it became clear the fantasy part plays a major role in understanding the whole meaning of Elsa’s journey, I decided to change my crappy attitude and go all in. By that point I even thought it might be possible for the tale to wring 4 stars out of me. The plot is unique and really quite profound. Elsa is sent on a “treasure hunt” by her grandmother that requires Elsa to meet everyone in their apartment building. There are specific reasons for Granny to do this. The task is not easy for Elsa, but it turns out to be seriously rewarding. The characters are diverse, very sympathetic, and memorable. I love these books about elderly people and their effect on young children who are “different.” Another thing—this story is quirky and is unlike any I have read before. Major points for that.I am not going to say anything else about the plot or the characters as this one is best going in cold if at all possible. I wouldn’t even read the blurb if you haven’t already. Let the story come to you. Props to the artist of the cover and to whoever came up with the title—both are perfect.Several major themes are touched upon, including: it’s okay to be different; first impressions aren’t always accurate; your elders can teach you a lot; not all dreams should be discounted; young children often have the same fears and insecurities as adults; direct communication and understanding are vital; family does not have to share bloodlines.This is a heartfelt and profoundly touching novel. By the time I finished the epilogue, I had tears in my eyes, I was missing Elsa and Granny something fierce, and this book had earned all the stars and a spot on my list of top ten reads of 2019. "
13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34622220-seemita,Rating 4 out of 5,"[Originally appeared here (with edits): http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/li...]Ah! What have I read here? A delightful take on life? A sensitive take on grief? A wise take on relationships? Perhaps all of it. And more.At the centre of this book, is an almost-eight-years old, Elsa. When her best (and quirky) friend, her grandmother, leaves her a series of letters upon her death to be delivered to their intended receivers, she sets onto a thrilling journey of discoveries. What was the primary purpose of the letters you ask? You guessed it. To say sorry.Among Elsa's neighbours are eccentric chatterboxes and drunken workaholics, weird hounds and mysterious lurkers. Her mother is her punch-bag over teen issues (if Elsa can be called a teen that is) and her Dad is her word collector who can stand everything except a grammatically incorrect sentence. Well, mostly.Wading through this motley hoard of people, Elsa embarks on a voyage of her own, fumbling on realities at every step and growing wiser with every revelation. Reading quality literature like the Harry Potter series comes handy. And so does listening to (and reminiscing) Granny's fairy tales. After all, she is the Knight in the Land-of-Almost-Awake!Backman’s heart-warming army conquered me in no time. He possesses a deceptively easy style of narration but one is taken aback by the substance he packs in his one-liners. 
Never mess with someone who has more spare time than you do.

Its strange how close love and fear live to each other.
 It appears as if Backman leaned on many a poles and watched people battle their demons in routine life - just how some transformed into the fiercest warriors under chaotic spells but were sorely defeated by the toothless, simple, predictable plateau of life. And why everyone, irrespective of their positions on the axis of life, needed attention. 
We want to be loved; failing that, admired; failing that, feared; failing that, hated and despised. At all costs, we want to stir up some sort of feeling in others. Our soul abhors a vacuum.
 The strength of Backman's narrative rests on his seamless switching between hilarity and sombreness, keeping the sensibilities of his characters away from dilution. So when a child and a war soldier look at the same issue and engage in a long discussion, their respective identities and backgrounds stand beside them like faithful sentries. That both can still reach a common ground is the beauty of this book.This work is a magnificent ode to humanity and the many virtues that guard it from losing its sheen. It's a subtle but strong call to dream, to imagine, to protect, to persevere, to sing, to dance, to fly, to fall yet to stand, to encourage, to fight for the right cause, to love, to forgive; in other words, 
to live.
 Nothing is a shame, even believing in superheroes, if it eventually adds up to the good in this world."
14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may,Rating 2 out of 5,"I may write a full review at a later date, but this book just didn't contain the magic that A Man Called Ove had. It is narrated from the perspective of a seven year-old girl who is precocious to the point of being unbelievable. Backman's talent lies in creating witty, cynical, elderly characters, which he should stick to because there really are so few books centred around older men and women. However, after Elsa's grandmother dies (near the beginning), the book quickly lost its sparkle."

It really made me miss my crazy granny, god rest her soul."
16,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma,Rating 2 out of 5,"Remember how I read this book? Because I sure don’t.What stands out in my mind is that I was able to finish this book when I was finishing literally zero books. But like...don’t let that make you think it was easy. It was Not. Every page I read was a gargantuan effort. Most of this got done by me literally spending one (1) entire evening reading this book. And I only did it because I told someone I was going to be spending my night reading, and that made me feel pressured to do so.I do not hate this book. Neither do I love it, or like it a whole lot. Or even like it a little bit. It just...exists.I get what it was going for. And it’s admirable. It’s supposed to be all imagination-y, and isn’t-childhood-cool, and family is important and let’s all love each other and smile.But it was mostly just really boring. All the characters were bland. And sometimes it went too far on the imagination front. And on the redeeming-characters front. (Not everybody is awesome, okay?!)Also, this little girl (the main character) is a haaaaaater. (That’s literally a reference to a specific episode of a specific podcast I listened to today. In unrelated news, I am the biggest loser on the entire earth.) Like, every kid is a sh*tbag in her mind. I JUST DON’T LIKE THAT. If you’re going to redeem a weird, semi-neglectful grandmother and a guy who is literally called the Monster, maybe there can be a kid or two who doesn’t full-on suck?But hey. What do I know.Plus I normally really like reading Scandinavian-translated books (I am the worst) because I like the way it sounds when it’s English-ized. It still holds a nice poetic effect. But I didn’t get that from this? Maybe because the little-girl-main-character speaks English a lot. Dunno. Didn’t like it.I have really pressed the boundaries of how much I can talk about this book, so…Bottom line: It’s okay. Whatever. Read it if you feel like it? Who cares about anything. -----------------I FINISHED A BOOOOOOOOOK!!!!and it was...good? it was fine.we'll talk about it.review to come"
17,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5858699-kavita,Rating 1 out of 5,"I read Backman's first book, A Man Called Ove, and found it a short and delightful read. My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry  only has slight glimpses of what Backman is capable. It certainly lacks the charm of his first book.There is a large cast of characters, each with their own stories and each drawn very sharply, and most important, each is weird in their own specific manner. Elsa, the protagonist, is a seven year old child, who behaves like a 17 year old frustrated teen. She is 'special' and hence gets bullied at school and has no friends. Her grandmother is her only friend but she dies of cancer, leaving Elsa to get on with a treasure hunt, which would lead her to uncover the stories of the weirdos living in the building. In parallel, we get stories from The Land of Almost Awake, a fantasy creation of Elsa's grandmother to draw her away from her tough life and keep her entertained. It is here that I completely lost interest. The fairy tale stories simply dragged on and on and were not interesting in the least. Elsa discovers that the fairy tales ultimately tied up to the stories of the other characters in the book, but this doesn't make them any more readable. I just skimmed through entire pages and have no clue what was going on in the make-believe land. Elsa herself is slightly annoying. She is supposed to be very bright for her age, but really, some of the things she does and says is simply annoying. She screams at people and constantly corrects them, which annoyed the heck out of me. And no matter how smart you think your child is, you don't allow her to drive a car! That was just weird. What kind of irresponsible people are these? Granny was even more annoying and really shouldn't have been looking after a child. Can I reiterate I hate child narrators / protagonists? Another thing that put me off the book was 'the boy with the syndrome'. Yes, that was his full name and he was constantly referred to as such continuously. I consider this unacceptable! The actual story emerging from this mess was quite interesting and had scope, but I had to plod through pages and pages of inconsequential and annoying fairy tales and precocious kids to get to the point."

In A Man Called Ove the main character was in his fifties and acted like a man of 85. In this book the main character is seven and acts as if she is 17. However if I ignore that I did enjoy the story and found it to be a light, entertaining read, not quite as interesting as Ove, but still okay."
19,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365405-james,Rating 3 out of 5,"I am usually good at knowing my ability to read a book in a genre other than ones I normally read. I'm not much of a fantasy or science-fiction guy. I loved Harry Potter, The Time Machine, Lord of the Rings, and Thursday Next, but when there's a lot of room for wiggle in the structure, I'm less inclined to like it. It could be an amazing book, but it just doesn't work for me as I question the boundaries and the influx of species I don't understand. I never expected to find that in a Fredrik Backman novel... I read four of his others and just went on a splurge to order copies of everything he'd written. When I perused the description for My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry, I went ""uh oh"" but continued on. About ten percent in, I knew I was going to struggle.It's not a fantasy book, but at least 50% of the story is based on metaphors and allegories where Backman tells us about the relationships of a kooky cast of characters who share residence in a large building full of apartments. Elsa is the 7-turning-8-year-old main character who's been given a series of notes from her recently deceased and supposedly crazy grandmother. Through Elsa's eyes, and her grandmother's imagination, we learn some history and some current happenings that tie everything together. Her grandmother created a fantasy world of people and places to help teach Elsa a different way of looking at the world both near and afar. In many aspects, the story is hilarious and adorable. When it sticks to real-life situations, I laugh and cry. When it tries to show the theory of how people relate to one another thru made-up places and monsters, I'm lost. It's a bit of an immediate thing.... I hear/see the words about another creature or planet, and something sinks inside me. In movies, I love it. But in books, I usually do not. I also struggled at times because of the simplicity in some of the writing. While Elsa's vocabulary is quite skillful, and her ways of dealing with people are more mature than most adults I know, the short and terse structure at times overwhelmed the plot for me.So... my lesson is to be careful when going on a binge to read all the works from an author you love. While this hasn't caused me to drop my opinion of Backman, it made me realize a story needs to work on all levels and elements to truly move or impact me. In this one, the fantasy took me out of the normal love I have for Backman's style and character development to the point I found myself skimming way too often. I committed to reading it, and I did, but I probably only digested about 2/3 of the content because it just wasn't keeping my attention.I'm still gonna read more of his work and recommend him to others. Just not this book unless the reader is unlike me and loves the fantasy components. Given the good parts were a 5 for me, and the bad parts were a 1 for me, I settled on allotting 3 stars which in my world is still a good book. I recognize the skill and talent enough to say it's a solid read with a select audience. Kudos to anyone who loved it, I wish I could be more open-minded in some of the genres I don't often find interesting. Maybe one day!"

22,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51395417-brian,Rating 4 out of 5,"“I want someone to know I was here.”This is the second Fredrik Backman novel I have read. I will read others I am sure. “My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She’s Sorry” is a sentimental tale, with a 7 (almost 8) year old protagonist whose sardonic voice is a real joy to read.The novel suffers from a slow start. There is a fairy tale device that is interweaved into the narrative that never fully grabbed me, and it took me most of the book to buy into it. Other readers I know jumped right into that aspect of the text. To each his own, right? However, the last half of the book I thought was strong narratively, things started to fall into place for me with the fairy tale device, and from that point on I was fully in.The author uses redundancies to excellent effect in this book. The redundancies alternate between being humorous and reinforcing thematic textual points, and sometimes they do both at the same time. They were well executed, and using redundancy without being annoying is a nice hat trick that Backman pulls off in fine manner. As mentioned previously, the child protagonist Elsa is also an engaging character to read, as Backman infuses her with observations well out of a 7 year old grasp while still writing her as a believable child.“My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She’s Sorry” is a sentimental and beautiful story. A cynic would call it trite, and perhaps it is trite, but this line from the text kind of makes my point for me, “Stories were completely for real, and at the same time not.” That encapsulates this book in a nutshell. This novel may be simple, but it is beautiful and profound more often than not, and for those reasons alone (not to mention a story that is clever and engaging and writing that is good) should make it worth your time to read.

A man called Ove was a stronger story for me. I am looking forward to Bear Town, which seems like a great one....

But little by little I was drawn into both the fairy tale and the real worlds in this book, full as they are of grief, loss and sorrow, powered by Backman's prose that is wry, comic, ironic, sarcastic, occasionally ridiculous and full of heart. ""Having a grandmother is like having an army"", says Elsa, and her late grandmother is quite amazing, leaving upon her death a treasure hunt made of fairy tales for Elsa. The end is breathtaking and far more rewarding than I expected. I laughed, I cried. It's Backman's M.O. to disarm the reader with charm and comedy and steal your heart in plain sight. And in the end, after all, Backman forced me to ask myself what is wrong with shameless sentimentality when it's this well done? Not a thing. The real world lately cries out for escape and this is a wonderful book to follow down the rabbit hole."

Bullied at school, Granny is Elsa's best and only friend, her guide to the Land-of-Almost-Awake, a dreamscape of fairy tales, magic and adventure that comforts them both when life is difficult, and her very own superhero.She shouldn't take any notice of what those muppets think, says Granny. Because all the best people are different - look at superheroes.""Just before Granny dies she presses an envelope into Elsa's hand, and asks her granddaughter to deliver a letter.""Give the letter to him who's waiting. He won't want to accept it, but tell him it's from me. Tell him your granny sends her regards and says she's sorry""And so begins Elsa's adventure, part quest, part treasure hunt, part superhero mission, Granny's letter leads Elsa first to the door of a wurse, and then The Monster (also known as Wolfheart), another letter leads her to the Sea-Witch and yet another much later to the Princess of Miploris. With each letter, offering apologies and regrets, Elsa unravels the truth about the fairy tales that form the foundation of the Land-of-Almost-Awake, and the secrets of her grandmother's exceptional life.""Elsa doesn’t know if this means that Granny took all her stories from the real world and placed them in Miamas, or if the stories from Miamas became so real that the creatures came across to the real world. But the Land-of-Almost-Awake and her house are obviously merging.""In My Grandmother Asked me to Tell You She's Sorry, Backman weaves a creative tapestry of the ordinary together with the extraordinary. Characters that are real, flawed yet magnificent, or as Granny puts it, ""no one is entirely a sh*t and almost no one is entirely not a sh*t"".

And probably both would be right. Because life is both complicated and simple. Which is why there are cookies.”― Fredrik Backman, My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry I really loved this book! I was inclined to like it because Britt-Marie Was Here left such an impression, but I honestly can't say now which of the two books I liked better! Backman is definitely an author I will keep my eye on. My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry is a tremendously imaginative, touching, clever story, that I already know will be among my favorites this year. The plot is difficult to summarize without making it sound simplistic. There is a dose of almost everything I look for in a book: beautiful language, humor, a few tears (okay, quite a few) a little magic, friendship, adventure, love. The setting of this novel is a fairly small one, but it heightens the sense of community and friendship, and it makes the characters question what it means to be a family in a traditional sense and a more abstract one. Through the eyes of a child, family doesn't have to be a blood relation, and a best friend doesn't have to be their own age, what matters is kindness, an affinity and the willingness to listen and be supportive. Backman does something in this novel, which can often backfire. He tells the story through the view of a seven-year-old girl, Elsa. She is definitely wise beyond her years, but he doesn't overdo it. It takes a talented author to write a novel for adults, dealing with very adult themes, through the eyes of a child, and I very much commend Backman for his skill and thoughtfulness. I grew so attached to the inventive, personable cast of characters, I feel a bit at a loss now that their story has come to an end. I wish I hadn't read Britt-Marie Was Here yet, so I could have that to look forward to, alas that is not the case.

But then I learn it’s about a precocious Swedish girl at seven going on eight and some kind of fairy-tale quest guided by letters from her grandmother. I start to put up resistance and read along with a chip in my shoulder. Not to worry. We don’t wallow in cuteness here, and there are a series of real life mysteries to keep you on your toes. Young Elsa makes a perfect team with her grandmother to put the adult world in its place. Granny takes care of her all the times her mother is gone running a hospital’s finances. Granny is anti-social and hates any kind of rules or pretense, which often gets her in trouble. Such as the time they snuck out to the zoo at night and were caught by the police climbing over the fence. She helps Elsa fight back when she is bullied at school and helps her see through and deflate all the shenanigans the adults in their apartment building are up to. Together they make up stories to put a better spin on the world. Eventually, they have a world of five kingdoms in the Land-of-Almost-Awake, each with a special logic and sphere for heroic action. Somehow this imaginary haven is more relevant the tales of the X-Men or Harry Potter which she thrives on. When her grandmother is no longer around, Elsa gets tapped to deliver a series of letters to various people in her building, and she is compelled to find out the secrets behind why there is a message of apology to all of them. There are surprising connections to the fairy tales invented for each of the kingdoms.As a little tantalizer, the kingdom of Miamas is founded on storytelling, one of which deals with snow angels who sacrificed themselves saving the kingdom from a giant tidal wave. Elsa has heard her birth came at a time of the massive tsunami which killed many thousands in the Pacific, and she is surprised to learn Granny’s work as a surgeon involved service to people in such trouble spots.  There is quite a system Granny has invented for the relationships between kingdoms: the dream hunters from Mirevas, the sorrow-keepers from Miploris, the musicians from Mimovas, and the warriors of Mibatalos. As Elsa’s quest verges between comic and dangerous, Elsa gets some help from a big dog she has to hide, a giant man of few words she calls Wolfheart, and a taxi driver who may know more about the secrets than he will reveal. In the end my doubts about this tale were finally left behind and I was glad for the imaginative adventure and amazing mix of humor, human truth, and redemption of damaged souls.

“It's strange how close love and fear live to each other.” 
This book didn't quite meet my expectations, and I think it's because the lines between fantasy and reality in the story got a bit blurry. Elsa's Granny was such a fun and charming character, sharing these enchanting stories set in a place called the Land of Almost Awake. The names of those places were really peculiar and unique! But as i kept reading, i started to realize that these stories were actually inspired by Granny's own life experiences.As the book progressed, you realized that those stories were actually based on Granny's own life, which is pretty cool. When Granny passed away, Elsa went on a treasure hunt to find all the people from Granny's past, and it turns out they were living in her apartment building. That part of the story must have been really interesting, getting to know these characters and how they were connected to Granny and each other.────────please make me ugly cry🙏🏽"

I really disliked this book. The absolute only redeeming quality that I felt it had was the cross over of characters from his other books. Luckily I had already read ""A Man Called Ove"" and ""Britt-Marie"". I felt that there was way too much time and too many pages put into the fairy tales. A bit of back story was needed, but I was tired of the non-stop fairly tale descriptions long before Granny died. I finished this book, but it took all I had to continue to pick it back up. Had I not involved this book in a couple challenges I would have gladly tossed it aside. This being his second book I would have thought it to be better, having enjoyed his first and third books. Too much nonsensical idiotic fantasy descriptions for my liking. I could not even disguise this stuff as magical realism. Definitely not my cup of tea. "
36,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3639005-candi,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was such an endearing story about a savvy and witty almost-eight-year-old girl (who seems to be going on forty-something!) and her hilarious but prickly grandmother! Fredrik Backman has written a very imaginative book with a cast full of very eccentric and interesting characters. Elsa lives with her mother and step-dad; the anticipated arrival of the yet-unborn sibling ""Halfie"" worries Elsa who feels she will be forgotten. These three live in a building shared with such occupants as Elsa’s grandmother, affectionately called Granny, as well as a number of others including a ""Monster"", a dog, and a drunk. I just loved Granny’s spunk! Elsa describes her perfectly: ""Granny isn’t particularly good at living in the real world. There are too many rules. She cheats when she plays Monopoly and drives Renault in the bus lane and steals those yellow carrier bags from IKEA and won’t stand behind the line when she’s at the conveyor belt at the airport. And when she goes to the bathroom she leaves the door open. But she does tell the very best fairy tales ever, and for that Elsa can forgive quite a few character defects."" In fact, the book is full of these fairy tales into ""The-Land-of-Almost-Awake"" cooked up by Granny herself. She shares these stories with Elsa when the going gets tough, or when Elsa needs some extra help going to sleep. Because Elsa is different, she is bullied and left as a friendless little girl at school. Granny is her hero and always stands up for her. When Granny shared her stories, I was initially confused. Little by little I was able to piece together what was going on with these little tales. ""Granny said that the best stories are never completely realistic and never entirely made-up. That was what Granny meant when she called certain things reality-challenged.""When Granny dies, Elsa is confused and heartbroken. Of course, the always perceptive Granny understood that her passing would be very difficult for Elsa. So, before she dies, she leaves a series of letters of apology to all those she felt she had offended or hurt in some way and leaves Elsa with the task of delivering these letters. Once she takes on this journey, Elsa learns about Granny’s life, connections between the people in her world, true friendship, and how to deal with grief and death. I loved learning about those left to protect Elsa and how they all rallied around her during her time of need. Elsa learns to understand the true meaning of Granny’s fairy tales – lucky for me because as Elsa learned, so did I! There were lots of wonderful messages to be learned in this book – from the priceless wisecracking of Granny: ""Granny said the real trick of life was that almost no one is entirely a shit and almost no one is entirely not a shit. The hard part of life is keeping as much on the not-a-shit side as one can"" to the realization that ""Sorrow and loss are constant, but if we all had to go through our whole lives carrying them the whole time, we wouldn’t be able to stand it. The sadness would paralyze us. So in the end we just pack it into bags and find somewhere to leave it.""I rated this book 4 stars. Unfortunately, my less than imaginative mind struggled a while with the fairy tales until everything came together for me through Elsa’s gradual understanding. Otherwise, I loved the book! I highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys an original story with a good touch of humor, tenderness and charm. Thanks to Atria Books for providing me with a copy to read and review through a Goodreads giveaway."
37,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54464244-hamad,Rating 3 out of 5," This review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found @The Book Prescription “Having a grandmother is like having an army. This is a grandchild’s ultimate privilege: knowing that someone is on your side, always, whatever the details. Even when you are wrong. Especially then, in fact. A grandmother is both a sword and a shield.”🌟 This concludes my journey of reading all Mr. Backman’s books this year and it has been a wild ride. I actually kept this for the last because I thought it would be my favorite but unfortunately it wasn’t.🌟 Backman is a great author when it comes to elderly quirky characters and judging from his more recent works he expanded that to writing books that include the whole community such as (Beartown and Us against you) which were my favorites. I also read his short stories and sadly didn’t enjoy them, I said it before and I repeat it; Backman is a great contemporary author but he should keep into that and not venture into fantasy.🌟 His writing is just so relatable, so close to my heart and I easily gets into his stories. His stories are realistic and emotional and delivers the whole bunch. That’s why I am saying that I don’t like the fantasy parts, He uses a lot of metaphors and comparisons between the fantasy world (That Elsa and Her Grandma shares) and the real world to send a message but he did it in his other works without this and it was better.🌟 I like the characters that he portrays, they are always memorable, I liked that Britt Marie was in this book too and we get glimpses into her past. All the characters were lovely in their own way but I had a problem with Elsa who was too precocious, I think she should have been at least 10 years old. I don’t usually care about ages in stories because most characters are precocious but Elsa seemed like a prodigy and wasn’t convincing for me.🌟 Summary: This is a good book -It is written by Backman after all- which has great writing and unique characters as usual. There was a mix between a fantasy story and a real one, I expected a more emotional read but didn’t get that. This was Backman’s second book after his widely successful “A Man Called Ove” so it must have been hard, I like that he develops a more distinct voice as he writes and this was part of his journey.“Only different people change the world,” Granny used to say. “No one normal has ever changed a crapping thing.”"
38,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29919991-catherine-alternativelytitledbooks--very-behind-again,Rating 3 out of 5,"After adoring Anxious People and A Man Called Ove, I NEVER thought I’d rate a Backman book this way.However, this one had a few flaws I couldn’t get over. Namely, our MC, a seven year old named Elsa was not only unbelievable as a character, but just didn’t feel too likable. Her obsession with X-men, Spider-Man, and Harry Potter was supposed to give her a childlike side, but her inner monologue and interactions with the world read more like a mix between an odd teenager and a reflective yet ornery old woman. Also? Backman killed off the character I actually wanted to hear from most at almost the beginning of the book. I also kept looking at the word ‘wurse’ as if it were a misprint every time, so that was hard to ignore, even though that wasn’t the case.Granny’s land of make believe was meant to be enchanting, but after the first 6 chapters or so, fell so flat for me. His trademark wit and insight shone during different passages, but overall this was a long read that didn’t give me the emotional impact I was hoping to find and I sincerely hope my next Backman book will be back on track!3.5 ⭐️, rounded down from 4"

40,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is a wonderfully unclassifiable novel that is first and foremost CHARMING.But if I was to classify it... or rather just list a bunch of things it is or has... I'd say it's about stories within stories, a quirky weird reverse-telling of Red Riding Hood, it's a popular culture nostalgiafest for things like superheroes and Harry Potter and even a bit of Star Wars, it's about death and loss and family and having a personality bigger than life and also making the best of everything that comes your way and believing that there ARE real superheroes in the world and they might be everywhere you look if only you open the door and get to know them.And that's kinda the point. The book is full of tons of great characters. Sometimes they annoy the hell out of you but more often than not, after UNDERSTANDING them, it's hard to keep hating them. Or keep yourself from that begrudging love that you know you love to hate because it's JUST NOT FAIR that these people can turn around and surprise you by not being complete jerks.I'm trying to say this is a good book. Despite, or perhaps because, it throws everything it is into this big pile and still charms us into believing it ALL MEANS SOMETHING. :)"

Everything played back as if I was reliving or watching a movie. All that bullying at school that I thought I had forgotten. All those mean kids that I left behind in Brazil... My worst nightmares were during Carnival time. How I hated Carnival week! I was terrified of leaving home during those days. It was hell for me.Anyways... the topic here is this book.What an amazing heartfelt work!This author really has an amazing talent for telling stories that are all about being human. Family and friendship are two of his most favourite topics, or so that’s what I assume.He is absolutely incredible. There is so much heart between the lines.I just can’t praise him enough.His translator is awesome and should deserve some credits, because to translate emotions is not an easy task. The storyline was gripping, entertaining and very well developed.There are some elements of fantasy that may turn some readers off, but trust me, there is a good reason for that. One of the reviewers here on Goodreads suggested to look at that fantasy part as being a metaphor and I think it is a great perspective (thanks Jonathan K! Also known as the hummingbird).I dreamt having a grandmother like that. And that very precocious little girl absolutely stole my heart.I’m becoming obsessed with this author and I cannot expect anything less from him.If you loved “A Man Called Ove”, then you may be surprised by this one, as I was.I will tie this book with my other two favourite books by Backman: Beartown & Us Against You (if you have not read it yet, do it - and watch the TV adaptation!)."

47,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3642045-sue,Rating 4 out of 5,"What a remarkable book. A combination of fantasy and brutal reality, pretend worlds and very everyday now. A 7 (about to turn 8) year old girl and her eccentric (to put it mildly) grandmother, live by their own rules while their mother/daughter holds a responsible, uninteresting job at the local hospital. Grandmother enlists Elsa in her antics and Elsa is a willing henchman while Granny helps to offset the bullying Elsa experiences regularly at school.Granny has created a world through stories, a world that is both complex and simple, the Land-of-Almost-Awake. This land has it's own structure, myths, heroes and villains and offers some rules that can help in Elsa's world. She has also set Elsa with a project, to deliver messages to people in Granny's life. And she has provided Elsa with guardians and warriors. What the ultimate story is, what the ultimate task is all about, you must read to find out.And I do strongly recommend that you read this. It was one of the most enjoyable reading experiences I've had this year. It offers a story which centers on a child without being childish; it has elements of fantasy while ultimately being grounded in this world. And it has some wonderfully complex characters.A copy of this book was provided by the publisher through NetGalley in return for an honest review."

I absolutely loved this story, narrated by Elsa, a quite precocious seven-year-old who has just lost her grandmother and is tasked to deliver letters to various people that contain apologies. Along the way, Elsa learns about these strange people and realizes that life is not as cut-and-dried as it seems on the surface.I think that readers either connect with Backman's writing or they don't, and I will count myself among those who definitely do. He has beautiful insights throughout his writing that bring tears to my eyes--both of happiness and a bit of wistful sadness. I feel like the author just ""gets"" people and humanity: even though we're full of selfishness, betrayal, anger, and spite, there is often goodness hiding behind the hurt. I'm now moving on to Britt-Marie Was Here (as soon as it comes in on Libby). "

52,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,Rating 4 out of 5,"Thank you to the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy of My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry. A high 4 stars. This book was written by the same author who wrote A Man Called Ove, which I loved. Backman's first book crept up on me unexpectedly. Reading My Grandmother was a similar experience with the added challenge of high expectations. At first, I thought ""ok, this is good, it has funny parts and a quirky central character, but it's a bit messy and I'm having trouble figuring out how this all fits together -- and I'm not loving it as much as Ove."" But by the end, I was fully immersed in the story, with a steady stream of tears rolling down my cheeks, interrupted by an occasional smile and nods of appreciation. Although it's a third person narrative, the story is told from the perspective of almost 8 year old Elsa who describes herself as ""different"" --which means that she does not have any friends and that she is unusually insightful and articulate. Elsa is very close to her Granny, who would easily be described as an eccentric tough old broad and who has been telling Elsa an ongoing fairy tale that permeates Elsa's understanding of the world and the novel. At the beginning of the book, Granny dies and a message is transmitted to Elsa charging her with the task of delivering letters of apology from her Granny to various people. This leads Elsa to learn about her grandmother's past and the people who live in her building and how they are all connected to each other. Her journey is sweet and sad; this ends up being a complex story, full of great insightful passages and quirky characters. There are many themes running throughout -- but it may be best summed up by Granny when she explains to Elsa that no one is completely shitty and no one is completely unshifty (I paraphrase but it certainly includes the words ""shitty"" and ""unshitty"" -- which my auto correct won't let me type very easily). One warning: if you choose to read My Grandmother, be prepared to suspend disbelief -- Elsa is far more insightful than any girl her age could possibly be. But if you can suspend disbelief, it's well worth the read. And if you haven't yet read A Man Called Ove, read it first. It will get you used to Backman's sensibility and it's a tad bit better. But if you loved A Man Called Ove, you will definitely enjoy this book."

Sure I liked Elsa well enough and Granny was pretty amazing too but the constant reverting to fairytale land made this such a disappointment for me. I almost ditched it a few times. Protecting a child from harsh reality with fantasy could be a beautiful story. I felt that the delivery of this concept was confusing and overbearing. I struggled with the first third of the book. I couldn’t quite figure out where the story was leading. Once it dawned on me the meaning of the make-believe worlds that were constantly referenced, I started to enjoy the story more. I can see why many people gave this book raving reviews. My heart broke that Elsa was bullied and that Granny was her only friend. When Granny dies Elsa is sent on a special mission to deliver letters to her various neighbors. Letters of apology from Granny. Elsa now gets to know her neighbors and the special connection that Granny had with all of them. I found unraveling this mystery to be the best part of this novel. I thoroughly enjoy the characters that Backman creates and I look forward to reading Britt-Marie Was Here as it is written in the same vein as a Man Called Ove."

You'd quickly run out of people if you had to disqualify all those who have at some point been real shits. Elsa, almost 8, p315.My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry is the story of the relationship between Elsa, almost 8, a precocious child with comic yet compassionate insight into the adult world, and her feisty, cantankerous grandmother, a retired surgeon who adores her. However, Elsa's perceptiveness and intelligence make her different, and she becomes the target of bullying in school. Her grandmother, her only friend, protects her by fuelling her imagination with fantastical tales of imaginary kingdoms.When her grandmother dies of cancer, at Christmas time before her 8th birthday, Elsa responds with grief and anger. Her grandmother has left her with a ""mission"" of delivering letters of apology to people she feels she has wronged or offended in their apartment building. The "" mission, "" framed as a treasure hunt, is understood by Elsa through the lens of the fantasy world her grandmother created. She tackles it as an adventure. However, these letters allow Elsa to fully appreciate her grandmother's life and connect more deeply with her parents and the community's quirky yet loveable tenants. This novel is my fourth by Backman. Although I found it hard to get into at first, it has become my favorite thus far. Perhaps this is because of its whimsical nature. It is almost like Roald Dahl for adults. I enjoyed the inventive interplay of the fantasy world with everyday life. In addition, Backman's humanity, his ability to portray characters who at times live on the margins with deep compassion and humor, provides an added dimension to the story."

(1)Precocious Elsa's superhero and best friend is her grandmother. Granny is an outspoken, humorous retired doctor who breaks the rules but has a heart of gold. To help Elsa deal with her fears and insecurities, eccentric Granny shares fairy tales that transport them to the Land-of-Almost-Awake with its many kingdoms and a secret portal. When Granny succumbs to cancer she leaves letters of apology for Elsa to deliver to the residents of their apartment building. As Elsa gets to know the backstories of the apartment dwellers she realizes that the fairy tales were based on real people's lives. An affectionate creature who loves cookies, a wurse (which resembles a Newfoundland), adds to the magic. But there is also a large man (the dragon) that might endanger the lives of her neighbors in the apartment (the castle).I loved the humor and the warm grandchild-grandmother relationship in this book. I found my attention wandering occasionally when the story went off for pages into the Land-of-Almost-Awake. The reader does have to suspend disbelief, even in the world of reality, but everyone can identify with the emotions that Elsa feels. It's best just to go with the flow, and enjoy the wisdom and the craziness in this heartwarming story."

Aquela história que até contribui, que até nos moldou, que até delineou a vida que queríamos ter, a vida desejaríamos viver (nem que não fosse por breves momentos)! Esta é uma história que nos permite reviver esse tempos, essa dias.Este livro explica porque contamos histórias aos mais pequenos! Fala-nos da honestidade das crianças e da “obtusidade” de muitos adultos, fala-nos dos desajustados, dos justos e dos injustos.Uma menina diferente. Uma menina de sete anos (quase oito), inteligente, astuta, adoravelmente sarcástica, observadora, extremamente clarividente e que adora pesquisar na Wikipédia. Uma, vá lá, nos dias de hoje considerada uma “nerd”. E, como tudo que é diferente, incomoda quem se acha normal, Elsa frequentemente tem problemas com os seus pares, na escola, sendo por vezes perseguida e intimidada. Elsa gosta de super heróis. Gosta de se vestir de homem-aranha e com frequência refere-se às qualidades do Harry Potter.A avó, com setenta e sete anos é o seu pilar. Também ela diferente, socialmente. A avó é aquela personagem que se “borrifa” para o que os outros pensam, para as regras sociais. Uma dupla improvável, com uma relação de amor profunda, terna e, sem dúvida, eterna.A minha sorte é que “um homem não chora”, pois caso contrário a coisa complicava-se!Após o falecimento da avó, Elsa fica encarregue de uma caça ao tesouro (missão estipulada pela sua avó) e assim, por intermédio de entrega de cartas, pedir desculpa, em nome da sua avó, a uma série de personagens. E assim, Elsa, fica a conhecer os relacionamentos complicados que a cercam e passa a ver, com toda a clareza, a mais profunda das verdades. É um processo, póstumo, de cura!Um maravilhoso conto de fadas, na/da vida real, sobre a inspiração, o poder de cura das histórias.Contado do ponto de vista, da perspetiva da Elsa, cujas observações são hilariantes. Hilariantemente sinceras e perspicazes. Um variado elenco de personagens, entre familiares, vizinhos e outros, mas todas elas facilmente reconhecidas, memorizáveis, autênticas! A fantasia e a realidade, confundem-se, mesmo até bem perto do fim, onde a magia de um reino secreto se pode ajustar, se pode aplicar ao quotidiano de um castelo (desculpem, de um prédio). Uma leitura sem esforço, rápida, a bom ritmo, fruto de um enredo intrincado e impecavelmente tecido.Confesso que, no fim, fiquei com algumas perguntas sem resposta, queria esmiuçar ainda mais os meandros deste mundo mágico. A minha imaginação acabou por preencher esses detalhes. Gostei bastante deste livro, ao ponto, de lhe ter dado continuidade completando essas lacunas.Curiosidade: o brilho de uma história de fantasia, de um mundo mágico pode remanescer, mesmo quando tudo se transforma em realidade.Como ler este livro e não refletir sobre as pessoas à nossa volta? Todos têm a suas próprias histórias, as suas vidas, as suas amarguras, as suas derrotas, os seus heróis.A minha sorte é que “um homem não chora”, pois caso contrário a coisa complicava-se! Se assim não fosse, as últimas emocionantes cento e tal páginas iriam ser embaraçosas.Uma história inicialmente engraçada, transita para momentos de extrema emoção (que, caso não fosse homem, choraria com toda a certeza) e finalmente para um suspense final.Gostei!"

I only requested it on NetGalley because I liked the cover and this one was also under the Women’s Fiction/Literature category so I thought why not. Many thanks to Atria Books for providing this ARC. So I came to read this book without having any preconceptions or expectations, as I hadn’t heard of Fredrik Backman or his previous novel. And how I love it when I am pleasantly surprised! The title alone is quirky and different. I’m pretty sure it’s one of the longest novel titles I’ve ever come across.“Every seven-year-old deserves a superhero. That’s just how it is. Anyone who doesn’t agree needs their head examined.” I was hooked. Almost instantly. And it only got better and better after that.The story is told in the third person (and how I love this!), from the precocious Elsa's perspective. She loves words, correct spelling, and “she knows she’s different”. Also, she’s a very lonely girl, whose only friend is her seventy-seven-year-old maternal grandmother. Her unorthodox, politically incorrect, retired doctor grandmother likes to smoke indoors and to cause mischief at every opportunity. They both adore each other. Grandma encourages Elsa to stay different. At night, she tells Elsa stories, in the Land of Almost-Awake and the Kingdom of Miamas, where everybody is different and nobody is normal.Unfortunately, grandma dies. She leaves Elsa a quest of sorts: delivering letters to different people to say sorry for past grievances. And this is how Elsa gets to know all her neighbours and she also learns some valuable lessons. I don’t want to say too much because of spoilers. You should really read it for yourself. It’s magical, quirky, funny, charming and very well written. I loved the tone of the narration, the mystical fairytales intermingling with reality. Elsa’s observations are just precious, candid and wonderfully endearing. Certain parts of the novel made me think of the French movie, Amelie, and also of another marvellous book, Sophie’s World, written by the Norwegian, Jostein Gaarder. I can only imagine how amazing the Swedish version must be, but kudos to the translator, Henning Koch, for doing such a great job.I loved so many things about this novel. There’s so much one can draw from it. But ultimately, it’s about daring to be different, about being seen and heard, about love, redemption, and forgiveness. It’s also about the importance of grandparents. I had a wonderful grandmother, who was a bit unusual.And because I love this book so much, I am going to buy the paperback, as this is a book that I want to re-read and give special friends. I believe in gifting good books. This one is definitely in the ""great books"" category. Recommended: 

ABSOLUTELY!!!!

 If you’ve had a special grandparent; if you like whimsy; if you like smart and most importantly, different, than this book is for you. Cover: 5 stars"
64,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19559507-carolyn,Rating 5 out of 5,"In seven year old Elsa's world her granny is her superhero. She tells her it's Ok to be different and to live your life as you want just as she always has, becoming a doctor when people said girls couldn't do that, working in war zones, rescuing orphans and behaving disgracefully in her old age. Granny also tells Elsa fairy tales set in a magical world populated by princes and princesses, dragons and other mythical creatures where Elsa can retreat in her imagination. So when Elsa's granny dies, she loses her only friend and has no one to protect her from the reality of being different. Granny however has foreseen that and after her death sends Elsa on a quest to deliver letters to people granny needs to apologise to, introducing Elsa to many of the characters she recognises from her imaginary world. I thought this was a wonderful and touching story. It's not really explained how Elsa is so 'different' that she is so picked on and bullied at school but she is very bright for her age and not a typical little girl, preferring to dress up as Spiderman rather than a princess or fairy. She is fixated on superhero comics, Star Wars, Harry Potter and using correct grammar and spelling so she has trouble fitting in with her peers. Elsa's smartness and her wisdom into reading other people's feelings did seem just a bit too precocious for her age given that she had led a fairly sheltered life, but perhaps we need to accept that her unusual relationship with her very different grandmother have made her wiser than her years. I loved the way the fairy tale world granny had set up for Elsa came to meld and support the real world in which Elsa lived and helped her cope with her grandmother's death, her separated parents and the impending birth of her half-sibling. As well as being able to tell a great story, one of Fredrik Backman's strengths is his understanding of human nature in creating wonderful, original characters. Not only are Elsa and Granny individual and unique but the supporting characters like Wolfheart, Alf, Britt-Marie and the Wurse are fully formed with all their flaws and foibles. There was also a lot of humour in this book with lots of laugh out loud moments and some great dialogue. Highly recommended!"

67,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22027176-connor,Rating 5 out of 5,"My Video Review:https://youtu.be/MBEAGPMy5PgQuite frankly, I loved it. I did receive a copy of this book through BookTube Tours run by Grace from LovingDemBooks, but the opinions stated herein are my own. I'm not the biggest reader of literary fiction, so I'm not sure how this compares. However, I found it incredibly heartwarming and moving. My biggest pro for this book is Granny. She is so wild, chaotic, and cantankerous, but she's also the best grandmother you could ever have and loves fiercely. She's described multiple times as someone you would want to bring with you when you go to war. She is that loyal and a force to be reckoned with. While I don't think many people have grandmothers like this, there are parts of her that I think anyone would recognize in their own grandparents or parents even. I definitely had (he's not passed, but he doesn't remember me much anymore) a super close relationship with my own grandfather, and I think having that bond made me love Granny in this novel all the more. One thing I found weird about Granny is that she's terrible at spelling even though she was supposed to be this amazing doctor. Misspelling a drug would definitely cause problems. However, she might just do it on purpose to annoy Elsa. I don't know. Elsa was fantastic. I've seen people say that had a problem with how Elsa doesn't come across as a 7 year old in her writing, and they're right to a point. She does have a much more complicated diction than most her age, but that's a point in the book. It's part of what makes her different which is a big theme in the novel. I do think she has a lot of patterns that children her age have though. She talks in circles sometimes in the narrative which can make the reading experience a little slower, but everyone knows how kids keep telling the same story without meaning to. Also, she doesn't sound much older in the dialogue. She does a lot of the same stubborn things that almost eight-year-olds do. Anyway, I found her super charming and someone I was rooting for even if she could at times be a bit much. I like stories that have different plot lines that interconnect and weave together as the story progresses, and this is totally one of them as I expected. I don't want to say more because I don't want to spoil. The only thing I really have a complaint on is that at the beginning, I thought it seemed to be trying too hard to include things that the reader would like too. For instance she loves Harry Potter and comic books/ superheros. She likes Star Wars and reading as many books as she can get her hands on. At first I kind of rolled my eyes about it, but as the story went on the many, many Harry Potter references were making me laugh out loud so hard. You will definitely love this book more if you've read and watched Harry Potter. This review is already too long, so I'll probably talk a bit more in my video review which will be up soon. Loved this book, and I can't wait to read the other books I can get by him. The translator did a fantastic job. Henning Kosh. Props."
68,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4428094-fictionophile,Rating 5 out of 5,"One of my favorite novels from last year was “A man called Ove” by Fredrik Backman. So you can imagine my delight when I heard he has written another novel!“My grandmother asked me to tell you she’s sorry” didn’t disappoint.Although both novels featured an older person’s interactions with a young person, they were vastly different. This charming novel was a parable encased in a fairy tale. The characters were just as endearing, the tone was the same – yet this story was somehow more uplifting…The novel is ostensibly that of a little girl named Elsa who is seven years old and her beloved grandmother. Both she and her grandmother are considered different – in her grandmother’s case – downright eccentric. Yet they are each other’s favorite person – always on each other’s side even when they are in the wrong. They live in a house which has been broken up into flats. Each tenant of the house plays an integral part in the story.Elsa lives in a flat on the top floor across the hall from her grandmother. She lives with her pregnant, perfectionist mother and her mother’s partner. Her mum is orderly whilst her grandmother is chaotic. She regularly visits her father and her stepmother who has other children.Years ago her grandmother was a surgeon who helped saved many lives. Now, aging and eccentric she makes up fairy tales to entertain and to teach her beloved granddaughter. Her motto is that lies and fairy tales are just other versions of the truth. As a result of her grandmother’s stories Elsa has a penchant for words and grammar. As a big fan of Harry Potter, she is also an expert in ‘quality literature’.After her grandmother’s death she is tasked with delivering apology letters from her grandmother to those people in her grandmother’s life whom she has slighted, wounded or distressed in any way. Along the way she finds new friends and comes to understand some of the mysteries surrounding her family.The story was told in a humorous way, but there were parts to pull on the heartstrings as well. With themes of the ‘superpower’ of the imagination and the importance of individuality, this novel is didactic without being preachy.Originally published in Swedish, I’m certain that nothing was lost in translation.Both fanciful and farcical , this is a book that makes you both laugh and cry, “My Grandmother asked me to tell you she’s sorry” is highly recommended! I plan to read EVERYTHING Fredrik Backman writes!I seriously envy the author’s children and can only speculate at the diversity and entertainment that they must derive from his bedtime stories. Surely all other children are bereft in comparison.Heartfelt thanks to Atria Books via NetGalley for providing me with a digital ARC of this wonderful novel."

This book packs a similar emotional punch at the end, but has some significant differences. It is told from the point of view of Elsa, a seven year old child who loves Harry Potter, fairy tales and her grandmother. I had a little trouble at the beginning following all the fairy tale references and believing a seven year old could be this smart/brave/wise. Then I remembered Pippi Longstocking and other heroines/heroes of children's literature and got into the spirit of this book. I stopped trying to make the story fit my adult view of the world and entered into Elsa's world. Once I did that, I had a whale of a time."

Це буде вельми іронічно, якщо взяти до уваги те, скільки уваги в цій книзі приділено праву бути інакшим і мати про все власну думку. )Цю книгу мені приніс Миколай, і я одразу подумки почала підшуковувати їй місце на полиці зі своїми улюбленицями. Здавалося б, у неї є все, щоб по-справжньому мені сподобатися, адже це історія про бабусю і онучку, а це моя тема. Але не склалося. Це таки непогана книга, але й не чудова.Почнімо з хорошого: образ бабці добре вдався Фредеріку Бакману (між іншим, у цьому перекладі її постійно називають ""бабуня"", бр-р-р...). Вона з тих холеричних, надто діяльних і разом з тим ""мені в дупі, що ви про це думаєте"" людей, яких легко любити на відстані, але дуже, дуже важко, якщо це член вашої сім'ї. Бо рано чи пізно, чаша терпіння переповнюється, і всі ми хочемо спокою, дорослості, адекватного ставлення, особливо, якщо це ваша мама. Коли ти сама ще дитина, то хочеться, щоб батьки поводилися, як дорослі, брали на себе відповідальність, а не просто лишали тебе на багато місяців на чужу людину. Але ця книжка про силу прощення, тож гаразд, можна вибачити навіть таке. До того ж, з народженням онучки ця вертихвістка неждано-негадано кидає роботу, поважніє і цілком присвячує себе малій, ""коханню свого життя"".""Бо треба про щось піклуватися, Ельзо. Та щойно хтось про щось починав піклуватися в цьому світі, твоя бабуся відразу обзивала це «занудством». Але ж якщо ні про що не піклуватися, то ти наче й не живеш. Так тільки, існуєш...""На початку роману бабуся помирає, і починається квест з доставкою листів нечисленним сусідам. І тут починаються й мої проблеми з цим текстом. Найважливіша з них — це абсолютна нереалістичність Ельзи. Вона поводить себе, як 15-річна, а не 7-річна дитина, навіть якщо не брати до уваги те, що вона нібито прочитала 12 разів 800-сторінковий ""Орден Фенікса"" у тому віці, коли більшість дітей ще читають по складах. Таке враження, що автор вважає, як він написав, що дитина розумна, то вже можна приписувати їй думки і вчинки, які властиві на 10 років старшим підліткам. Є розум, а є досвід. І саме його бракує 7-річним дівчаткам, тому вони й роблять усі ті дурниці, які всі ми робимо дітьми. А ще вона нібито вміє водити бабусин ""Рено""!.. Та вона ж банально не дотягнеться до педалей. І от наша Ельза нібито така розумна, робить цілий ґвалт, коли псу дають похлебтати кави, а сама годує його шоколадом! Після такого він мав би одразу відлетіти до Країни Спросоння. Також вона каже про себе, що переймається проблемами довкілля, а сама щороку купує нову ПЛАСТИКОВУ ялинку. Ну, в неї ж батьки розлучені, їй можна. Також вона вважає, що можна кидатись у людей глобусами, накричати на водія, який сигналить позаду, набрехати поліції, нав'язливого виправляти вимову навіть незнайомих людей. У мене склалося враження, що в Ельзи немає ні найменшої поваги ні до кого (як це часто буває саме в підлітків).""Хлопчика з синдромом"" вона так і називає до кінця книги. Для мене це все одно, що гукати до знайомого у візку: ""Агов, людино з інвалідністю!"" чи до невисокого: ""Привіт, курдуплю!"".""Беручи до уваги, що ти така розумна, варто зазначити, що й на тебе іноді нападає тупість.""Туше, бабусю.Найдивніше те, що всі сусіди в будинку виявляються поєднаними, багато-хто з них кровно, хоча спершу поводяться як чужі. І чому наша розумненька дівчинка не здогадалася про це все? І чому наша шалена бабця, яка спокійно розповідала 7-річній ��ібито дитині про свої любовні походеньки, приховує це все? Особливо зважаючи на те, що була цілком конкретна загроза життю і здоров'ю дитини? Бабця з Ельзою показуються в романі як найкращі друзі, але чому ж при цьому вони ніколи не відвідують сусідів — знайомих і родичів бабусі?А наприкінці дитина, яка в сім років дружила лише з бабцею і пізніше псом, раптом стає центром цілого гурту приятелів. Не віриться щось.Є претензії й конкретно до українського видання. Це перша в моїй книгозбірні книжка видаництва ""КНИГОЛАВ"", яке, як і багато з них, любить позиціонувати себе як таке, що видає винятково якісний продукт. Найбільша і найголовніша вада — це, звісно, перепереклад з англійської. Я читаю чимало шведського, і не в останню чергу тому, що ми маємо цілий ряд прекр��сних перекладачів з цієї мови. Без жодних підглядань можу назвати чудових Наталю Іваничук, Ольгу Сенюк, Галину Кирпу, Олега Короля. Натомість видавництво поскупилося (?) чи не захотіло чекати, чи то просто вирішило ""а чьо там?"". Поза тим переклад пані Захарченко можна назвати щонайбільше непоганим, він кепсько витриманий стилістично — можна згадати хоча б персонажа Альфа, який постійно лається, оці його постійні ""трясця"" виглядали не лише несмішно, а просто поганим тоном. Не розумію, чому на обкладинці бабуся, а в самому тексті постійно ""бабуня"". Також текст погано вичитаний — звернула увагу на дивну помилку — малу літеру після крапки. Коли це трапляється кілька разів в одному розділі, це вже просто непрофесійно. Обкладинка також якось не грає мені з книгою, в якій більшість подій відбуваються напередодні Різдва, а тут ця зелена трава, квіти... То мав би бути Міамас, чи як? Ельза так само не виглядає на сім років. Ой, вибачте, майже вісім.

75,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51069187-marie,Rating 4 out of 5,"“Every seven-year-old deserves a superhero. That’s just how it is.“ For Elsa, her grandmother is her superhero, however as the book progresses Elsa begins to notices superpowers in all those close to her. This book has a childlike honesty and curiosity to it. It is told from Elsa’s 7 year old perspective. There is much humor and sweetness to this book.It is a heartwarming quirky tale that begins with the relationship between a grandmother and her 7 year old granddaughter. Granny is eccentric and will do anything to protect and guide Elsa through life. The 7 year old Elsa is a wise-for-her-age little girl who comes across as “different” from her peers and is the subject of bullying at school. Her best and only friend is her grandmother. The grandmother goes to great lengths to distract Elsa from her rough days, including a scene where Elsa and her grandmother sneak into the zoo late at night and when the police arrive, Granny proceeds to throw animal poop at them.After Elsa’s parents divorce, Granny weaves a series of fantastical fairy tales that take place in a world that Elsa thinks only she and her grandmother know about, the “Land-of -almost-awake.” The grandmother also teaches her a secret language so they can speak to each other without others knowing what they are saying.Elsa is not told by the grandmother that she is dying until just before her death at which point she is sent on a mysterious mission whereby she must deliver a series of letters. Through this process of letter delivering Elsa develops a better sense of who her grandmother was, her grandmother’s relationship with her mother, as well as understands the relationships of those living in the building with her. These people in her building become sort of an extended family for Elsa.This fantastical world that Granny tells to Elsa serves as a framework for the Elsa to understand the relationship between all of those around her. She realizes that these fantastical stories are actually true stories about those around her, and seemingly becomes wiser as a result. She appreciates the people around her better, their relationships to each other, and feels more connected to them.While reading the book, I wondered at the seemingly random titles given to each chapter, but they came together perfectly in the last paragraph of the book.While the book was originally written in Swedish, it really could have taken place anywhere. There are a few Swedish cultural references, such as Daim chocolate bars.If interested in pictures & discussion questions, please visit my website: http://www.book-chatter.com/?p=30."

The pace of the story was too slow and the pathos was a bit overdone. I know that many readers loved this book. Maybe it’s because of my high expectations after A Man Called Ove but this novel was just OK for me, unfortunately. Favourite quotes:All the best people are different—look at superheroes. After all, if superpowers were normal, everyone would have them.If you can’t get rid of the bad, you have to top it up with more goody stuff."
77,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64621419-dennis,Rating 4 out of 5,"Backman won me over in the end.This is another very good book by one of my favorite authors. But it’s not as flawless as some of his other works.It’s the story of a very intelligent, verrrry precocious 7 year-old girl named Elsa. A girl that has almost no friends, because she’s different. So different in fact, that her character was bordering on being unbelievable. I was having quite a hard time accepting that she’s meant to be 7 years old, or almost eight, like Fredrik Backman tells us. Her grandmother was the star of this novel for me, in the beginning.Elsa’s Granny is one of those quirky characters that Backman does so well. She might be chaotic and overly rebellious, but she’s got her heart in the right place. And she would do anything for Elsa. She might be her only friend. Elsa’s grandma also created a fairy-tale world, in which Elsa might find comfort, and maybe even some friends. Eventually she will send Elsa on a quest. A quest that slowly will bring together the fictional world with the real world. A quest that will help Elsa understand.Elsa and her mother and stepfather, and grandma as well, live in an apartment building with a lot of other 'special' characters. And the book is at its best when several of those characters converge. It often leads to hilarious situations. Because, let me tell you, those are quite some personalities. But people also have a dark side. And life can be cruel. And in a Fredrik Backman novel most of the time you will see both these sides. Laughing and crying often times are very close together for the reader of his books.The sad parts of this story didn’t work very well for me in the beginning. Because they mostly occured when the book focused on Elsa, who I hadn’t bought into at that point, and maybe one or two other persons. At that point I was always waiting for something funny to happen, which it ultimately did. This fine balance between being sad and funny, without ever losing its momentum, something Backman usually does better than anyone else out there, it didn’t quite work for me here. But that’s mainly because of the problems I had with Elsa’s character. At some point I decided to just accept her the way she is, and let Backman work his magic. And that he does, without a doubt. This is another book full of wise observations of the human nature, and of how relationships work. Especially the difficult ones. The star of the book, in the end, turned out to be someone else altogether. And the story itself held a couple of surprises as well.Ultimately this is a story about being different, about loss and acceptance, about trying to know and understand people. It’s also a story about self-discovery and the great power of a good laugh. And about the fact that people who don’t know Harry Potter really need their heads examined.
One could say it’s right and one could say it’s wrong. And probably both would be right. Because life is both complicated and simple. Which is why there are cookies.
The guy just makes it so damn hard to disagree with him."
78,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39215947-jane,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 starsARGH! Such an impossible book to review properly. I wanted to fall madly in love with this book. By the end, I think I had a little bit. But it was too little, too late, and there were just too many problems for me to enthusiastically rave about this book.I adored Ove and I really liked Britt-Marie, but neither hold a candle to Elsa -- she's one of my very favourite characters ever! I liked all of the supporting characters in this book much more than those in A Man Called Ove or in Britt-Marie Was Here. This book made me chuckle and it made me cry. By all rights this book should hit my 5-star, all-time favourite shelf with no hesitations.But then there was the bloody Land-of-Almost-Awake. While I get the reasoning (and likely necessity) of these bits, they really dragged the book down. They pulled me too far out of the main story as I pondered what the strange names and words meant (and occasionally even stopped reading completely to google the words to see if I could sort it out better). In the end, while most of it ended up making more sense, I was still left with questions that niggled at me (Which real language was the secret language?! How could Elsa, who suspiciously googled everything else Granny told her (including some pretty fuzzy metaphors that she was able to correctly figure out), not have looked up (as I eventually did) the names for the various places in the Land-of-Almost-Awake? What was the backstory for the cop with the green eyes?). I also found scenes with the wurse to be perplexing. I have no idea why this poor animal was fed so much chocolate (horribly poisonous to dogs), nor why none of the adults seemed to have a problem 'hiding' this dog in various cramped locations for long periods of time. Surely there could have been a better, more realistic handling of this part of the story. I cringed each time the wurse was involved because it was sure to mean more shoddy treatment of the poor animal.I can't say this is a terrible book -- it made me feel some real feels, but I really wish the sections dealing with the Land-of-Almost-Awake had been handled differently."

Albeit with a theme that readers of Mr. Backman’s work will be familiar with.Take an apartment block and fill it with some of the most anti-social, disgruntled folks you could dream up.Now take seven, going on seventeen, year old Elisa a young girl who, by her own admission, is a bit different for the rest of her peers. Elisa has only one real friend in her young life that being her granny. It’s little wonder that Elisa I a bit different because granny, on her day, can be a real fruit loop.Because of her being different Elisa found that she was the perfect target for the bullies at school.So, after a trying day at school granny would tell Elisa tales of ‘The land of Nearly Asleep’ which turned out to be great metaphors for life.When granny died, as granny’s do, Elisa not only lost her granny but she also lost her best friend.But before departing this world granny set Elisa a quest. The quest was to give letters, from granny, to her fellow tenants. The letters had to be delivered in a specific order and when Elisa handed it over she had to tell the recipient of the letter that “My Grandmother asked me to tell you the she’s sorry”As the letters are handed out and read we get to see the other side of all these anti-social, disgruntled people.Mostly the stories are sad but the revealing leaves the reader feeling uplifted. Well this reader did.All this and a great cover to boot. Don’t miss this one. Highly recommended."

85,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20814018-j-lie,Rating 5 out of 5,"Fredrik Backman has a brilliant mind! I loved his last book, A Man Called Ove, and I absolutely Loved this, his latest book. What a clever man you are Fredrik Backman, you have such a deep understanding of the human heart and all its many foibles and weaknesses...and what is more, you know how to express them with word pictures.This beautiful and moving story is told through the voice of seven year old Elsa. Some might say that Elsa is a precocious child and way too 'old' for her young age, but Elsa has spent a lot of her young years in the company of her eccentric Grandmother.She is a girl in a story, don't overanalyze her...or you just might miss out.Elsa and her Grandmother have a very special relationship that would rival the best of friendships any ""almost eight year old"" could wish for. So that even during her moments of torment from other children in her school, who see her as being different, Elsa feels content in the knowledge that she can wallow in the unconditional love and friendship that her Grandmother offers her everyday...along with her fierce support.Granny is her superhero, and when she picks Elsa up from school at the end of the day, they almost always embark on another one of her zany...but, often calculated...adventures.Elsa lives in an apartment block with her mother and her [mother's] de facto partner George, and because of their heavy working schedules, Granny, who lives across the landing in the next flat, looks after Elsa for most of her free time.The apartment block, which is called their house, also has other tenants who appear to have some quirky characteristics as well, and as the story progresses and we are introduced to each of them, we start to find the connections they all share.This is a wonderful laugh out loud, moving, sensitive and touching story which is not as airy fairy as it sometimes sounds. There are moments when you could laugh out loud and cry all at once...and there are heartfelt moments when you do both separately.Fredrik Backman is a master of metaphors and this story is filled with many such artful gems, as well as many lol quotable quotes...I think I highlighted most of the book! His ability to build and incorporate alternate fantasy worlds is also a notable talent.I absolutely loved this book and will have no hesitation in recommending it to friends.I will be eagerly awaiting more from this author! 5★sThanks to NetGalley and the Publishers for my copy to read and review.

86,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wonderful book! While I think that A Man Called Ove will always be my favorite, this book is still an engrossing and powerful read. The author weaves a series of fairy tales, told to Elsa by her grandmother, into the main story of how Elsa deals with not only her grandmother's death, but the quest that her grandmother has entrusted to her—to deliver a series of letters to people with apologies.I love books where this interweaving is done skillfully—and this one is *masterfully* done. The heroes and bad guys in the fairy stories turn out to all be based on real people and real events. Every interesting tangent and thread turns out to interconnect with others in Elsa's world, and everything wraps up in the end, with a very satisfying conclusion. The bravery of The Monster, the courage of the fierce and noble Wurse as he guards his princess, the unexpected heroicness of characters major and minor are heartwarming. This story manages to be both funny and sad. Definitely recommend!!"

Struggling in school and having a hard time with the close arrival of Halfie (her half bother or sister), Elsa turns to her grandmother for support. Elsa's grandmother is quite different too, constantly saying the wrong thing or getting in trouble and not being apologetic for any of it. When she passes away, Elsa's grandmother leaves behind a series of letters for Elsa to deliver. It is her final quest for Elsa, one that will take her beyond the realm of imagination.Fredrick Backman has done it again: he has delivered an outstanding story full of memorable characters and a heartfelt message. Having read A Man Called Ove earlier this year, I was really looking forward to this novel. It did not dissapoint. Elsa is a precocious 7-year-old girl, one that loves to read, baffles the adults around her on a regular basis and has her grandmother as her hero. Her grandmother might just be my superhero too. A bit on the crazy side but loveable none-the-less. See, Elsa's grandmother created a fantasy world of prince/princesses, dragons, knights and a whole slew of characters to which both could escape. Initially, I found the fairy tale aspect hard to follow but as the story progressed it became clear that the characters in them were representative of the people in Elsa's life. As with his previous work, my favorite character has to be ""The Wurse"", a large dog that granny and Elsa looked after (in Ove, ""the Cat Annoyance"" was my favorite).The story was touching and endearing, even drawing tears towards the end (this being the second time Backman has managed to make me cry). I was already excited about the third book by Bachman, Brit-Marie was Here. Having read this, I can not wait for it. A great novel by an fantastic author.23/12/19 Re-read update“Having a grandmother is like having an army. This is a grandchild's ultimate privilege: knowing that someone is on your side, always, whatever the details. Even when you are wrong. Especially then, in fact. A grandmother is both a sword and a shield.” Elsa is seven (going on eight) and her grandmother is her superhero. Elsa's grandmother is different, quite different. So is Elsa. To embrace their differences the two of them escape to the Land-of-Almost-Awake every night where they encounter princes, princesses, knights, dragons, and wurses. Its not until her grandmother passes away (and leaves Elsa thetask to deliver apology letters) that Elsa realizes the parallels between the characters in her fantasy world and the tenants of the building she lives in. I first read this book about three years ago and I stand by my original review. Not just that, this time around I discovered nuances that I had not noticed in the first read. Fredrik Backman can write. The last quarter of the book had me sobbing, in tears. I knew they were coming and still, the emotions hit like it was the first time I laid eyes on these pages and in this narrative. I just absolutely love the way in which Backman intertwined the fantasy world and the real one. The way in which he layered the stories and how he used the fantasy elements to highlight the real-world ones. Backman sure knows how to run the reader through a gamut of emotions. I was also very close with my (maternal) grandmother growing up. She was my shield and my angel. Losing her hurts to this day (even though it has been 14 years since she passed) so that is a big reason why this book resonates with me so much. Thank you, Backman for reminding me of the magic of grandmothers. This is such a moving and heartwarming book. With heart and humour, and so many lessons that can be drawn , this book is just amazing. I LOVE IT!!!!This book is just perfect, in every way. "

Living in the house in the different apartments were Alf, Britt-Marie and Kent, Maud and Lennard and the lady in the black skirt. Some were nice, some were not. But Granny took Elsa to the Land-of-Almost-Awake most days – filled with fairy tales and dreams, Elsa loved visiting the Kingdom of Miamas. Elsa only had one friend at almost eight years old and that was Granny who was seventy seven years old. She could run really fast; getting away from the bullies at school because she was different was how she learned to run...Elsa’s Mum was pregnant – Halfie (they didn’t know if it was a boy or a girl) made Elsa feel out of sorts – jealous. Dad lived with Lisette and her two children; she stayed with Dad every other weekend. But when Granny died Elsa was shattered; how could Granny leave her? Why did she have to die? Elsa had been given the task of a treasure hunt right before Granny died – the form of letters which Elsa had to find, first one then the next. Granny’s apology letters led to Elsa’s biggest adventure yet – she loved the wurst and the monster that she found – but hiding them was a different matter. As Elsa’s adventures broadened she found out things about her neighbours and wondered at the connection with them to her Granny. Would she find these answers? Would she stop missing her Granny so much?My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry by Fredrik Backman is the next story after the blockbuster A Man Called Ove which I loved. I’m afraid I didn’t love this one as much – it took me quite some time to get into as I got used to Elsa’s voice. Narrated by an almost eight year old child was certainly different, and her constant use of Wikipedia was amusing. She is an extremely smart child, but very naïve as well. Her heartfelt grief at losing her beloved Granny who had been her champion all of her life – protecting her from life’s bullies; supporting her in all ways that Grannies do was incredibly well done. The fairy tales were long and frequent. There will be many who will love this fantastical story as much as A Man Called Ove – I wish I had. But I still have no hesitation in recommending it to all.With thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for my copy to read and review."
91,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7862560-la-canter,Rating 1 out of 5,"Incredibly, I did not care for this second book from Backman. First of all, I am not a fan of magical realism. Secondly, the brassiness of the grandmother and the little girl seems to show that the author relies on shock value and inappropriate comments to try to garner respect for the young, the old, and the female - or maybe to make us laugh? - but it doesnt work for me. In his first book, the character of Ove is an outspoken curmudgeon, but he had valid points for his complaints. That an old woman would pick up a globe off the desk of her grand child's headmaster and throw it at his head or that a seven-year-old girl would hop out of her mothers car during a traffic jam to scream at an adult driver for honking, then slam his hood with her schoolbook were hard scenes to accept as realistic, let alone persuade me to admire these tantrums. Yes, I get that Backman likes writing about old people and children because they are far less guarded in what they say aloud, but he tried too hard here. Characters, even those in books of magical realism, should seem REAL. In this book we not only see the marionettes' strings, but the puppeteer himself. Particularly bothersome were the horribly disrespectful comments of the child, Elsa, towards all of the adults throughout the story. There is one scene on page 66 where this child is mocking her mother and accusing her of being happy that Granny is dead. When the mom starts sobbing, Elsa continues to say hateful things to her. The mother finally, in all capital letters, shouts at her that the child is not the only one who is upset and that she needs to stop acting like a little brat. Suddenly, this poor bereaved woman stops, horrified, and apologizes to the little brat. The mother acts as if she had just slapped the child across the face or something, and not just raised her voice. The mom - whose own mother has just died - is pregnant and emotional. In an evil little twist, Elsa - who does not want the baby to be born - tells her mother to not get upset. She sarcastically suggests ""you'd better think of the baby,"" as if she could miscarry or something from raising her voice. I really disliked the main character - a 7 year old - and that is saying something!The only one sorry here is me for having my hopes so high. I LOVED ""A Man Called Ove,"" but this read more like a YA drama queen fairy tale. Sorry!"

I was expecting some lighthearted quick read about a little girl going on a mission after the death of her grandmother but I was given something so different and even better than I could have expected. So to start, this book follows a girl named Elsa and her best and only friend in the entire world is her Grandmother. Her Grandmother has always told her these fairytales about the world of the Land of Almost Awake and when her grandmother dies in the beginning she sends Elsa on a quest where she finds out that maybe everything her grandmother told her has been true. The thing I love about this book is the way you learn in it. Elsa is only 8 years old, so while she is a very smart 8 year old, she doesn't know a lot of things. So this book is a journey. Eventually it all comes completely full circle and I think the way it was done was so so so well handled. While I loved the plot, the fictional world and quest Elsa is on is amazing, the characters really made this book for me. I loved them all (all except 2 actually). They were all so complex and distinct and done so in a way that only a child could have made distinct. The book is written by an adult, but he writes children so well. I felt like I was seeing the world and learning about the world honestly through a children's eye. She sees people and described people in a way that I felt on a child could have. In that regards this book was really really well done.I think I'll leave my review here, mostly because I will be filming a video review, and mostly because I think that a lot of what I want to say will make more sense when I can say it outloud because I seem to be having an issue depicting what I really loved about this book! But I honestly recommend it, it was heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time and just a really lovely story in so many ways. Around The Year in 52 Books Challenge #13 - Reader's Choice"

Fredrik Backman (n. 1981) é um escritor sueco que sabe contar uma história, aliando uma excepcional caracterização das personagens, que o leitor sente como autênticas pessoas, com a conjugação de ocorrências e eventos dramáticos a que se associa o humor e uma afectividade verdadeiramente genuína."

The actual book ""only"" gets 4 stars from me because the accumulation of numerous mini stories wasn't always as clear cut as the other books I've read by Backman and while I felt for Elsa and was aggravated and frustrated on her behalf, the impact wasn't as hauntingly melancholic as in the first book I read from this author (might be because of the topic though).What is this about?It's about the aforementioned girl called Elsa. She is a bit of a special child, with difficulties in concentrating thanks to both her parents being slightly on the OCD/Asperger's side of the spectrum. She also loves her grandmother dearly. But her grandmother is sick and dies and suddenly Elsa feels all alone in the world with nobody really taking her side anymore because when you're 7 years old, most adults don't really take you seriously (if they take notice in the first place).But her grandmother has written a letter and thus sends her grandchild on a sort of quest to meet new people and form connections. I must say that I also had a bit of a hard time here because nearly EVERYBODY in this book was either downright crazy or had some form of mental health problem. And while I agree that many people do have mental health problems and should be represented in books and other art forms just like anybody else, it was a bit much here. Especially since there is a fine line between quirky and obnoxious or simply annoying (which is the side of the spectrum many here fell on).But I loved Elsa. Yes, she was a very sensitive child, partially owed to her mental constitution. And yes, she was ""altklug"" (precocious) but some children just are. The bullying she had to endure hit as close to home as her faible for Harry Potter or Marvel (and DC) superheroes so I really liked that aspect. Just like I laughed heartily about granny's quirks (her liking young police officers for example) or how Elsa made a certain guy scramble for words other than swearwords. *lol*I was surprised to find that this was such a mosaic of little stories-within-the-story. It wasn't a bad stylistic device but it sometimes caused me to lose the red thread. Nevertheless, the big bad (apart from the one that got the story going in the beginning) hit me quite hard, attesting to the author's ability to make you care. Not to mention that I went damn near ballistic about the headmaster and other people.Quirky little girl: check.Dog: check.Cultural references I can identify with: check.Emotional impact: check.So yeah, 4 stars for the story itself plus one bonus star for HP and the X-Men. ;)"

I went in blind without really knowing what it was about.Elsa was seven years old and a very unique child. She was incredibly eloquent, well read courtesy of wikipedia, and smart as a whip. Also she was quite the smarty pants and know-it-all and her relationship with her grandmother was truly special. It was actually so special that they had their own secret language that they conversed in anytime they didn't want to be overheard, even in front of police officers. Her Grandmother told the most fascinating stories. Of cloud animals, princesses, fairytales, magic, and about a land far away where everything was possible. She was also dying of cancer and her last wish was for Elsa to go on a mission. Elsa was supposed to deliver letters, so her Granny could apologize to all the people that she wronged during her lifetime. Each letter Else delivered, also led her to the next person, and so on. During this mission Elsa got to know the renters in her grandmother and her mother's apartment building. Her grandmother's bequest forced her to overcome her fears by communicating to adults that were in parts scary and mysterious to her. Throughout this journey she found out that the person she loved the most, her grandmother, wasn't as loving to everyone else as she was to her and it was quite a shock to Elsa. But delivering the letters helped her and everyone else involved to let go and to forgive.Thoughts:It took me a good while to understand what Grandmother's stories were all about. But besides that the overall plot was quite cleverly done. Elsa's character was easily likable by being a very interesting and unique character. She was very vocal, and her attitude made me LOL many times.This being my second book by Fredrik Backman, I already can say that the author has a wonderful way with words. The story was quite fascinating and unique. And the build up and how it all wrapped up in the end was beautifully done. I'm looking forward to his next books."
100,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59568642-kevin-kuhn,Rating 4 out of 5,"A wonderful story of a precocious seven year-old, her free-spirited granny, and a flat full of interesting characters. Seven-year-old Elsa is wise, way beyond her years. She and her Granny have a made-up language and an entire world of fantasy to share - the land of Almost Awake. I loved the characters in this story, every one is unique and interesting. Granny and Elsa's fairy tale world is rich and imaginative as well. However, the first half of the novel is roughly 90% narration. There is little dialog, and although the narration is wonderfully written, it's still narration. It took me a while to figure out, why this story with excellent characters, and an interesting plot, with much to discover was dragging. When I stepped back I realized it was from the amount of narration. I want author Backman to pull me into land of Almost Awake and Elsa's reality, show me how the characters are experiencing the tension and let me hear them interact. Instead, I get to hear it through lots of narration. Here is the crazy thing, Backman still somehow mostly pulls it off - he kept me engaged - with almost all narration. His vocabulary is vast and he keeps up the tension through-out. The final third of the book, picks up, as we get more dialog and more direct action. So, I rated this story at four stars, mostly because it's difficult to get engaged early on, and we don't connect with the characters near as much as we could. But, even with this challenge, I still really liked this book. It's unpredictable and it's full of wisdom (some from a 77 year old, some from a 7 year old). I love how a seemly unrelated group of characters are woven together just as deftly as the Land of Almost Awake is woven into the reality of Granny's past. Worth the read, and Backman has substantial talent. But I still finished this book with a bitter taste in my mouth, because, I believe this very entertaining book, could of been an absolutely fantastic and memorable classic if we had been pulled into the story earlier with more dialog and direct action."

This novel takes you on an adventure into Elsa and her grandmother's imagination in which you meet a fairy tale world that makes the real world easier to survive. Elsa and her grandmother have a unique relationship, and the underlying humour of Elsa's perspectives on things is so endearing. This is one of those books that you can read when you need something relaxing and entertaining. While it seems peculiar and humorous on the surface, I believe it does have some depth to it when it comes to life as a child and how you have to get through obstacles in life. I liked this and its peculiar set of characters, and I do plan on reading more from Fredrik Backman in the future. "

Yes, I loved it that much and am confident I will read it again and again. In fact, I immediately started re-reading it after it ended, something I never do.“My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She’s Sorry” is the story of a precocious seven year old girl named Elsa and her slightly wacky and eccentric grandmother who creates the make-believe “Land of Almost Awake.” This world consists of a multitude of fairytales which help connect Elsa and her grandmother as well as Elsa and her neighbors. Elsa is “different” and this imaginary world helps her cope.This quote helps to show how Elsa learns about the power of being different “All fairy stories take their life from the fact of being different. ‘Only different people change the world,’ Granny used to say. ‘No one normal has ever changed a crapping thing.” The fairytales ultimately connects all the people that live around Elsa. She gets to know each one of them and their fairytale via letters her grandmother leaves for her in a treasure hunt of sorts after Granny passes away. “At first when Elsa’s Granny started telling her stories from Miamas, they only seemed like disconnected fairy tales without a context, told by someone who needed her head examined. It took years before Elsa understood that they belonged together All really good stories work like this.”The creativity and imagination contained within the pages is captivating as well as entertaining and the writing is superb. “Elsa is the sort of child who learned early in life that it’s easier to make your way if you get to choose your own soundtrack.” I enjoyed reading this book and laughed many times and felt sad on a few pages. I loved getting to know Elsa and the fairytales that connect her world. I now want to read every book by Frederick Backman and plan to do just that!"

""Having a grandmother is like having an army. This is a grand-child's ultimate privilege: knowing that someone is on your side, always, whatever the details. Even when you are wrong. Especially then, in fact. A grandmother is both a sword and a shield...""
― Fredrik Backman, ""My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry""

(Family Photo of My Maternal Grandmother)Even from beyond the grave, my grandmother’s words serve as both a sword and a shield, whispering so many meaningful things... Not necessarily in the traditional, phonetically-articulated form, but more so in the ethereal reverberations of an intuitive generational grace. In my mother's laughter, I hear the lyrical echoes of the feisty wisdom of her delightful chuckle. In my aunt's knowing smile, I cherish the warmth of her effluent optimism and cheer. In my uncles' strength of character, I glimpse her nuanced nudges of astute and patient guidance. In the closely-bound relationships of her children and grandchildren, I witness her unparalleled fortitude of interconnections and support. In my cousins' gentle and loving embrace of their own growing children, I imbibe her knowledge of resounding faith and kindness to find a renewed trust in the generations to come… 

A Battalion of Feisty Grandmothers...Indeed, grandmothers hold a very dear and special place in our hearts, even the feisty unconventional ones as we witness in Frederik Backman's whimsical book, “My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry”:

“Granny is seventy-seven years old, going on seventy-eight, […] but no one ever accuses Granny of being grown-up for her age. ‘Perky,’ people sometimes say to Elsa’s mum, looking either fairly worried or fairly angry as Mum sighs and asks how much she owes for the damages. […] They also say that Granny is mad, but in actual fact she is a genius. It’s just that she’s a bit of a crackpot at the same time. She used to be a doctor, and she won prizes and journalists wrote articles about her and she went to all the most terrible places in the world when everyone else was getting out. She saved lives and fought evil everywhere on earth. As superheroes do.”

For our almost eight-year-old protagonist, the precocious Elsa, Granny is her whole world… Granny’s army of support backs her up whenever she doesn’t fit in or even when she gets bullied and bruised at school. The lonelier little Elsa gets in the real world, the larger her fantastical battalion in the “Land-of-Almost-Awake” grows and envelops to come to her rescue. 

An Intricate Web of Fairy Tales...Elsa’s grandmother intricately weaves a marvelous web of fairy tales in order to help her grand-daughter better understand the confusing world-at-large:

“Granny has been telling these fairy tales for as long as Elsa can remember. In the beginning, they were only to make Elsa go to sleep, and to get her to practice Granny’s secret language, and a little because Granny is just about as nutty as a granny should be. But lately the stories have another dimension as well. Something Elsa can’t quite put her finger on.”

Stories become at once both completely realistic -- and at the same time, entirely fabricated: 
“Elsa remembers how Granny said that, ‘the best stories are never completely realistic and never entirely made-up.’ That was what Granny meant when she called certain things ‘reality-challenged.’ To Granny, there was nothing that was entirely one thing or another. Stories were completely for real and at the same time not.” 

The Traumatic Threads of the Past...In time we learn that Granny’s ""reality-challenged"" superpowers are also her downfall, as we start to slowly unravel the traumatic threads of history that propel these otherworldly creations into existence. A complicated past, that intertwines the close-knit band of community misfits, begins to sneak into the fray of understanding – nudging us out of the realm of the purely make believe:

“So many hearts broke the day Elsa was born. Shattered with such force by the wave that the shards of glass were dispersed all around the world. Improbable catastrophes produce improbable things in people, improbable sorrow and improbable heroism. More death than human senses can comprehend. […] Elsa’s granny lived in another rhythm from other people. She operated in a different way. In the real world, in relation to everything that functioned, she was chaotic. But when the real world crumbles, when everything turns into chaos, then people like Elsa’s granny can sometimes be the only ones who stay functional. That was another of her superpowers.”

It’s strange how close love and fear live in proximity to each other, says Granny. In the real world, terribly frightening things do indeed happen -- but somehow the graces of unconditional familial love and ongoing community support help us to find our way to a more solid ground of foundational solace: 

“People in the real world always say, when something terrible happens, that the sadness and loss and aching pain of the heart will ‘lessen as time passes’ but it isn’t true. Sorrow and loss are constant, but if we all had to go through our whole lives carrying them the whole time, we wouldn’t be able to stand it. The sadness would paralyze us. So in the end we just pack it into bags and find somewhere to leave it.”



The Sleuthing Protagonist...At the core of this story, there are many lingering mysteries that are revealed to Elsa to be sleuth-fully solved as in Foer’s “Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close”. And, I cannot go into too much more detail of this particular narrative without risking the possible trepidation of revealing some serious spoilers. But suffice it to say that this magical adventure is at its core light-hearted and joyful, even amongst all the perplexing trials and tribulations:

“That is what Miploris is: a kingdom where lone storytelling travelers come slowly wandering from all directions, dragging unwieldy luggage full of sorrow. A place where they can put it down and go back to life. And when the travelers turn back, they do so with lighter steps, because Miploris is constructed in such a way that irrespective of what direction you leave it, you always have the sun up ahead and the wind at your back. […] And in Miploris people talk of inner voices, Elsa remembers now. Miplorisians believe that the inner voices are those of the dead, coming back to help their loved ones.”



The Power of Storytelling...Fredrik Backman reminds us that storytelling is the noblest of professions, because it serves as the underlying backdrop for the ultimate journey of finding a richer understanding of ourselves, our families, our communities, and the world-at-large… Imagination becomes a currency for engaging with the ebb and flow of life. And isn’t that the way we all learn and grow? -- Not only as young children savoring fairy tales, but also as adults reading, imbibing, and re-reading all the great works of classic and contemporary literature:

“But Miamas is Granny and Elsa’s favorite kingdom, because there storytelling is considered the noblest profession of all. The currency there is imagination; instead of buying something with coins, you buy it with a good story. Libraries aren’t known as libraries but as ‘banks,’ and every fairy tale is worth a fortune.” 



(Another Family Photo of My Remarkable Grandmother)My Grandmother’s bank of priceless stories remains with me to this very day… Her kindred army of unspoken sublime utterances circle and surround our extended family each and every day, elevating even the supposedly mundane to a higher plane of existential understanding. As I continue to grow and love and learn, I feel her transcendent presence in deeply moving ways -- in all of the ongoing familial stories and interwoven personal tributes (both big and small) to her remarkable legacy… 
“We want to be loved; failing that, admired; failing that, feared; failing that, hated and despised. At all costs, we want to stir up some sort of feeling in others. Our soul abhors a vacuum...”
― Fredrik Backman, “My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry”Additional Links...Video: ""Grandma's Hands"" Alcaline, le Concert : Gregory Porter & Ben L'Oncle SoulVideo: ""Grandma's Hands"" Original Version, Written by Bill Withers (with background story)

*Strong 3.75 Stars... Although I really enjoyed how the intricate web of fairy tales in this story inspired me to relive the lasting impact of my own Grandmother's life and times, the prose fell just a little flat on my enthusiastically wanting ears."

Then I got the opportunity to listen to the audio and as the narrator sounded good I decided to give this another try.I should have listened to my gut. I like the overarching story of a grandmother telling fairy tales to her granddaughter to entertain and educate her. I also get that Elsa, as a 7 year-old have had to deal with quite a lot for such a young child. Bullying, divorced parents, a new half-sibling on the way and ultimately the death of her beloved grandmother. But I found Elsa so completely irritating it spoilt any enjoyment I could have gotten out of the story. I normally love precocious quirky children (see Be Frank With Me) but I found Elsa rude and patronising. I remember a specific scene where Elsa accused her mother of being glad that Granny died, leaving her mother in tears while Elsa still spews horrible things. The fairy tales also left me cold, and this comes from someone who loves fairy tales. I get why the author chooses to write about old people or children as they are far less guarded about what they say out loud but it just felt as if this story tried too hard. All the characters felt like overinflated caricatures of normal people.I am a fan of this author, having loved A Man Called Ove and Britt-Marie Was Here but unfortunately for me this was a disappointment.As a side note, I am glad I read this book after Britt-Marie Was Here otherwise I probably would not have read that book."

Stories of seven wonderful kingdoms that she has reared Elsa on, stories that are a way to cope, to educate, and to help Granny and Elsa and all those around them understand a world that has not treated them well. Stories about knights and princesses and villains, and majestic animals and kind-hearted monsters. And in the end I loved it, and I cried. And yes, every child needs a superhero.

Elsa é uma menina muito especial e ternurenta, que vive num conto de fadas criado pela sua Avozinha, de setenta e sete anos - o reino de Miamas, na Terra-de-Quase-Acordar -, criando uma linguagem que só avó e neta entendem.Quando a Avozinha morre, deixa uma missão à sua neta querida: entregar cartas a pessoas a quem deve um pedido de desculpas. Pessoas que a Avozinha ajudou no passado e que merecem, de algum modo, que a perdoem, permitindo a Elsa descortinar o reino criado pela Avozinha. Aqui tem início a grande aventura de Elsa, onde descobre histórias sobre o passado da Avozinha, cria amizades lindíssimas e conhece as histórias de cada um dos moradores do seu prédio, que acabam por se revelar as personagens do mundo de fantasia criado pela Avozinha.Um livro sobre sonhos, amor, amizade, família, solidão, sofrimento e perdão, que me deixou de coração apertadinho. Retrata a relação emocionante entre avó e neta, de forma deliciosa e encantadora. Uma história mágica e comovente, contada com uma pitada de humor, que me deixou agarrada desde a primeira página. Toda a gente deveria ler A minha avó pede desculpa e deixar-se ser transportado para um mundo de sonhos e fantasias, que deveriam estar mais presentes nos nossos dias, permitindo retirar uma lição muito importante: cada pessoa é especial à sua maneira, com todas as suas peculiaridades e idiossincrasias.Este foi o meu segundo livro do Fredrik Backman e seria uma excelente aposta da Porto Editora publicar os outros livros do autor, pois tenho a certeza que a leitura seria, em igual medida, tão rica, envolvente e viciante como esta. Foi maravilhoso reencontrar Britt-Marie, do livro Britt-Marie esteve aqui, que foi uma personagem muito peculiar, que me marcou muito. Sem dúvida, Backman tem muito para oferecer aos leitores!"

Are you ready for that?Elsa is 7 years old and a little different. Her Grandmother is 77 years old and the Queen of being different. Together they are best friends. Elsa's Grandmother is a fantastic storyteller and is quite gifted at creating a world of fairy tales for her and Elsa to play in. The land of Almost Awake and the Kingdom of Miamas are places where everyone is different and no one is bullied.Elsa lives with her pregnant Mother and Step Father. She sees her Father but their interactions are awkward and short lived. Elsa's peers bully her constantly and she is frequently getting into trouble and/or beat up at school. She finds a champion in her Grandmother who seems to be the only person who understands her. Elsa is devastated when her Grandmother dies. But her Grandmother isn't finished taking care of her yet, because she leaves behind a bunch of letters which she wants Elsa to deliver sending her on her most important journey yet.Through the letters she learns more about her Grandmother and the life she had before she became Elsa's Grandmother. Elsa who once felt small and alone soon learns that there are those who will rally around her, protect her and keep an eye out for her. One of my favorite parts of the book was not the fairy tale worlds but the conversation that Elsa has with her father who told her that he didn't fight for custody of her because he did not want to take her away from her Grandmother.Find more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com"
125,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7262060-diane-barnes,Rating 4 out of 5,"I can't give this one the 5 stars that ""A Man Called Ove"" rated, simply because Elsa, the 7 year old (almost 8) girl who is the star of this story strained my credulity severely. At 7, she had read all 7 Harry Potter novels ""numerous times"". She was allowed to travel around as she pleased, take city buses, and was knowledgeable about many things I'm still not sure about. I had no trouble with her cursing and precociousness, and loved her ability to teach herself anything she needed to know via Google and Wikipedia. But, it's a Swedish novel, maybe kids grow up faster there. She was a great character, along with Granny, who was definitely one of a kind. As a matter of fact, as the story progesses, we realize that everyone living in Elsa 's apartment building has an interesting, sometimes heartbreaking story, and most of them involve Granny. Who, as it turns out after her death, was much more than the teller of fairy tales and best friend of her grand-daughter Elsa. The fairy tale kingdom, ""The Land of Almost Awake"", is a large part of this story, but has it's roots in reality. Frederick Backman has an incredible imagination tied to a fair amount of writing talent. I've loved both of his books so far, and hope we get a new one before too much longer."

131,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48537771,Rating 5 out of 5,"Με το Η γιαγιά μου σας χαιρετά και ζητάει συγγνώμη, ένα από τα περισσότερο ιδιαίτερα μυθιστορήματα που έχω διαβάσει, ο Σουηδός Φρέντρικ Μπάκμαν αποδεικνύει για άλλη μια φορά πως, παρά την στερεοτυπικά επικρατούσα άποψη, οι λαοί του Βορρά διαθέτουν όση τρυφερότητα και όση φαντασία επιδεικνύουν όλες οι άλλες φυλές που παράγουν λογοτεχνία.Γνωρίζουμε έτσι τον κόσμο της Έλσα, ενός επτάχρονου κοριτσιού που είναι διαφορετικό. Πιθανώς επειδή εμφανίζει κάποιας μορφής αυτισμό (το τι την καθιστά διαφορετική δεν αναφέρεται στο κείμενο, ωστόσο πρόκειται για ένα συναισθηματικά ώριμο και πολύ έξυπνο παιδί, όπως αποδεικνύει η ίδια αλλά και όπως υπογραμμίζουν συχνά οι γύρω της), οι συμμαθητές της την αντιπαθούν και την κακοποιούν, σωματικά και λεκτικά, με αποτέλεσμα να μην έχει φίλους στην ηλικία της. Η καλύτερή της φίλη είναι η γιαγιά της, μια γυναίκα κάπως αχαλίνωτη, πολ�� εφευρετική και πολύ δυνατή για την εγγονή της, που φαίνεται πως είναι όλος της ο κόσμος. Ταξιδεύουν μαζί νοερά στα παραμύθια που σκαρώνουν παρέα, και η πραγματικότητά της, παρά το διαζύγιο των γονιών της, παρά το γεγονός ότι πρόκειται να αποκτήσει σύντομα ένα αδελφάκι από τον νέο σύντροφο της μητέρας της που στην ουσία δεν το θέλει και παρόλο που στο σχολείο καταπιέζεται, γίνεται υποφερτή.Όλη της η ζωή αλλάζει όταν η γιαγιά της χάνει την μάχη της με τον καρκίνο, κι έρχεται αντιμέτωπη με την θλίψη και την μοναξιά. Ωστόσο, επειδή η γιαγιά της ήταν λάτρης της περιπέτειας και των παραμυθιών, της αφήνει ένα ιδιότυπο κυνήγι θησαυρού με στόχο να παραδώσει κάποια γράμματα, μέσα από τα οποία απολογείται σε όλους όσους απογοήτευσε, στους ενοίκους της πολυκατοικίας όπου κατοικούσαν. Αυτό έχει ως αποτέλεσμα η Έλσα να αρχίσει να αποκωδικοποιεί τα παραμύθια που μοιράζονταν και να ανακαλύψει τι είδους άνθρωπος ήταν η γιαγιά της, αλλά και να γνωρίσει για πρώτη φορά τους ανθρώπους με τους οποίους γειτόνευε σε όλη της την ζωή. Από την στρίγκλα Μπριτ-Μαρί έως και τον σκύλο μάχης του ισογείου, που έμενε μόνος του, όλοι είχαν μια θέση στα παραμύθια.Η ιστορία είναι κάπως γλυκόπικρη. Το κοριτσάκι που για πρώτη φορά έρχεται αντιμέτωπο με την απώλεια αλλά και όλα τα άλλα που βιώνει παράλληλα αποδίδεται με μεγάλο συναισθηματισμό παρά την λεπτή λιτότητα της αφήγησης, που το ύφος της είναι όπως θα ήταν και ενός μικρού παιδιού. Η πραγματικότητα όπως δίνεται μέσα από τα μάτια ενός επτάχρονου κοριτσιού είναι πολλές φορές αποστομωτικά ειλικρινής και αιφνιδιάζει με την ακρίβεια της σκέψης και της αντίληψης που αντιστοιχούν πράγματι με την ηλικία του παιδιού, και όσο διαβάζει κανείς είναι σχεδόν αδύνατο να μην θυμηθεί ποιες ήταν οι δικές του σκέψεις και οι δικές του εντυπώσεις για τον κόσμο όταν βρισκόταν στην ηλικία της Έλσα. Οι λέξεις, οι εκφράσεις, οι σκέψεις και οι εξηγήσεις είναι επιλεγμένες πολύ προσεκτικά για να ταιριάζουν στις εμπειρίες και στα χρόνια της αφηγήτριας, και το αποτέλεσμα είναι πολύ γλυκό και πολύ συγκινητικό, γιατί μέσα από την Έλσα θυμάται κανείς τον εαυτό του.Το χιούμορ είναι πολύ εφευρετικό και καταλήγει ξεκαρδιστικό σε ορισμένες περιπτώσεις. Οι χαρακτήρες είναι απολαυστικοί, κυρίως του Αλφ, ενός ταξιτζή που αγαπάει τις βρισιές και τον καφέ - τόσο, που τον προσφέρει ακόμη και σε παιδιά και σκύλους -, και της γιαγιάς, που έχει πάντα εξαιρετικές δικαιολογίες για τα πάντα. Ακόμη και ο σκύλος έχει προσωπικότητα! Το κυνήγι του θησαυρού, δε, που το βιώνει μαζί και ο αναγνώστης μέσα από τα μάτια της Έλσα, είναι εξίσου συγκινητικό με όλα τα υπόλοιπα στοιχεία του μυθιστορήματος. Οι λεπτομέρειες του παραμυθιού της Έλσα και της γιαγιάς της κουμπώνουν όμορφα και παραπέμπουν σε χαρακτήρες που γνωρίζουμε όσο το κοριτσάκι παραδίδει τα γράμματα, και η κάθε συνειδητοποίηση είναι γλυκιά και στενόχωρη μαζί. Ο καθένας έχει την ιστορία του, που δεν είναι όμορφη πάντοτε, κι όλα δένουν μεταξύ τους με τους πιο αναπάντεχους και τρυφερούς τρόπους.Το μόνο που ξενίζει λιγάκι είναι το πώς οι περισσότεροι ενήλικες της ιστορίας είναι κάπως άκαμπτοι, άνευροι μάλλον, όμως αυτό πιθανώς πηγάζει από το γεγονός ότι τα ηνία της αφήγησης κρατάει ένα παιδί· ο κόσμος των ενηλίκων είναι άγνωστος στην Έλσα, γι' αυτό και δεν μπορεί να τους καταλάβει. Όπως και να 'χει, ακόμη κι αυτό προσδίδει στην συνολική εικόνα της ιστορίας.Εν πολλοίς, το Η γιαγιά μου σας χαιρετά και ζητάει συγγνώμη είναι ένα πραγματικά όμορφο μυθιστόρημα, που προβληματίζει σχετικά με την παιδική ηλικία, την απώλεια, την ειλικρίνεια και την δύναμη για συγχώρεση όταν ερχόμαστε αντιμέτωποι με τα λάθη όσων αγαπάμε. Όπως υπόσχεται, προκαλεί γέλιο και συγκίνηση ακόμη και στους πιο απαιτητικούς αναγνώστες."

Nu am resimțit aceleași sentimente precum în cazul poveștii lui Ove, dar mi-a plăcut mult și cea a Elsei și a bunicii sale. Și nu uita, toți copiii au dreptul de a avea supereroi și de a fi diferiți. “Elsa e genul de copil care a învăţat devreme că e mai uşor să te descurci în viaţă dacă îţi alegi singur coloana sonoră.”“Elsa ştie că-i „altfel”.

Unii îi vânează doar pe copiii care trădează că le e frică. Alţii hărţuiesc de plăcere, nici măcar nu-şi lovesc victimele când le prind, vor doar să le vadă spaima din privire. Şi mai sunt cei ca băiatul cu care s-a bătut Elsa, când fiecare voia să fie Omul-Păianjen, cei care atacă din principiu, doar pentru că nu suportă să fie contrazişi. Mai ales contrazişi de cei care sunt altfel.”“Ca s-o înveţe că nu toti monştrii sunt monştri de la bun început şi nu toţi arată ca nişte monştri.

Căci unii îşi poartă monştrii înăuntrul lor.”“Toate inimile s-au frânt şi toate oglinzile s-au sfărâmat în ziua în care s-a născut Elsa. Valul le-a spulberat cu o asemenea forţă, încât cioburile s-au răspândit în toată lumea. Catastrofele neverosimile stârnesc în oameni lucruri neverosimile - tristeţe neverosimilă, curaj neverosimil. Şi mai multă moarte decât simţurile omeneşti pot cuprinde.”“Pentru că, atunci când iubeşti foarte mult o persoană, e foarte greu să te obişnuieşti s-o împărţi cu altul.” “Există mai multe feluri de singurătăţi, iubito.”“Tu şi tata v-aţi despărţit fiindcă s-a terminat iubirea?”“Ca un ceas care funcţionează, dar arată mereu ora greşită?”“Pentru că nimeni nu te înţelege când ai aproape opt ani. Sau orice altă vârstă.”“Şi e mai uşor să nu-ţi fie frică de umbre în întuneric atunci când vorbeşte cineva, despre orice.” “Dar e megagreu să fii supărat pe cineva care-i gata să fie terorist de dragul tău. Şi atunci Elsa e furioasă că nu poate fi furioasă.”“ Pentru că adevăratul dar e să-i poţi da cuiva o carte bună, nu să primeşti, iar asta-i o chestie de bază, pe care o ştie oricine. Dacă nu-i un capsec, bineînţeles.”“Pentru că, dacă taci, n-ai cum să dezamăgeşti pe nimeni.”“Nu vrea să i se amintească faptul că bunica era singurul ei prieten, dar că ea avea sute de alţi prieteni. Nu vrea să împartă cu nimeni nici viaţa, nici moartea bunicii.”“Căci, dacă suficient de mulţi sunt altfel, nimeni nu mai trebuie să fie „normal”.”“Elsa hotărăşte că oamenii care-i plac trebuie să-i placă mai departe, chiar dacă au fost dobitoci mai demult. Că altfel se termină cam repede oamenii din jurul tău dacă-i descalifici pe veci pe toţi cei care s-au purtat ca nişte dobitoci cândva.”“Căci, dacă suficient de mulţi sunt altfel, nimeni nu mai trebuie să fie „normal”.”"

""Promise you won't hate me when you find out who I've been""


A Full Five Stars: ✰✰✰✰✰
Every time I pick up a book by Fredrik Backman I genuinely feel like I am becoming a better person for having read it. And I really mean that. There's something special about the way that he writes, in which he can take a story that might seem or sound bland and uninteresting and somehow make it into a book that is beautiful, funny, and exciting all at once. If I could try to pin point the one element in this book that accomplished that for me, it would be this: Compassion. Backman never shows us a bad guy without making you feel deeply the pain that they have had to bear, making you understand how they got there. He will make you completely indifferent to one character at the beginning, and later show these people in a different light that makes you feel awful for ever having disregarded them. He often even brings in characters who appear to be entirely good - even angelic - and then later shows how even the most perfect person can be broken just like the rest of us. This just gets to me, because this isn't only true in a book. It's true in real life, too. The people we meet are always more than meets the eye - each one having their own individual successes and failures, things they're proud of and things they deeply regret. But few people writes stories in that way. I remember there was an old lady who lived next to me and Lily for awhile. She was constantly complaining about us (where we parked, how we put out our garbage cans, the fact that we left our porch light on, ect... It was honestly very frustrating haha). She was the kind of person that would be very tempting to write off as the ""mean old lady next door"". There was one day, though, in the winter, when we got hit with a really bad snow storm. I went out to shovel and after finishing my driveway, I looked over and saw her having a hard time getting through the heavy snow. So I went over and shoveled with her, and we talked for probably an hour while we dug her out. I found out that her and her husband used to be singers and musicians, and that they made their living singing at small gigs and restaurants. I found out that she has three kids that she loves dearly. That her husband must have died recently, because she only referred to him in the past tense. That her kids so rarely come to see her, and she is very alone. I heard her laugh for the first time while she told me stories about her life, and asked me questions about mine. And I was reminded that there is so much more to the people we meet than we probably ever realize. Just like there is a lot more to *you* than you would ever normally show to people. I don't think I would have ever gone over and had that conversation with her if I had never read A Man Called Ove. This book was another amazing story, with beautiful writing, and full of compassion and heart. Can't recommend it enough."
134,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15165917-david-eppenstein,Rating 5 out of 5,"I read this author's book A Man Called Ove and loved it. I discovered this book accidentally and thought I'd give it a try since ""Ove"" was so good. After reading this book for a while I started to think I'd made a mistake. The author very cleverly and ably weaves a story based in the real world with the fantasy of a fairy tale. While it is very well written I thought the book was really intended for young adult readers and not my cup of tea. But I had started reading the book and I'm the type of person that likes to finish what he starts unless it becomes impossible. I continued to read and I was proven to be in error. The story is about a little girl named Elsa that is 7, almost 8. To say she is precocious doesn't quite cover it. She is ""different"" as the author describes her. She lives with her divorced mother and her live-in boyfriend and her grandmother lives in the same apartment building. Elsa is bullied at school for being ""different"" so her one and only friend is her grandmother. The grandmother is an eccentric retired humanitarian surgeon who fills Elsa's loneliness with a fantasy world of their mutual creation. The grandmother dies of cancer and after her death Elsa learns that her granny has set out a treasure hunt for her. The hunt is more of a series of challenges in a quest. The major portion of the book involves this quest and the discoveries Elsa makes along the way. The author has done a magnificent job of weaving reality with fantasy and, in fact, reminds us that all the fairy tales and nursery rhymes we learned as children all had a basis in reality. All of these stories were based on events that existed in the real world. These events were exaggerated, enhanced, and colored to mask the moral they were meant to illustrate and convey but they had reality at their cores. This author's story is marvelously charming and touching and reveals the author as a true story teller and one I intend to follow. The author has also maybe hinted that if we look at our lives in just the right way we might see the fantasy that surrounds us and if we live our lives correctly then maybe we'll have the happy ending that all good fairy tales are supposed to have."

My one friend described this as Backman's weakest for him so I went into with an open mind but still crossing my fingers basically. Not his best but still a pretty good book. I loved how everything was connected and fell around Elsa's granny basically (minor spoiler, maybe? Not sure). She had me laughing quite a few times and wishing I could know her in real life. She was quite a lady, warts and all.Elsa did seem unreal at times but it never took me away from the story or my enjoyment of her character. Although  her argument about ebooks had me twitching a bit. I read on ebooks but not very much as I do physical books.. I prefer the latter because it's easier for me to focus.And for someone who gets migraines, reading on a e-reader (tried once, took it back after a few tries)/phone/computer) for longer periods isn't an option always (at least for me).Digressing haha but oh well... also Elsa's reliance at times on Wikipedia and perfect grammar could get annoying but minor annoyances. When the Wurse died it broke my heart :( Kent: still a douchebag.. not gonna change my mind on that.Britt-Marie: I love how Backman has you thinking about her one way at the beginning then by the end you understand her more and just want to give her a big hug. (If you read Britt-Marie's book before this, you already know what's happening and where she's going but it doesn't ruin all the fun)We get to know each of the residents as Elsa goes on her adventure... some more heartbreaking than others.

This is a grandchild’s ultimate privilege: knowing that someone is on your side always, whatever the details. Even when you are wrong. Especially then, in fact.”I am seeing a trend in Fredrik Backman's books. In a 'A Man Called Ove', Ove is at first disliked by most of his neighbors being a grumpy old man but as the story progresses, he becomes well loved by everyone because he is able to significantly help their lives one way or another. The same is true for My Grandmother Asked You to Tell Me She's Sorry. Except in this book, Granny's heroism not only in her grandchild’s life but in many other lives as well is realized by her almost eight year old overly precocious grandchild, Elsa, after granny passed away. As Elsa embarks on the quest assigned to her by Granny before she died, Elsa learns that every person living in their apartment building has been significantly helped by Granny. It's certainly a creative, inclusive, heartwarming, and touching story that will make you laugh and cry a little too. It has a complete cast of characters, from a little girl to an ancient but hip granny, to a beast of a dog, to a super tall monster who is afraid of germs, and the rest of the neighbors and Elsa's family. It's a story about dysfunctional families, mental health, trauma, grief, and loss, mother-daughter relationships and how you can never really know why a person behaves a certain way unless you learned about their stories. It was only a bit confusing and a little challenging to follow the plot sometimes because of the multitude of characters both in the real world and the Land-of-Almost-Awake but the messages resonated with me just the same and I think Mr. Backman wrote another clever and endearing novel in this book. I look forward to reading Britt Marie was Here."

145,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"Review My Grandmother Asked Me To Tell You She's SorryThis book is a very good book for children to adults. It tells and makes new outlook about children. This book contains a lot of messages - moral messages that are good for readers. The author is Fredrick Backman, this book is a fantasy genre. The book tells about Elsa and her grandmother who has a pleasant nature in my opinion. Elsa the 7-year-old little girl came from a broken home family, felt like leaving the real world. She felt alienated, and the people around Elsa seemed unconcerned. That's because she has a cognitive ability that is different from her friends. From this Elsa story, I fell back into the world of children. Children's world filled with questions and curiosity. Reading this book, we share the various fears and fears faced by children. At school, Elsa is often bullied by her friends. With her family, Elsa must face the reality of her divorced parents. In her home environment, Elsa has strange neighbors. Of all the problems Elsa faces, there are still many people who love her. Especially Elsa's grandmother, who uses unique and fun ways to be silly to entertain Elsa so that the sadness experienced at school. Grandma also wants to make Elsa a whole child without limiting the strengths Elsa has, so she tells the story of fairy tales and the stories in them.The part that I think is very sad when Elsa's grandmother died, even though Elsa still really needs her grandmother. Elsa still wants to tell her feeling about her experiences at school and what Elsa felt about her relationship with her step-parents. As a final request, Grandma asked Elsa to undergo a mission. Special missions that are only capable of being carried out by Elsa and can later change the way of life of anyone involved in it.In addition, our emotions are like a roller coaster when reading this novel. Feelings of annoyance, smiling, laughing to yourself, and deep sadness will be felt when reading this. Many moral messages that we can get directly from this book such as, tell us that we should not judge people from the outside because a person cannot be judged only by his appearance.I recommend you to read this book, but for kids, this book is quite heavy because not all children have read and understood fantasy stories like Harry Potter told in this book. The plot in the story is also intermittently alternating between the real world and the fairy tale world in Elsa's memory. This might make it hard for children to understand when stories change from the real world with fairy tales."
146,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2314568-steve,Rating 5 out of 5,"It’s not often that book can make me tear up and stop reading. My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry did this over and over and over! I love this book!Great writing, incredible storytelling, wonderful plot, it has it all! Super-smart, super-precocious, super-obstinate Elsa is 7 (almost 8), and is singled out by her teachers and administrators and bullied by the other kids at school for being “different”. She loves her 77-year old “little bit crazy” grandmother, her best friend and her champion. Her grandmother tells her stories from the Land of Almost-Awake and the Kingdom of Miamas ""where everybody is different and nobody needs to be normal."" Elsa has memorized all the fairy tales her grandmother told her. In one very poignant scene, Elsa realizes that her grandmother has known her for Elsa’s entire life, but she has only known her grandmother for seven (almost eight) years, and comes to the realization that she doesn’t really know who her grandmother is or what she has accomplished. This realization drives the journey and the adventure for the entire book.When her grandmother dies, she leaves behind a series of letters that Elsa must deliver to various residents of the apartment building they share, telling them that her grandmother is sorry for… something. Elsa can deliver only one letter at a time before the next letter and its recipient is revealed. As Elsa delivers the letters, she is dealing with grief and anger due her grandmother's death, her mother's busyness, her parents' divorce, her new half-sibling due to arrive soon. The story is really about what Elsa learns about her grandmother (and herself) through the contents of the letters and her journey to deliver them. Magic, heroism, tragedy, and danger in the fairytales are present and reflected in the various people Elsa meets when delivering the letters; this is the exceptional strength of the entire book.In order to truly appreciate this novel, you must understand that it is, first and foremost, a fairy tale. Instead of taking place in some far-off mythical land, it’s set in 21st century Sweden. The characters don’t get around on magnificent steeds or fight fire-breathing dragons, but drive sporty Audis, rusty Renaults, and beat up Taxis. The kingdom and its castle becomes a multi-family apartment building going co-op. The heroine is armed for her quest with only a torn Gryffindor scarf, a homemade gun that shoots cookies, and an encyclopedic knowledge of all things Marvel (Spider-Man and X-Men, especially) and Harry Potter.As I read through this book at breakneck speed, it reminded me of a couple other “modern fairy tales” (movies, in this case): Big Fish with Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney, and Lady in the Water with Bryce Dallas Howard and Paul Giamatti. Both were tales created by adults in order to allow their children to experience the magic of fairy tales instead of facing the harsh realities of “real life”.For a story full of heart-wrenching grief, this book is chock full of hope, forgiveness, and acceptance. Ultimately the fairy tales provide a poignant insight into the people in Elsa’s life, people that she comes to heavily rely on."

153,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16450117-nhi-nguy-n,Rating 4 out of 5,"Cô bé Elsa gần tròn 8 tuổi đã lớn lên bên cạnh bà ngoại – một bác sĩ về hưu – cùng những câu chuyện cổ tích của bà về xứ Mơ-màng-ngủ. Xứ sở ấy có 6 vương quốc, được đặt tên theo một ngôn ngữ mà sau này Elsa mới biết được, và các nhân vật trong các vương quốc ấy dường như được lấy nguyên mẫu từ những con người có thật ở ngoài đời. Những câu chuyện cổ tích ấy, cùng với Harry Potter, X-Men và những thứ thú vị khác mà Elsa đọc được từ Wikipedia, đã nuôi dưỡng tâm hồn, định hình suy nghĩ và con người của khác biệt của cô bé. Cho đến một ngày khi bà ngoại của Elsa qua đời vì bệnh ung thư, thì câu chuyện cổ tích ma mị nhất, hấp dẫn nhất mà cũng đau lòng nhất mới thực sự bắt đầu, với việc Elsa được bà ngoại giao cho sứ mệnh đem những lá thư chứa đựng lời xin lỗi của bà ngoại cô bé đến cho những cư dân trong tòa nhà dân sinh nơi mà bà ngoại và gia đình Elsa sinh sống.“Bà ngoại tôi gửi lời xin lỗi” là cuốn tiểu thuyết thứ ba của Fredrik Backman mà mình đọc, và mặc dù bản thân mình đánh giá nó không hay bằng “Người đàn ông mang tên Ove” và “Britt-Marie đã ở đây” mà mình đã đọc trước đó, thế nhưng không có nghĩa cuốn tiểu thuyết này không hay. Nó không giống với công thức chung của những tác phẩm mang thương hiệu Backman trước đó, ở chỗ nhân vật chính là một cô bé gái gần 8 tuổi, chứ không phải một ông già hay bà già. Thế nhưng nó vẫn là một câu chuyện đúng mác Fredrik Backman, bởi thông qua quá trình tìm ra những lá thư và gửi lời xin lỗi đến những người đã hiện diện trong cuộc đời bà ngoại – những người mà bà ngoại có lý do để xin lỗi – Elsa cùng với độc giả cũng phát hiện ra những câu chuyện, những mảnh đời, những số phận chất chứa biết bao đau đớn, dằn vặt, bất hạnh và hiểm nguy, ẩn đằng sau những vị hàng xóm quen thuộc.Đó là một cựu quân nhân bị ảnh hưởng nghiêm trọng bởi những gì anh thấy ở chiến trường, để rồi trở về với cuộc sống hàng ngày mà không còn là con người trọn vẹn như ngày xưa, luôn bị ám ảnh bởi nhu cầu ở sạch quá mức. Đó là một gia đình ông bà lão hiền lành, nhân hậu, nhưng lại bị nguyền khi có một đứa con bạo lực, bất ổn, không từ một hành động nào để giành giật lại người vợ và đứa con trai, vốn dĩ an toàn hơn và hạnh phúc hơn khi không sống gần hắn. Đó là người mẹ và đứa bé trai bị bệnh, không bao giờ nói ra một lời, nhưng luôn có cách để giao tiếp với Elsa. Đó là cô chuyên gia tư vấn và trị liệu tâm lý mặc váy đen và luôn say xỉn vì trớ trêu thay, cô không thể trị liệu cho bản thân mình thoát khỏi nỗi đau đớn luôn giằng xé bên trong cô khi cùng lúc mất đi hai đứa con trai trong vụ sóng thần Ấn Độ Dương vào ngày Giáng sinh năm 2004. Đó còn là bà Britt-Marie, nhân vật chính của cuốn tiểu thuyết “Britt-Marie đã ở đây” – hóa ra là xuất bản sau cuốn sách này – một bà già được miêu tả là khó ưa, cái thời kỳ bà vẫn còn nghĩ cho ông chồng Kent vô tâm và đang lừa dối bà. Nhưng đến phút cuối, cả Elsa và người đọc mới nhận ra Britt-Marie là một người phụ nữ đáng thương và giàu tình cảm như thế nào, một người phụ nữ luôn muốn mình được cần đến, luôn muốn người khác biết mình đã ở đây, đã sống, chứ không phải là một bà nội trợ già nua, luôn nép đằng sau cái bóng doanh nhân của một người chồng ích kỷ để rồi dễ dàng bị lãng quên như rất nhiều bà nội trợ khác… Và đó còn là mẹ của Elsa, người đã lớn lên và trải qua những năm tháng tuổi teen mà không có sự hiện diện nhiều của người mẹ - tức bà ngoại Elsa - ở bên cạnh, vì bà ngoại đã tận tâm cống hiến những năm tháng đó cho công việc làm bác sĩ phương xa của mình. Ngay cả Elsa, một cô bé chưa tròn 8 tuổi, cũng là một nhân vật với một câu chuyện cuộc đời đáng được kể ra. Em là một cô bé mỗi ngày đều phải đối mặt với bọn bạn bắt nạt trong trường, vì em quá khác biệt trong suy nghĩ và tính cách, vì em luôn đeo chiếc khăn quàng Gyffindor, vì em thông minh hơn cả khối người còn lại ngoài kia. Tác giả cũng rất thực tế khi miêu tả một cách chân thực những suy nghĩ c��a Elsa trong mối quan hệ với gia đình của mình – một cô bé nằm giữa hai gia đình mới của một cặp vợ chồng đã ly hôn. Mặc dù cả dì Lisette và dượng George – cha kế và mẹ kế của em – đều là những người tốt bụng, đáng quý, nhưng Elsa vẫn có những khó khăn của riêng cô bé khi phải học cách chấp nhận và cư xử với cha ruột cùng hai người cha mẹ mới xuất hiện trong cuộc sống của em, cũng như cả thực tế là mẹ Elsa sắp sửa sinh em Một nửa – con của mẹ và dượng George. Cuộc phiêu lưu đầy ma mị của Elsa đã dẫn dắt em khám phá ra linh sói, Tim Sói, nàng tiên biển và nàng công chúa được hai chàng hoàng tử yêu say đắm – những nhân vật của xứ Mơ-màng-ngủ nhưng đã luôn hiện hữu nơi tòa nhà dân sinh mà ông Kent đang đòi biến thành chung cư để đem bán này. Để rồi đến cuối cuộc hành trình, Elsa đã khám phá ra món quà mà bà ngoại để lại cho em, cùng ý nghĩa của tất cả mọi thứ: chuyến phiêu lưu không chỉ là cơ hội để bà ngoại nói lời xin lỗi thông qua những lá thư được Elsa tìm ra, mà nó còn là cơ hội để Elsa thấu hiểu những người hàng xóm của mình, và bắt đầu một chương mới trong cuộc sống của em – làm chị gái em Một nửa – với tất cả sự tự tin vào con người khác biệt của em – một con người can đảm và mạnh mẽ, dùng chính sự can đảm đó để chống lại bọn bắt nạt, thay vì luôn chịu trận một cách bất lực như ngày xưa, và bắt đầu xây dựng một mối quan hệ gắn bó thực sự với cha ruột và mẹ kế của mình.Câu chuyện này đã làm mình cười nhiều đoạn, và khóc ở nhiều đoạn khác. Nó không hẳn hoàn toàn là một tác phẩm mẫu mực của Fredrik Backman, nhưng nếu bạn đang trên đà tìm hiểu và đọc hết toàn bộ các tác phẩm hiện đã được xuất bản của tác giả này, đây chắc hẳn là một cuốn bạn nên đọc qua để có những cảm nhận của riêng mình."

Despite My Grandmother Asked Me To Tell You She's Sorry (a title I will hopefully never type out again!) being so well written, it's kind of a mess. Backman knows his way around a good line; he knows how to bait and switch on the reader, how to mislead and trick and it's almost always a pleasant experience. You never quite know what's going on just around the corner in a Fredrik Backman novel: his quirky style, penchant for humor, and firm grasp on tragedy always keep me on toes when reading. When reading his debut novel, A Man Called Ove, Backman made me laugh AND cry — sometimes at the same time. Good book, that one was. This one? Not so much. The story revolves around Elsa, an extremely precocious girl of seven who lives in an apartment complex with people of various ages and backgrounds and circumstances, including her mom and granny. Elsa is bullied at school and Grandmother is her only friend. Said grandmother dies (this isn't a spoiler; it's in the synopsis) and sends Elsa on a special mission: to deliver various letters to their neighbors with . . . well, apologies inside. Elsa gets to know her neighbors in a way she never did before. Her granny has a special connection with all of them, and it's the unraveling of the mysteries of the relationships that drives the novel. In addition to the letter-delivering plot, there's another layer to this story: the fantastical world Granny and Elsa shared. Granny, being an extremely imaginative sort, created a world (well, six worlds to be exact) based on real life and her fellow tenants — as well as her experiences as a traveling nurse in her earlier years. Fantasy and realism mix in Elsa's mind, and it's to the world Granny created that Elsa often escapes when real life becomes too much to handle. I'll be blunt: I'm not big on fantasy. It's just not my thing. If you dig it, you'll probably like this novel more than I did. Personally, I felt the fantasy stuff got in the way and clogged the machine. It takes up a good deal of the first 150 pages or so, and I almost gave up reading it altogether multiple times. Backman's fantastical world isn't very easy to imagine or mentally explore, and I felt no connection to it; therefore, I felt no personal connection to Elsa or her grandmother because their fantasy world (called Land-Of-Almost-Awake, if you're curious) is literally all the two talk about. As well, everything that spools out as the novel progresses has roots in said fantasy. My mind just couldn't go there. Sad day for me, I guess. It's really unfortunate that I couldn't submerse myself into the fantasy world because some of the characters Backman has created are pretty fascinating — especially Britt-Marie, whom is the focus of another novel by this author which I will be reading soon after the new year begins. I enjoyed uncovering how they all knew each other and what led them to be the versions of themselves Elsa knows in the present day. I loved those parts of the novel, hence my 3-star rating. It's because of that and this author's phenomenal writing that I was able to power through the snooze-inducing sections spend in the Land-Of-Almost-Awake. Oh, and don't get me started on that schmaltzy epilogue. Barf. Fredrik Backman is now . . . well, let's say 1.5 for 2. I'm excited to dig into Britt-Marie Was Here; it seems to be more in the vein of A Man Called Ove, a novel I was and am a very big fan of. This will most likely be my last Goodreads post for a few days — at least until after Christmas. Happy holidays to you and yours, gentle review reader. Get off this site, drink some damn eggnog, and spend time with loved ones."
156,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28831526-jean,Rating 5 out of 5,"I’m happy to report that my inner child is still ageless. – James Broughton, poetThat quote is how I felt when I read Fredrik Backman’s marvelous story, 
My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She’s Sorry
. For the first seventeen pages or so, I giggled. I chuckled. I laughed out loud. Seven, not-quite-eight-year-old Elsa and her granny were a hoot! Elsa is a clever, brilliant, fine – I’ll say it – precocious – child. Her grandmother is also quite intelligent. She is a former surgeon from back in the day when women just did not become doctors. She traveled the world saving lives. Now she does what she wants and says what she wants, and she doesn’t give a darn what others think. And, oh, she is a lousy speller. But she loves her granddaughter dearly. When she travels now, she travels in her stories with Elsa to the Land-of-Almost-Awake.Granny has given Elsa a special gift. She has told her fairy tales to feed her imagination. Elsa is different from the other children in her class. She loves words. She reads. She heroes are Harry Potter and Spiderman. Because she is different, she is the victim of bullying. This is extremely sad. But she takes refuge in her granny and their adventures together. Elsa’s mother has an important job at a hospital and is a perfectionist. Together with Elsa, she lives with her partner George, who is always cooking eggs. Mom is pregnant with George’s child, “Halfie.” Love that. Dad is in the picture, too, and he always seems ill at ease around his little girl. He plays terrible music that Elsa hates, but at least he has given her the love of words. And I loved seeing these relationships evolve.Early on, Granny dies and leaves Elsa with an important task. It becomes like a treasure hunt. She must deliver a number of letters to people whom granny wished to apologize to. In the process, Elsa learns about her grandmother, her mother, and about her neighbors. The fairy tales become real, in a sense, because her grandmother didn’t totally make them up. Yes, some of the names of the lands are confusing, and some of the stories didn’t totally make sense to me, but overall, the lessons are what mattered.Granny had a way of getting under peoples’ skin, apparently, at least when she was elderly. But when she was in her prime, she was unstoppable. Determined. Principled. Her sense of duty to save lives knew no bounds. She knew that she was not the mother she should have been, but she makes up for it with Elsa. I couldn’t help thinking of my friend, singer-songwriter Ellis, and her song, “You Are Royalty to Me,” which she wrote for her granny. It is the same kind of relationship, one where Granny is protective, encouraging, and so much fun.I loved the other characters in this book as well: Britt-Marie, Wolfheart, Alf, the woman in the black skirt, the boy with the syndrome, Elsa’s mom, and the wurst. Each is so unique. Through them, Elsa learns about facing her fears and accepting others who are also different. She also demonstrates a wisdom far beyond her years. Elsa’s favorite superheroes are Harry Potter and Spiderman. They inspire her to look for the superhero in others. Pretty good insight for a kid.This book not only made me laugh; it made me cry. The final letter is the most touching, horrific spelling and all.Forgiveness, acceptance, love, imagination...

It's a coming of age story, but not told in the normal way. One of my most-loved parts in the book was the fairytales and how they linked to the story. Fredrik Bachman has the most amazing ability to get me crying and laughing at the same time. There were a few sentences that broke my heart - you know when you actually get that pain in your heart when you read it? I thought the supporting characters was much better developed than in Ove. I will be reading anything this author releases, and I highly recommend that you try one of his books. A poignant, but easy-reading tale about love in all its manifestations.The Story: Elsa is seven years old and different. Her grandmother is seventy-seven years old and crazy, standing-on-the-balcony-firing-paintball-guns-at-men-who-want-to-talk-about-Jesus-crazy. She is also Elsa's best, and only, friend. At night Elsa takes refuge in her grandmother's stories, in the Land of Almost-Awake and the Kingdom of Miamas where everybody is different and nobody needs to be normal. When Elsa's grandmother dies and leaves behind a series of letters apologizing to people she has wronged, Elsa's greatest adventure begins. Her grandmother's letters lead her to an apartment building full of drunks, monsters, attack dogs, and totally ordinary old crones, but also to the truth about fairytales and kingdoms and a grandmother like no other."

When someone says, ""What's your favorite book?"" to me, this is the answer I give EVERY TIME. This book is complex, it's magical, and it makes me really happy. It is a fiction but it borders on magical realism. I also feel like I cannot adequately review this book without spoiling it, so the final thing I'll say is that I hope if you are reading this review, you'll give this book a really fair chance. Your persistence will pay off."

Prisiminiau savo babytę, kuri juokdavosi iš mano užsispyrimo, kai kiti siusdavo. Prisiminiau pasakojimą, kaip būdama vos poros metų močiutei, kurios visi bijojo, ramiausiai pasakydavau ""kad tu gal jau eik namo"". Ne visiems taip, ir man to truputį gaila, nes labai aišku, kad visame kartais pamišusiame suaugusių pasaulyje būtent močiutės ir seneliai gali tapti ramybės uostu savo anūkams.Kitas dalykas, kuo paperka ši knyga - močiutė buvo visiškas chaosas, tačiau man atrodo, kad ji apie save galvojo kaip apie visiškai laisvą žmogų. Jos laisvė kainavo, nes būti savimi visada kainuoja. Ir nors ne viskas, ką ji darė, buvo vien gera ir teisinga, tačiau tą darydama ji norėjo gero ir teisingo.

Ir tai, KAIP rašo. Tai, kaip paprastus dalykus pateikia nepaprastai, tai, kad vienu sakiniu moka priversti šypsotis, kitu - pripildo akis ašarų. ⠀⠀Knyga pasakoja apie beveik aštuonmetę Elsą, jos velnių priėdusią močiutę ir spalvingą daugiabučio gyventojų kompaniją. Kadangi tai jau trečia perskaityta autoriaus knyga, žinau, kad visi keisti ir labai skirtingi veikėjai čia vaidins svarbų vaidmenį. Šį kartą, mažai mergaitei teks juos suburti drauge, kad išsiaiškintų močiutės paliktas užuominas ir išsiaiškintų visai nepasakiškas pasakų paslaptis.⠀⠀Knygos veikėjai labai įdomūs - Elsa, septynmetė, protu ir požiūriu į pasaulį, lenkianti suaugusius šviesmečiais, močiutė - ekstrentriška moteriškė, dažnai besielgianti kaip vaikas. Tyleniai, čia sugeba atlikti kosminius žygdarbius, garsieji - moka tik burbėti ir leisti gyvenimą vėjais. ⠀⠀Vaiko akimis, autorius puikiai atsleidė visai nevaikišką realybę, palietė svarbias temas - depresiją, potrauminio streso sindromą, tėvų skirybas, sudėtingus tarpusavio santykius. Priminė, kad niekada neverta apie žmogų, kaip ir knygą, spręsti iš viršelio.⠀⠀Gal tik pasakos, šį kartą buvo per daug. Vietomis imdavau nuobodžiauti, bet vėliau supratau, kad be jos, visas knygos grožis, nebūtų atsiskleidęs.⠀⠀Nors ši knyga nepralenkė ""Gyveno kartą Uvė"" ir ""Nerimo žmonės"", širdį pakuteno. Paskutinius puslapius užtverčiau ašarotomis akimis. Ir nuoširdžiai pavydėdama Elsai močiutės ❤️"

The currency there is imagination; instead of buying something with coins you buy it with a good story. Libraries aren’t known as libraries but as ‘banks’ and every fairy tale is worth a fortune”My Grandmother Sends Her Regards and Apologises is the second novel by Swedish blogger, columnist and author, Fredrik Backman. As with his previous bestseller, this book is flawlessly translated by Henning Koch. Every seven-year-old girl needs a superhero of their own, and Elsa (almost eight) has one: her grandmother. Unfortunately, Granny has cancer and dies just a few days before Christmas and Elsa’s eighth birthday, leaving her rudderless. But before she left, Granny charged Elsa with a mission: a treasure hunt of sorts, involving letters of apology to be delivered to some of the many people Granny has offended over the years. Elsa may feel overwhelmed by her task, but Granny made her a knight in the Land-of-Almost-Awake, so she tries to be brave and fearless. And after a while, Elsa realises that Granny has equipped her with what she needs to face the future without her. Backman has peopled his novel with a wonderful cast of characters, often quirky yet familiar and appealing for all their faults and imperfections. The banter between the characters is enjoyable and often laugh-out-loud funny. Backman’s plot is so cleverly devised that the reader can see events from the perspective of a seven (nearly eight) year old who believes in the fantasy world her granny has created for her, and from the point of view of the adults around her. And that fantasy world, the Land-of-Almost-Awake, is a wonderful thing in itself, with its parallels in the lives, loves and losses of the real-world characters. Backman given his characters many words of wisdom and insightful observations: “People who have never been hunted always seem to think there’s a reason for it. ‘They wouldn’t do it without a cause, would they? You must have done something to provoke them.’ As if that was how oppression works” and “…sometimes the safest place is when you flee to what seems the most dangerous” and “When it comes to terror, reality’s got nothing on the power of imagination” are examples. He also gives Elsa some excellent retorts to adult statements: for ‘It’s complicated.’ Elsa has ‘Yes, until someone explains it to you!’ and for ‘It’s hard to help those who don’t want to help themselves’ she cleverly objects ‘Someone who wants to help himself is possibly not the one who’s most in need of other people’s help’.Backman’s second novel is another winner, and readers will be eager to know what he can come up with next. Funny, sad and truly heartwarming. "

She loves Spider Man and Harry Potter. She is precocious. Luckily she has a wonderful and crazy grandmother who encourages her differences, creates a fairy tale kingdom to help her cope and is fiercely protective of her. The grandmother is someone you want in your corner. She even stands on her balcony, dressing gown undone, shooting paintballs at people. Elsa's parents are divorced and her mother is pregnant with her new husband, George. Her father is remarried and lives with her new wife's children. Elsa is understandably concerned about the new baby and her place in the family. So the grandmother transports her to the Land-Of-Almost-Awake and the Kingdom of Miamas and gives her the courage to cope through fairy tale stories. Elsa's grandmother dies and leave her a series of letters apologizing for various things and gives Elsa the quest of delivering them. Through this quest, Elsa meets a wide variety of people and learns a great deal about her wonderful, whacky grandmother and the entire family.  A wonderful book by a Swedish author who wrote A Man Called Ove. This is a delightful story that reminds you just how special grandparents are. I know.

Nosi jednu jaku poruku,  da nije smak svijeta biti drugačiji (posebno u ovom vremenu kada smo počeli da se ponašamo kao ovce), da naučimo već jednom da svi imamo mane, i da to nije nikakav bauk.

Više smrti nego što čovečiji um može da prihvati.Čudnovato je koliko blizu stanuju ljubav i strah.Najveća snaga smrti ne sastoji se u tome što ljude može da navede da umru, već u tome što one koji ostaju živi može navesti da izgube želju za životom.Ako dovoljno dugo gledaš dole u ambis, i ambis će se zagledati u tebe.Kada tako dugo živiš u tami strašno je teško da ne poželiš da veruješ u bajke.Čovek želi da ga vole, a ako to nije moguće, onda da mu se dive, a ako to nije moguće, onda da ga se plaše, a ako ni to nije moguće, da ga preziru i gade ga se.

Elsa's grandmother has always regaled her with fairy tales from the Land-of-Almost-Awake, and when her grandmother dies, she leaves behind a treasure hunt for Elsa. As Elsa proceeds on her adventure, she starts to realize that her grandmother's fairy tales and their real lives are much closer than anyone would have guessed.There are so many amazing things about this book. The world that is the Land-of-Almost-Awake is complex and well-thought-out. The blending of that make-believe world with the real world is seamless and masterful. We meet lots of interesting characters who evolve as the story progresses. And the story is touching and uplifting without being cheesy.As with other books I've read by Backman (A Man Called Ove and Britt-Marie Was Here), it takes a while for the story to pick up, so the first few chapters seem a bit slow. And there's a lot of information to take in about all the fairy tales. But don't let that discourage you. All the relevant info you need will be repeated later. If you press on, you will be richly rewarded."

Elsa is bullied at school and her parents have divorced. She recalls her grandmother’s stories in the Land-of-Almost-Awake and the Kingdom of Miamas, which help her deal with her fears. She interacts with people and beasts in her apartment building, delivering messages of apology on behalf of her grandmother. This book will require a rather large suspension of disbelief, since there are few, if any, young children with the mental capacity exhibited by Elsa. All primary people and magical creatures are provided a backstory, and these are interrelated. I liked it but have enjoyed others of Backman’s books more, such as A Man Called Ove, Britt-Marie Was Here, and Beartown."

Svatko tko se s tim ne slaže, nije baš čist u glavi.Elsa ima sedam godina i često ju drugi, pogotovo u školi, nazivaju 'drukčijom'. Neko bi drugo dijete možda ovo shvatilo kao nešto negativno, ali Elsu je njena superjunakinja davno naučila da je biti drugačiji jednostavno super kul. Kao da imaš vlastitu supermoć.Spomenuta superjunakinja ujedno je i Elsina najbolja prijateljica: njena Bakica. Bakica ima sedamdeset i sedam godina i često ju nazivaju 'živahnom za svoju dob'. Neki bi pomislili da to znači da je Bakica pomalo luckasta ili čak potpuno luda, ali Elsa zna da, ako i jest, luda je na najbolji mogući način.Bake i djedovi nešto su najbolje na svijetu. Oni nas čuvaju, igraju se s nama, pomažu nam odrasti i dopuštaju nam sve ono što nam roditelji inače brane. Domovi baka i djedova mjesta su na kojima smo odrastali i provodili polovicu djetinjstva. To su posebna mjesta, puna avantura i onih najboljih sjećanja i uspomena.'Kuće baka su nešto posebno. Zauvijek upamtiš njihov miris.'Imati baku i djeda genijalna je stvar. Oni su tvoje utočište, tvoja sigurnosna mreža kada ti život postane malo prenaporan i moraš se nekamo sakriti. Čak i ako su luckasti, šašavi ili mušičavi, tvoji su - i znaš da su tu za tebe, čak i kad si i sam luckast, šašav ili mušičav (a ponekad i sve to skupa).'Kad imaš baku, to je kao da imaš cijelu vojsku. To je najveći privilegij unuka - znati da je netko na tvojoj strani, uvijek i bez obzira na sve. Čak i kad si u krivu. Zapravo, pogotovo tada.'Ono o čemu kao klinac uopće ne razmišljaš, je to da su tvoji baka i djed imali život i prije nego što su postali baka i djed. A ponekad - zapravo, vrlo često - ti o tom životu ne znaš baš ništa.'Moguće je voljeti svoju baku godinama, a da zapravo o njoj ne znaš ništa.'Kad Elsina Bakica umre, Elsa u zadatak dobije dostaviti Bakičina pisma određenim ljudima. Pisma su to u kojima se Bakica ispričava, a ljudi kojima Elsa treba pisma dostaviti Elsu iznenade - jer Elsa nema ni najmanjeg pojma zašto bi se Bakica imala baš tim ljudima ispričavati. Ispunjavajući zadatak koji joj je Bakica namijenila, Elsa otkriva detalje iz Bakičinog života o kojima nije imala pojma. Neki ju od tih detalja iznenade, neki rastuže, a neki pak naljute. Svejedno, Elsa Bakicu ne namjerava iznevjeriti i planira izvršiti svoj zadatak do kraja - kamo god ju to odvelo.Bakičina pisma Elsu će odvesti u nepredvidivu pustolovinu, u kojoj će doznati stvari o Bakici koje do tada nije znala, ali će ujedno doznati i štošta o ljudima oko sebe: svojoj majci, ocu, očuhu, susjedima. Elsa će sve te ljude vidjeti na jedan posve nov način, otkriti kako su svi oni povezani s njenom Bakicom, a naći će i neke neočekivane prijatelje: jednog volkonja i jedno Čudovište, za početak.Ono što nam Elsina priča sjajno prikazuje je to kako možeš čitav život živjeti s nekim ili pored nekog, bez da tu osobu uopće upoznaš. Čitavog života možeš prolaziti pokraj susjeda kojeg smatraš pijanicom, ili zabadalom, ili luđakom, ili čudovištem, bez da se uopće potrudiš provjeriti zašto si mu nadjenuo baš taj epitet i što iza njega stoji. Ova priča nam sjajno pokazuje kako ljudi oko nas nisu uvijek onakvi kakvima nam se čine: svatko od njih ima svoju vlastitu priču, vlastitu tajnu, koju bi nam možda čak i rado otkrio - samo ga nikada nismo ni pitali.'Ne izgledaju sva čudovišta kao čudovišta. Neka od njih nose svoju čudovišnost u sebi.'Ono o čemu ova knjiga zapravo govori je kako se nositi sa smrću nekoga koga voliš, pogotovo kada ti je tek sedam godina. I odraslima je teško pojmiti gubitak voljene osobe, djeci je sve to još teže i podnijeti i shvatiti. Način na koji se Elsa nosi s Bakičinom smrću sjajno je opisan u ovom romanu: Elsa je, naravno, tužna, ali je vrlo često i ljuta - na sebe, na druge, na Bakicu.'Teško je pojmiti smrt. Teško je pustiti nekog koga voliš.'Svaka priča mora imati neku pouku. Tako barem misli Elsa. A pouka ove priče (odnosno jedna od, koja mi se jako svidjela) genijalna je: ljudi su (uglavnom) govna. A cilj svačijeg života trebao bi biti taj da se trudiš biti što manje govno, a što više negovno. U tome je cijela stvar.'Katkad bi Elsa znala pitati bakicu zašto odrasli uvijek rade takve idiotske stvari jedni drugima. Bakica je uglavnom odgovarala da je to zato što su odrasli obično ljudi, a ljudi su obično govna. Elsa je smatrala da su odrasli, između svih tih svinjarija, zaslužni i za hrpu dobrih stvari - recimo za istraživanje svemira, UN, cjepiva, noževe za sir. Bakica je tumačila kako pravi trik leži u tome da gotovo nitko nije potpuno govno i da gotovo nitko nije potpuno negovno. Teška stvar u životu je zadržati što je više moguće ove negovnaste strane.'Druga pouka ove priče je: i superjunaci, u stvarnom životu, umiru.'U cijeloj ovoj priči problem je s junacima koji bi na kraju priče trebali ""živjeti sretno do kraja života"". Tu postaje zeznuto, iz narativne perspektive, jer ljudi koji dođu do kraja života moraju ostaviti one koji moraju do kraja života živjeti bez njih. Jako je teško biti onaj koji živi do kraja života bez njih.'Trik je, kod smrti, taj da ju prihvatiš kao dio života, a onoga koga si izgubio održiš živim u svojim sjećanjima, uspomenama, pričama koje ćeš o njemu pričati. Jer, da parafraziram jedan citat, na kraju ćemo svi postati priče. A kod tih priča važno je da se zapamte one dobre - one koje će nas podsjećati na osobu koje više nema, koje ćemo pričati sa smiješkom i pamtiti s toplinom u srcu.'U Zemlji Gotovo Budnih nikad ne kažete zbogom. Samo kažete ""vidimo se kasnije"". Ljudima u Zemlji Gotovo Budnih to je važno jer vjeruju da ništa nikad zapravo ne umire. Samo se pretvori u priču, dođe do malog pomaka u gramatici i vrijeme se promijeni iz ""sad"" u ""nekad"". Sprovod može trajati tjednima, jer su rijetke prigode u životu bolje za pričanje priča. Naravno da su prvog dana to uglavnom priče o tuzi i gubitku, ali kako dani i noći odmiču, tako se pretvaraju u priče koje ne možete ispričati a da ne puknete od smijeha. (...) A Miamašani se smiju toliko glasno da se priče uzdižu poput lanterni iznad groba. Sve dok sve priče i sva vremena ne postanu jedno. Smiju se dok svi ne zapamte da je sve što ostavljamo iza sebe kad nas više nema - smijeh.'"

Always. In the best way. I first discovered Backman when I received an ARC of Beartown in early 2017 and I'm really not exaggerating when I tell you my life was changed. Beartown was my favorite book of 2017 and also earned its place on my all-time favorite list. Next, came Ove, which was admittedly my least favorite of Backman's books, then I read both novellas and around that time, I started to realize that the beauty of Backman's story is his words. Now, I know you might think, isn't that true of all authors? But, no. Some write wonderful plots, some write well developed characters, but the beauty of Backman is his prose. Now, to the point...My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry is quite different from Backman's other books in that it's largely told in a fantasy setting, but still packs the same punch as his other books. I loved Elsa, Granny and all the others and I know you will too!Now, the only outstanding Backman book for me is Britt-Marie Was Here and I want to read it right now but I also don't want to not have any left to read!!! (And I've already read an ARC of Us Against You - #decisionsdecisions #bookwormproblems "

Não há história nenhuma dele, até agora, que não me derreta o coração, que não me agarre.Neste caso, temos uma prequela de Britt-Marie Esteve Aqui, outra obra do autor.Foi maravilhoso conhecer com mais detalhe o contexto do prédio onde Britt-Marie viveu. O contexto destes seres humanos (reparem que não disse personagens) que coabitaram com ela.Neste A Minha Avó Pede Desculpa conhecemos a história de Elsa, uma menina de 7 (quase 8) anos, que cresceu toda a sua curta e preenchida vida com uma avó incomparável. Uma avó que lhe deu Miamas, uma terra de sonhos que tanto tem de real.Não vos quero adiantar muito da história, mas quero dizer-vos que este é um livro de amor, de perda, e de tudo aquilo que esses dois sentimentos nos trazem.Um livro que nos mostra que não somos nada sem os outros e que todos, independentemente do nosso contexto, temos as nossa dores e sofrimentos.Uma leitura amargamente doce e simples.Gostei muito e quero ler tudo do autor. Espero que a @portoeditora traduza mais livros do Sr. Backman, senão vou mesmo lê-los em inglês.E vocês, já leram? O que acharam?"

Casos que inicialmente nada têm em comum e que aos poucos vão-se interligando como uma deliciosa teia em que é difícil não ficar-mos presos. Sem sombra de dúvidas que para mim esta leitura está na lista das melhores do ano (até agora)."

I saw SO MUCH of myself and my Gramma in this story - especially how close they were and the wonderful secrets and stories they shared together. I also saw and still see so much of myself in Elsa in her mourning - the section of Elsa talking about how ANGRY she was with her Grandmother for dying and leaving her alone really brought a tear to my eye cause I felt that too when my Gramma passed away.I also adored the magical (realism??) elements of this book SO much. It really took a pretty normal story to the next level - there are plenty of books about this same idea (example; Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close) but I think Backman made it so much better with the magic.Absolutely loved it. Highly recommend it.

Avrete a che fare con buffi individui, un intreccio di vite misteriose, mondi fantastici e altri terribilmente reali. Le vite di tutti noi sono una miscela di bene e male: bisogna saper decidere da che parte stare.Geniale, ironico ma mai comico, fantasioso, attualissimo senza darlo a vedere.

Superou as minhas expectativas, fiquei encantada com o grau de cinzentos da alma humana e com a sensibilidade com o que o autor conta a história pela perspectiva de uma menina de oito anos. Esta, nascida numa família disfuncional, mas onde pode aprender sobre o mundo e sobre ela própria, é um ser diferente, fora do padrão considerado normal e aceitável. É impossível não criar empatia pela miúda esperta que avalia melhor as pessoas e as situações que muitos adultos.

In our fragmented and self-absorbed world we tend not to pay attention to our neighbors and in many cases to our own families. Backman's novels help the reader realize how important and fulfilling these relationships can be in while telling a story through a totally unique narrative. A wonderful feel good book!

Η μόνη λέξη που μου έρχεται στο μυαλό είναι η λέξη αριστούργημα. Ένα βιβλίο που σε κάθε σελίδα του σε κάνει να κλάψεις, να γελάσεις και να συγκινηθείς.Η ""σχεδόν οχτώ"" χρονων Έλσα είναι ένα κορίτσι διαφορετικό από τα υπόλοιπα συνομήλικα της παιδιά. Για αυτό ακριβώς το λόγο έχει μάθει να τρέχει. Να τρέχει από τα πάντα. Από τους συμμαθητές της στο σχολείο που δεν μπορούν να την δεχτούν για αυτό που είναι και της κάνουν bullying. Από τους γονείς της, που είναι χωρισμένοι και νιώθει ότι δεν χωράει στις νέες οικογένειες που δημιούργησαν. Από τους μεγάλους που πιστεύει ότι δεν την καταλαβαίνουν. Η μόνη της συντροφιά είναι η γιαγιά της, που είναι και αυτή διαφορετική με τον δικό της αξιολάτρευτο τρόπο. Η γιαγιά της που έζησε τη ζωή της με τον δικό της αντισυμβατικό τρόπο και που είναι η μόνη που την καταλαβαίνει. Για την Έλσα είναι ένας σούπερ ήρωας. Η Έλσα κάθε βράδυ κοιμάται στην μαγική ντουλάπα της γιαγιάς και μεταφέρεται μέσα από τη φωνή της στη�� Μιάμας. Η Μιάμας είναι μια μαγική χώρα όπου κάθε παραμύθι και κάθε μαγικό πλάσμα ζει εκεί με τους δικούς τους κανόνες και πάντα το καλό νικάει όσο δυνατό και αν είναι το κακό που το κυνηγάει. Την ιστορία της Μιάμας, η γιαγιά την αφηγείται στην Έλσα, στην δική τους μυστική γλώσσα.Η πολυκατοικία στην οποία μένουν, το ""κάστρο"" τους όπως συνήθιζε να το λέει η γιαγιά, απαρτίζεται από διαφορετικούς ανθρώπους, οι οποίοι έχουν όλοι τους τις δικές τους ξεχωριστές ιστορίες και που όλοι τους συνδέονται με κάποιον τρόπο με την γιαγιά της Έλσας. Μια αλκοολική γυναίκα, δυο ηλικιωμένα ζευγάρια, ένας ταξιτζής (τον λάτρεψα), ένα αγόρι με κάποιο σύνδρομο με τη μητέρα του, ένα Τέρας και κάπου κρύμμενο μέσα σε αυτό το ""κάστρο"" υπάρχει κι ένας αρκουδόσκυλος.Κάποια στιγμή, δυστυχώς η γιαγιά αρρωσταίνει. Τότε αρχίζει το κυνήγι του θυσαυρού για την μικρή Έλσα. Η γιαγιά της δίνει κάποιες επιστολές, με τις οποίες ""χαιρετά και ζητάει συγνώμη"". Αυτές οι επιστολές σε συνδυασμό με τον θάνατο της γιαγιάς θα ξεκλειδώσουν αλήθειες και μυστικά. Η Έλσα θα δει ότι τα παραμύθια που σκάρωνε γι' αυτήν η γιαγιά της επεξηγούσαν το παρελθόν της και έκρυβαν την πραγματικότητα της, ίσως γιατί ένιωθε τύψεις και ενοχές. «Αύριο σε στέλνω σε ένα κυνήγι θησαυρού», της είπε λίγο πριν κλείσει τα μάτια της. «Και θα είναι ένα υπέροχο παραμύθι και μια μεγαλειώδης περιπέτεια. Και πρέπει να μου υποσχεθείς πως δεν θα με μισήσεις γι’ αυτό». Η Έλσα με συντροφιά, λοιπόν το Τέρας και τον αρκουδόσκυλο θα ξεκινήσει μια απίστευτη περιπέτεια γεμάτη με πολέμους, ναρκωτικά, τσουνάμι και έρωτες.Το αφηγηματικό ύφος του βιβλίου είναι ευφυέαστατο καθώς ο συγγραφέας χρησιμοποιεί παιδική γλώσσα κι έτσι καταφέρνει να μας μεταφέρει στο κόσμο της Έλσας όπως τον βλέπει αυτή. Οι διάλογοι ήταν απολαυστικοί. Οι χαρακτήρες ολοκληρωμένοι, ακόμα και αυτοί που περνάνε σαν ""Σκιές' από το βιβλίο. Σε κάθε σελίδα και αράδα του βιβλίου απολαμβάνουμε το χιούμορ του συγγραφέα και όμως βλέπουμε και τον ""δήθεν"" πολιτισμό, την μοναξιά και τις σχέσεις των ανθρώπων. Για την πίστη, την οικογένεια, για τον καρκίνο αλλά και την αγνή, αληθινή αγάπη. Μα πάνω από όλα σε αυτό το βιβλίο βλέπουμε την διαφορετικότητα. Για το πόσο πολύτιμος είναι ένας άνθρωπος που είναι διαφορετικός.Άλλωστε το έλεγε και η γιαγιά: ""Μόνο οι άνθρωποι που είναι διαφορετικοί αλλάζουν τον κόσμο, κανείς φυσιολογικός δεν έχει αλλάξει ποτέ το παραμικρό»."

208,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,Rating 2 out of 5,"This is the story about a precocious* child (7 going on 8), an eccentric grandmother (her death comes early in the book), and their apartment building neighbors (all with quirky histories). Characters and relationships also include the child's divorced mother and father and their current romantic partners. And as if that's not enough characters to keep track of, there's also some sort of hairy beast who's apparently a large dog but never called that (see book's cover).*The book uses the adjective ""different"" to describe her.The plot is built around letters discovered by Elsa, the child, left by her grandmother and addressed to the various apartment dwellers. Through all these adventures Elsa learns much about her neighbors, their history with her grandmother, and how their various stories interlink. As Elsa tries to make sense of these new found relationships, she tries to fit them into the imaginary world that she had shared with her grandmother. This imaginary world included their secret language which Elsa later learns is spoken by one of the mysterious neighbors. Suspense is added to the plot with the introduction of a dangerous villain. There's also a cantankerous neighbor who at first appeared to be problematic, but in the end she wasn't so bad.When Elsa's parents were first introduced in the book I anticipated that the fact that they were divorced would be developed into a problem for Elsa to overcome. As it turns out, the author portrayed their relationship as an almost ideal cooperative spirit between two ex-spouses, and it was clear that they both loved their daughter Elsa. It was sort of a relief to me as a reader when it became apparent that the story's villain was someone from outside the apartment building.I didn't enjoy this book as much as some others readers. For one thing, I'm turned off by depictions of older people (granny in this instance) with eccentric behavior bordering on juvenile (e.g. shooting a paintball gun at a neighbor). I also don't care for stories about precocious children on independent quests which in real life could be dangerous. A comparative example where I was totally turn off by such a story is described in THIS REVIEW of Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close by Jonathan Safran Foer. I had some of those same negative feelings about this book as well, but in the end I decided I could give it two stars.link to reading group guide:http://www.simonandschuster.com/books..."

The story concerns Elsa, a precocious almost 8 year old who is bullied in school. Her grandmother is her only friend. Granny, who is dying of cancer, writes a series of letters and tasks Elsa with delivering them after her death. The tale works well when it sticks to the story of Elsa delivering the letters and getting to know the various people in her apartment building and learning their history with Granny. Yes, the story may be unbelievable (Elsa is EXTREMELY precocious) but there are many sweet, humorous moments. In this sense, the book is closest to A Man Called Ove. But each chapter also veers to the fairy tales that Granny told Elsa and here, it just bored me to tears. I listened to the audio book and this was one of my first experiences with the genre. The narrator did a good job of differentiating the voices. But her voice for Elsa was so high pitched, it was difficult to hear it in a moving car. "

There is much to learn  from people at the opposite ends of life. As we also discover in his latest novella,  And Every Morning the Way Home Gets Longer and Longer,  with a boy and his grandfather. All fairy tales take their life from the fact of being different.  The power of storytelling! “Only different people change the world,” Granny used to say. “No one normal has ever changed a crapping thing.”Granny has always loved treasure hunts.  She does not color within the lines; a total disregard for social niceties. Everyone thinks she is crazy. A trouble-maker. Rip-roaring life is an adventure. A superhero for her granddaughter, Elsa. They both are misunderstood. “Because all seven-year-olds deserve superheroes. And anyone who doesn’t agree needs their head examined.”Elsa is seven years old.  Not quite eight yet. She is smarter than her years, an old soul. She is different. Her Granny is her best friend and teaches her about life through stories. Her only friend. She does not fit in at school. Intuitive, Elsa, loves her Granny. She is eccentric, her protector, and the one who tells her nightly bedtime fairy tales in their small apartment in the Land of Almost-Awake. (Miamas, Miploris, Mimovas, Wolfheart, the Chosen One, the sea-angel, etc.)“Grow up and be different and don’t let anyone tell you not to be different; because all superheroes are different.”With an array of misfits,  a neighborhood apartment full of colorful eccentric quirky witty characters. We also meet Britt-Marie (we hear more from in)  Britt-Marie Was Here. “Because if a sufficient number of people are different, no one has to be normal.”Elsa’s parents are divorced  and she spends time at both households. Her mom has remarried and currently pregnant. Granny is keeping a secret from Elsa. She has cancer. However, when she dies she is angry and alone, full of emotions. She has left her a treasure hunt. “Having a grandmother is like having an army. This is a grandchild's ultimate privilege: knowing that someone is on your side, always, whatever the details. Even when you are wrong. Especially then, in fact. A grandmother is both a sword and a shield.”Now, Elsa is left  with the task of delivering her grandmother’s final letters of apology to all other residents of the building—The Monster, a hulking, quiet germaphobe; Alf, a tough-talking, curmudgeonly cabbie; Britt-Marie, the nervous wife of a businessman (Kent), and others—whom she feels she mistreated during her lifetime. Is there a connection to her granny, her stories, neighbors, and her characters? Grief, adventure, humor, emotions, and love all collide.  Endearing and whimsical fairy tales provide a way to teach children (and adults) some fundamental truths about the world. I listened to the  Audiobook  and Joan Walker  as always, delivers a captivating performance! Hey, being a boomer, I even enjoy my seven-year-old grandson's company sometimes more than my uptight forty-year-old son. There is a bond, which often skips a generation. Of course, those are the joys of being a grandparent, when life is simpler, and not as structured.  We are wise, of course :)I enjoyed my Fredrik Backman binge read  this weekend, making my way through all his endearing and charming stories. This was my last one. Looking forward to  Beartown,  coming May 2017 (Atria Books) a poignant, charming novel about a forgotten town fractured by scandal, and the amateur hockey team that might just change everything.

218,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4417282-lee-coleman,Rating 1 out of 5,"Ugh. This book was insufferably cutesy. Some people will eat books like this up with a spoon, but I'm not one of them. Here are the top 10 spoilerish things that drove me crazy about reading this book:*****1. Books with a ""plucky"" seven year old (maybe if it is a children's book, but not an adult, chick-lit story). Plucky is too close to obnoxious and annoying. If you don't hit it right, it is a huge miss. Things like correcting an adult on their grammar or speech is not endearing. Taking care of a dog without telling your mom is not charming. Elsa is inconsistent- ridiculously confident and timid, outspoken and introverted, a runner and a fainter, forthright and secretive. I don't buy her.2. Books with a ""plucky"" hooligan grandmother, who is 77 years old, dying of cancer, but still spry enough to break the law with a 7 year old in order to cheer her up and distract her from school troubles. She resembles absolutely no real person I can think of. And even if she did, I wouldn't celebrate this personality or behavior. Again, I find this more irritating than whimsical. 3. Books where a 7 year old's best friend is her 77 year old grandmother. This is a HUGE fail for me. I'm sure this is an adorable story line for some grandmas out there who would love to have such a close relationship with their granddaughter or some Pollyanna reader who loves their grandma. But any seven year old who has no close peer friends does not make me sympathetic to the character but rather annoyed that her mother and grandmother have failed in raising her. 4. Books where everyone and everything is connected, but nobody acts like it or seems to know until the end of the book. The grandmother is responsible for bringing everyone into the apartment building, but surprisingly fails to visit any of them with her BFF Elsa and spend any time with them or help Elsa get to know their stories. Instead, she concocts this tedious series of scavenger-hunt letters for Elsa to deliver after her death to try and piece together all their relationships and stories.5. The laborious childhood fairy tales with imaginary fairy lands of sadness and bravery, which ultimately tie into the residents' personal stories. This is way more boring and convoluted than clever. And SO NOT worth the annoyance, waiting for it to all come full circle at the end. 6. The cutesy nicknames: almost-eight-year-old, wurse, lionheart, green eyes, black skirt, shadow, boy with a syndrome. Not to mention the fairy tale lands with the secret language. Somehow Elsa is fluent enough in a ""secret"" language to converse with strangers. And the grandmother doesn't bother to include her own daughter in this secret language? Please. 7. Books with overly romanticized moments that read like soap opera scenes. Elsa and her mom touching foreheads in a poignant moment of love. Elsa wiping her mother's tears with her Griffindor scarf. Elsa fainting on more than one occasion from fright. Elsa sleeping in a wardrobe for fun. Way too bubble gum for me.8.

219,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4863523-laysee,Rating 4 out of 5,"Fredrik Backman, methinks, has an affinity with old people and a talent for fashioning lovable characters out of crusty elderly folks. The curmudgeon Ove found his match in a feisty old Granny who is a superhero in more senses than one.Backman writes sympathetically about what it feels like to be Elsa, a 7-year-old girl who has challenges both at home and in school. Her parents are divorced; her ambitious surgeon mother has no time for her; a half-sibling is waiting in the wings to steal what little attention she is getting. In school, Elsa is being mercilessly bullied. However, Elsa is no angel. She is incredibly smart and precocious but also volatile, hot-tempered, obnoxious and sassy at times. Thankfully for Elsa, she has a 77-year-old Granny who believes that “every seven-year-old deserves a superhero”. Granny’s remaining years are devoted to protecting Elsa from nightmares that loom large even in the day. Granny is an amazing grandma even though she seems to hail from Planet Politically Incorrect. She can be embarrassingly inappropriate, loud, and crude. She is anti-establishment and a rebel – the kind that has cinnamon buns and beer stashed in her hospital bed. Yet Granny is a lot of fun and she loves Elsa very dearly. And because she is a smarty-pants Granny (a retired surgeon), Granny creates an alternate universe – The Land-of-Almost-Awake – and introduces Elsa to kingdoms where knights battle evil and keep shadows at bay. Granny tells stories of the golden knights who defeat fear every time Elsa is afraid. If you believe in the power of words, you can see there is method in Granny’s madness. Crazy Granny aside, there is a whole cast of similarly eccentric folks that are Elsa’s neighbors: a soldier broken by war who has OCD, a woman in a black skirt addicted to mint and alcohol, a fuzzy “wurse” that loves chocolates and cookies, etc.). Each one is fun to know. More and more about the lives of these characters is revealed when Granny sends Elsa on a mission to say sorry to each of them on her behalf. Heartbreaking tales unfold of people fighting their own demons ""because not all monsters were monsters in the beginning. Some are monsters born of sorrow."" Who says only children need superheroes?Backman’s use of language is straightforward, colloquial, and even blunt. Every now and then, he drops a line that bears a ring of truth ""..the real trick of life was that almost no one is entirely a shit and almost no one is entirely not a shit. The hard part of life is keeping as much on the not-a-shit side as one can."" Not pretty language, but it packs a punch. This one is my favorite: ""Having a grandmother is like having an army. This is a grandchild's ultimate privilege: knowing that someone is on your side, always, whatever the details. Even when you are wrong. Especially then, in fact.""As in “A Man Called Ove”, behind the jocular tone in this novel is an informed understanding of the darkness behind dysfunctional or broken lives and faith in the human capacity for forgiveness and healing."

Reikia kuo nors tikėti, kad suprastum pasakas. „Šiaip nedidelis skirtumas, kuo tikėsi, bet kažkuo tikėti reikia, kitaip gali apskritai į viską spjauti, po šimts.“ Tikriausiai vien tai ir turi būti svarbu.“Būna knygų, kurios yra tarsi Kalėdos. Kvepia cinamonu, spaudžia ašarą iš visos jaučiamos meilės ir džiaugsmo, primena išėjusius ir dėl to tik labiau norisi džiaugtis dėl tų, kurie šalia. „Močiutė perduoda linkėjimų ir atsiprašo“ – kaip tik tokia knyga. Ir nežinau kaip jums, bet man šiuo laikotarpiu labai reikėjo trupučio Kalėdų. Tiesą sakant, trupučio Kalėdų reikia visada, kai nėra Kalėdos. Fredriką Backmaną pavadinčiau Astrida Lindgren suaugusiems, nors dievaži, nesupraskit manęs neteisingai – su mielu noru Astridos knygas atsiverčiu kasmet, nepriklausomai nuo amžiaus. Abiejų autorių knygos pasižymi panašiu lengvabūdišku humoro jausmu, lengva ranka pasakojamomis sunkiomis istorijomis, ašarą spaudžiančiomis ne tik todėl, kad liūdna, bet ir todėl, kad tiesiog labai gražu. Ir visai nieko keisto verkti ir juoktis vienu metu – kartais gyvenime taip jau būna, o tiek Fredrikas, tiek Astrida tą kuo puikiausiai žino. „Močiutė perduoda linkėjimų ir atsiprašo“ – knyga apie gyvenimą, todėl joje telpa tiek daug visko – šeimyniniai santykiai, (ne)laimingos meilės, vedybos ir skyrybos, ne visada mylimi vaikai ir iš jų išaugantys pikti suaugusieji. Tikriausiai ne kiekvienam patiktų pasakų motyvai, kuriais naudodamasis F.Backmanas kalba apie labai sudėtingus ir žiaurius dalykus, tačiau jų pagalba autorius tobulai pasakoja istoriją per septynmetės prizmę – ne infantiliai, ne nuobodžiai, tačiau tuo pat metu ir ne primityviai, kaip kad kartais nutinka, kuomet suaugę bando prisiminti ką reiškia matyti pasaulį vaiko akimis. Todėl knyga, manau, tinkama visiems - kurie dar truputį jaučiasi vaikais, kurie pamiršo, ką reiškia būti vaikais, kurie nori vaikams paaiškinti sudėtingus dalykus ar kurie supranta, kad ir patys kai kurių dalykų paaiškinimų dar tik ieško. Nes jau senokai niekas man gyvenimo tiesų neaiškino taip gražiai, kaip tą daro Fredrikas Backmanas.  "

Pentru că are Backman harul ăsta, de-a scrie despre lucrurile mici, de fiecare zi, în propoziții scurte și clare, care te liniștesc și te fac să te simți în siguranță, relaxat. Dar nu te culca pe o ureche, pentru că și lucrurile mari, dramele, sunt prezentate exact la fel. Scurt și clar.

In the beginning, I thought I might not like the book, if the fairy tale portion continued. But, as the story progresses, the fairy tale weaves its way through the real life portion of the book.The characters in this book are well developed. You learn the history of each person and why they are the way they are. All of the people have been touched in some way by Elsa's granny and you learn so much about her and them as you go that you care about them as much as you do Elsa. This is a story of secrets uncovered, healing, and growth. There were definitely aspects of the book that could be considered faults and parts I didn't love, but those parts were fairly easy for me to overlook in the greater scheme of this book. Very well done story. Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for providing me with an e-copy in exchange for an honest review. "

229,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34117027-olivia-savannah,Rating 5 out of 5,"My Grandmother Asked Me To Tell You She’s Sorry was a book I fell in love with as soon as I read the title. And when it only took me two days to consume the book in its entirety, I knew I hadn’t made a bad choice. This book was wonderful, meaningful and also a really good character driven read. With beautiful descriptions to make a bookworm swoon, I was impressed that I could enjoy this book. I’m someone who doesn’t usually get along with translated books. But this book didn’t even read like one at all. In fact, I didn’t notice it was one until I actually started writing this review. So kudos to the translator who I mentioned up next to the author’s name. It was a brilliant translation. This book expertly deals with the ideals of when you think you know everything about your role model or best friend when it turns out you don’t. That’s simply because there is never enough time to tell them everything, or you don’t want them to get a bad impression of them. No matter what people say about your best friend never judging you, you have to admit that is something you worry about a little bit. Elsa realises, as she apologises to all these people on a treasure hunt, that her grandmother was not the person she believed her to be. Her role model was imperfect. But at the same times as not being who she said, she was exactly who she said she was as well. If it seems like what I’m saying doesn’t make any sense, then you should definitely try this novel to learn about what I mean!The novel also crosses a lot of themes. Elsa’s parents are divorced, and you can see her trying to handle that, as well as the fact that she is going to be having another sibling with her mother and step dad. She also has a bit of a distance with her father as he is very formal, so she tries to overcome this as well. At the same time, this novel is really about love and acceptance. Elsa’s bullied at school, so we really get to see how this has shaped who she is and affected her confidence. And lastly, I have to mention the most important theme – death. She’s doing this for her grandmother because she’s passed away. Which is so, so heartbreaking. It makes Elsa sad. It makes Elsa angry. She thinks it’s not fair, and then hates her grandmother for leaving her. It touches her emotions in so many ways that was real to me when I was a ten year old (okay, a bit older than her seven years) and my grandfather also passed away from cancer. Because it spoke to me so much and represented those twisted emotions so well, it was hard to do anything but love this book. Elsa was a brilliant character and I just loved her so much. She was a genius kid, but she was still a kid, and that was executed so well. She would spin out the most clever and intelligent things, but she doesn’t have the filter that most adults have, so it got her into trouble that way. And while she knows all these facts and common sense, she still leans heavily on her imagination and getting captured into non-existent worlds. She praises Harry Potter and superhero comics, and thinks you’re incredibly dumb if you haven’t read ‘great literature’ such as those. She’s still a child. But a genius too. The secondary characters were so amazing, and so detailed that I could write a full paragraph or maybe even essay on each of them as well. The important thing about the characters is their own stories and how this ties into who her grandmother was. As she apologises to each one, they come into the story and we learn more about them! And the best part… Is that all of their stories tie together. Even though they all seem distant, it really explains why the characters are the way they are. It all came together so clearly and perfectly by the end of the novel, that I was actually surprised. It’s like a gentle plot twist for more character driven readers. It made me laugh. It made me sad. It made me smile. This book is definitely worth your time.Gif Summary: [image error]This review and others can be found on Olivia's Catastrophe: https://olivia-savannah.blogspot.nl/2..."

Because she was a girl?..Most likely they told her a whole lot of damned things she wasn't allowed to do, for a range of different reasons. But she damned well did them all the same. A few years after she was born they were still telling girls they couldn't vote in the bleeding elections, but now the girls do it all the same. That's damned well how you stand up to bastards who tell you what you can and can't do. You bloody do those things all the bloody same."" (280)""People have to tell their stories, Elsa. Or they suffocate."" (314)My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry is a celebration of imagination, storytelling, and the power of individualism. Seven year old Elsa is an outspoken and creative Swedish girl who shares a special bond with her grandmother 70 years older than she is. Her grandma is a powerful storyteller who was created a make belief world of the ""Land of Almost Awake"" which Elsa has taken to heart as a special place to seek refuge in because of the life she lives in the real world. Elsa's parents are divorced and she has trouble making friends at school. Her grandmother, a maverick who strives for unconformity, quickly became her role model growing up, and offers a chance for Elsa to ""nerd-out."" When Elsa's grandmother passes away, the heartbroken Elsa is set on an adventure exploring the life her grandmother lived and the people she interacted with in their apartment building.Fredrik Backman's book has its charms but also its difficulties. When Elsa is explaining the dynamics of the kingdoms and people of ""The Land of Almost Awake,"" it can be a little confusing to follow, as most of it is arbitrary information her and her grandmother have prior knowledge about, leaving a distance between her journey and the audience reading about it. While it doesn't completely hinder the story, it takes away from the focus somewhat. Some of the side-characters, like Elsa's mother and fellow tenants like Alf and Britt-Marie are interesting, but most of the supporting cast felt uninteresting or fell flat. Another minor problem was Elsa's constant references to contemporary pop-culture phenomenons, i.e. Harry Potter and the X-Men. While a normal seven year old would be fascinated by these subjects, it takes away from the potential world building of ""The Land of Almost Awake"" and the possibilities hiding within it.Fans of Backman's other novels should be able to appreciate this book. It's flawed but believable characters hold their own and the story is one worth telling.Rating 3.5/5"

Acesta este al doilea roman al lui pe care l-am citit, dintre care primul a fost ""Un bărbat pe nume Ove"" pe care îl îndrăgesc foarte mult. ""Bunica mi-a zis să-ți spun că-i pare rău"" este o poveste sentimentală cu o protagonistă în vârsta de 7(aproape 8) ani a cărui voce mi-a luat ceva timp să mă obișnuiesc, dar în același timp diferită și utilizarea ei constantă a Wikipediei a fost amuzantă și de o plăcere să o citesc. Este un copil extrem de deștept, dar și foarte naiv.Aceasta carte este despre a fi diferit, despre pierdere și acceptare, despre încercarea de a cunoaște și a înțelege oamenii. Este, de asemenea despre faptul că oamenii care nu îl cunosc pe Harry Potter au chiar nevoie de o intervenție a capului 😂Am râs mult la această carte, căci Backman se pricepe cel mai bine la asta 🧡Aceasta este una dintre acele cărți pe care le puteți citi atunci când aveți nevoie de ceva relaxant și distractiv. Deși pare ciudat și plin de umor la suprafață, are o oarecare profunzime ceea ce privește copilăria si cum trebuie să treci peste obstacole în viață. Recomand cu siguranță pe Backman 🥰"
232,no user info,Rating 2 out of 5,"This read like a very clever children’s book, the type that is supposed to be read by a parent to a child. The voice of the child narrator would not be believable to most adult readers, but would be aspirational for many children. The obvious imagery in the fairytales pointed to an audience less familiar with decoding layers of meaning. The life lessons, bullying, confronting loss for the first time, adjusting to a younger sibling, learning that the adults in your life are more flawed and more sympathetic than you realized are targeted for a young child. But, the vocabulary, designed to stretch the young reader, would be helped by an adult reading out loud. And the moments of adult humor felt like the author was winking at the parent he knew was holding the book. Evaluated as a child’s book, it was clever. But, I was not expecting a child’s book and generally do not enjoy them. So, my rating may not reflect what this book deserves."

Backman tem um modo único de contar as suas histórias, retratando tópicos sérios como o luto ou o bullying de um modo leve mas que não deixa de perder a sua importância. Sempre considerei que as histórias na perspetiva de uma criança são bastante especiais, e esta não é exceção. Elsa, apesar de por vezes poder parecer malcriada, é uma criança adorável com uma relação muito próxima da sua avó. Quando a avó fica muito doente, Elsa tem a missão de entregar cartas de desculpa a todas as pessoas que esta feriu de algum modo. Será nessa jornada que Elsa descobrirá que a sua avó cometeu alguns erros, e que os seus vizinhos podem não ser tão mesquinhos como ela julgava. Adorei o facto de o livro ser contado como um conto de fadas, das referências ao Harry Potter e fiquei curiosa para descobri mais sobre a Britt Marie (depois de Elsa, ela foi a personagem que mais gostei de conhecer).

Elsa and her grandmother have a very unique, loving relationship, with Elsa often the ""adult,"" who knows what is right from wrong. They have an imaginary world from Grandmother's fairy tales/life lessons, which is brought to life when the Grandmother dies, leaving young Else to deliver her farewell apology letters to her neighbors and with a special surprise.""There is nothing wrong with being different.

It was painful to get through. I didn't care about any of the characters - and I didn't like the main character - incredibly surprising since it is a 7 year old girl who was bullied, needed a friend, was living in a divorced home, and just lost her grandmother. It tried to be clever and wasn't. And it tried to be fantastical with the fairly tales, but it didn't work for me. It actually hated this fictional place he wrote about.

It was just absolutely beautiful. It was heartbreaking too though, and had me sobbing before I was even 50 pages in. I dripped tears all over the pages at the end. I can't even explain, I don't even have the words to describe how heartfelt Fredrik Backman's stories are. I can feel them deep inside, and they touch my heart in a way that you don't get very often. The stories come to life on the page, but it's almost as if they're more than that, like they're more than life. But at the exact same time they're so very real and down to earth.This book states facts about life left and right, and it does it through the eyes of a seven year old girl, which makes it that much more right, if that makes sense. This child, beautifully different Elsa, can see things so simply and clearly. She can see things how they truly are, as she lacks the muddying of truth and distortion of reality that comes with age and sorrow. Granny saw things straight too, and I loved her for that. I loved her metaphors too, and how she continued to outsmart them all.The human connections in this book are what really stood out to me the most though, as they do in all of Backman's books. Everyone is connected in a special way that, once realized, challenges your assumptions about people and makes you think about how things are never black or white, right or wrong, good or bad. There's so many shades of grey in between, and that's what makes us human. And that's ok. We just have to do the best we can.I just absolutely love this book, and I'm so glad I bought it, because I'll definitely be rereading it in the future."

А Ельза у книжці, навпаки, дуже багато читає, зокрема ""Гаррі Поттера"" (постійні згадки про цю книжку мене чомусь дратували, хоча я дуже люблю серію цих книжок). А ще у книжці цікаве переплетення казкового і реального - я була в захваті! Захотіла у Міамас😂 Якось цікаво ці шведи дивляться на світ і пишуть книжки. А які діалоги! А які в кожного героя нервові звички і особливості характеру! Точно байдужим не лишишся."

Se uită din nou în josul străzii.— Ce-nseamnă „Miploris”? întreabă Elsa.Cum Inimă-de-Lup nu-i răspunde, presupune că n-a înţeles întrebarea, aşa că-i explică:— Una dintre cele şase împărăţii din Tărâmul-Aproape-Treaz se numeşte Miploris.

Se gândeşte la ce-i povestea mereu bunica despre Inimă-de-Lup, că era de neînvins şi a înfrânt umbrele şi că doar el a putut face asta, pentru că avea inimă de războinic, dar suflet de povestitor.

Oké, nem tagadom, a gyerekek is élvezhetik bizonyos életkoron túl, de addig fenntartom: ez felnőtteknek szól.Ez a második ilyen katartikus élményem két hónap alatt, az első Atticus volt, a második az itt fő-, mellék- és mindenféle szereplői állást betöltő nagymama. Egy igazi, belevaló, vagány, okos és nagyon, nagyon emberi nagymama. Egy olyan ember, aki félelmeket életmesékkel gyógyít, aki mindent megtesz azért, hogy egyetlen unokája gyereknek és ne kiközösített furcsaságnak érezze magát, minden illegálisat elkövet, ami bizonyos kereteken belül megtehető (ezért szeretem talán a legjobban), aki verekedni tanít (szigorúan önvédelemből, persze) és aki megteszi a legfontosabbat: megfelelő terelgetés mellett ugyan, de hagyja az unokáját a maga útját járni, felfedezni, összefüggéseket keresni, fejlődni, válaszokat találni. Ez az a fajta nagymama, aki mindig veled van, még akkor is, amikor nincs. Aki barátok beszerzésének lehetőségét adja neked. Akivel lehet szekrényben aludni. Akivel lehet veszekedni, de nem túl sokáig. Aki vicces és nagyon jó a humorérzéke, noha egyesek kissé abszurdnak találnák. Aki worsokkal haverkodik és megtanít arra (is), hogy a worsoktól nem kell félni, mert azok a világ legjobb barátai (a fenébe, hogy hiányzik nekem az én worsom!), olyanok, akik fagyin és vaníliás csókon élnek és roppant türelmesek. És olyan nagymama, aki hibázik. Olyan, aki bocsánatot kér – ha nem előbb, hát utóbb. Olyan, akit receptre kellene felírni minden, de minden gyereknek, a felnőttekről nem is beszélve.Annak ellenére szerelmetesedtem bele a könyvbe, hogy az egyik szálat kissé tétovának, feleslegesnek, valamint nagyon kidolgozatlannak tartom. Ami miatt pedig még az is szeretni fogja, aki amúgy nem szereti a kislányokat, a nagymamákat és a worsokat, az a (bölcs) nyugalom és a szeretet. Giccs- és csöpögésmentes verzióban.

248,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13075496-raisa-beicu,Rating 5 out of 5,"After reading A Man Called Ove, I promised I will come back to this lovely Swedish author: Fredrik Backman because of his completely different style of writing. I chose to read next My Grandmother Sends Her Regards and Apologises, a book that turned out to be totally and utterly gorgeous in every way.There is a beautiful simplicity to the writing, yet this is not a simple book by any means, given the complexity to the emotions it evokes and explores. This is what always fascinated me about Fredrik Backman: while writing about fairy tales and seemingly simple stories, he is touching on the toughest and most intimate topics in a person’s life. I laughed, I cried, I enjoyed the silence and imagined all the moments when I could turn my life stories into fairy tales. Would it have been easier to get over some of the hardest moments?Elsa, who is almost eight, and her Granny are two of the most distinct characters you could ever discover in a book. I mean, they always go outside the law, they never respect rules and their imagination is endless. They never try to fit in, but they’re always defiant. They even have a secret language and at night, Elsa runs to her grandmother’s stories, to the Land of Almost-Awake and the Kingdom of Miamas because there, everybody is different and nobody needs to be normal. When her grandmother dies, she leaves a series of letters apologizing to people she has hurt from various reasons, in different situations. At this point, the real adventure begins for Elsa, because she finds out how real the fairy tales were, in fact. One by one, the letters lead her to an apartment building full of drunks, monsters, attack dogs and all the people gathered here help her to discover the truth about her grandmother.Grandmother Sends Her Regards and Apologises is a story about life and death and one of the most important human rights: the right to be different. I simply can’t express how heart touching the book was for me. After all the letters were delivered and the story came to an end, I could draw a conclusion: freedom is a state of mind for which we must fight a lifetime."
249,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53055819-abbie-ab-reads,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5 stars.My Grandmother Asked Me To Tell You She’s Sorry (I swear that’s the last time I’m typing out that title) is a funny and moving tale by Fredrik Backman in much the same line as A Man Called Ove! However, Ove was a lot simpler than Grandmother, and I think that simple storylines work better for Backman..There were a lot of converging storylines and hidden connections in this one, which were fun, but I think a lot of them weren’t expanded enough, and I still had questions. It’s also told from the POV of a 7 (going on 8) year old girl, and child narrations are not my thing. A lot of it relies on imagination, she talks about made up creatures and places all the time, and while they have relevance to the real world, I get tired of stuff like that quite quickly..BUT there were also lots of good points! As I said, it was very funny, very touching (I didn’t cry but I did tear up), and a very elegant depiction of how a child deals with grief. I also enjoyed the numerous Harry Potter references: Harry Potter is life. The characters were all up to Backman’s usual standard, and I really want to read Britt-Marie Was Here, as her character was so complex and tragic!.This book was translated from Swedish by Henning Koch and it is a BRILLIANT translation. Do you know how difficult it is to translate humour?! Things like funny misunderstandings and spelling mistakes? He does a commendable job!.As usual with Backman’s books, there is a lesson hidden among the fun: that usually monsters are things seemingly normal people carry inside them, and that ‘normal’ is totally overrated. Overall, not my favourite, but still enjoyable."

But it took me more than a month to finish this 350 and odd pages and I will tell you why.The precocious ‘almost eight’ years old Elsa has just lost her grandmother to cancer. Her grandmother was also her best and only friend, who kept her safe at night with the tales of the Land of Almost-Awake and the Kingdom of Miamas.  Now she is set with the task of handing over apology notes to the wacky characters in their apartment for her grandmother’s past and getting to know more about them and her family as well. I liked the concept of the book and how the little girl learnt to deal with all the changes and new people in her life. I loved many of these characters and their sub plots. But the book totally went over my head when it came to the imaginary land and its people. Maybe there is a reason to why I don’t read fantasy much. Blog | Facebook | Twitter |  Amazon |"

It gets four stars rather than five because it is a bit too touchy-feely for my taste. Most of the time I just thought it was heart-warming.Elsa, seven, almost eight has the world's craziest grandmother. They have a great relationship, but then cancer intervenes. At the end, her grandmother sends Elsa on a different kind of treasure hunt. She finds letters that she is to give to different people living in the same apartment building. All of the letters involve the grandmother apologizing for all sorts of insults and Elsa getting to know her neighbors - and her grandmother - better.It must be said that Elsa is not any ordinary 7-year old. She gets into fights at school and is far too mature for her age. She has a vivid imagniation, so much so that fantasy and reality sometimes mingle. The whole story is told from Elsa's perspective.So if you're into feel-good books, this could definitely be something for you too. I'll keep an eye on this author since this is the second moderately amusing, well-plotted, book he has written."

This is a grandchild’s ultimate privilege: knowing that someone is on your side, always, whatever the details.” This book is kind of a fairy tale for adults. I laughed aloud and I cried with it. It is written so beautifully that doesn’t let the grip go away for a while.“Every seven-year-old deserves a superhero. That's just how it is.” It shows what community means, what family means and how everybody can be a hero to the others. The main character of the book is 8 years old Elsa which her super hero is her weird Granny, and when after the death of the Granny she is sent to give her granny’s apologies to others she understands more and more how her favorite fairy tales told by her grandmother are from the real world and real people.Totally recommended."

266,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60921624,Rating 4 out of 5,"Before reading this Backman's book I wasn't sure if I wanted to spam all of his books right away, but now it is inevitable especially since I bought all of his books that are available here.Anyway, as I said in my previous reviews on Backman, the key word in describing his works is enjoyable. Backman writes about simple things, doesn't get all unnecessary dubious and even though all of his works are recognizable and similiar, every one that I read is unique on its own way.When it comes to this book, at the beggining I was afraid that it will turn into some strange female Ove book. But after just few pages it showed me how extraordinary it is. Backman used his superb capabilities in naration mixed with long lost good sense of humor to tell us a beautifull story about a almost 8 years old Elsa and her not so ordinary grandma.Elsa is a ""different"" kid and reading this book will tell you what Backman thinks being different means and will show you all the troubles about it. This is where we meet Elsa's grandma. At first, we will think she is crazy, and taking into account that she shots people with paintball rifles, breaks into zoo, drives without licence etc., we just may be right. But, the thing that is undeniable is how much she loves her granddaughter.Furthermore she undrestands Elsa more than anyone and she uses specific methods to help Elsa in ""resolving"" her problems. When I say specific methods I mean on creating a fictional world called the land of Almost-Awakes, place that is filled with fairytales and imaginary beings. Elsa's grandmother and Elsa ""go"" to this place and Elsa's grandmother narates her numerous fairytales and stories about it. Even so the fairytales and stories are not so special by themselves (for me anyway) the message behind them is the thing that is really important. Elsa's grandmother uses everyday happenings and characters in real life and transforms them in something else in those fairytales so that Elsa can find some way to comprehend, undrestand and find meaning in everything that happens to her.After Elsa's grandmother dies, she leaves her a bunch of letters and order to deliver it to people that live in her building. By doing this, Elsa is getting to know her neighbors and reveal some secrets she could never imagine, but also she is getting to know things about her grandmother and all the beautifull layers of her personality. Delivering those letters becomes biggest adventure of her life in which she will see all the conections between real world and fairytales her grandmother told her.In this book you will learn about many things. You will see a world from a not so ordinary kid's perspective struggles she has with being different, having divorced parents and simply not being understood. You will learn about love, humanity, family, strange neighbords and as Backman said that ""...not all monsters were monsters in the beginning. Some are monsters born of sorrow."" In the end, the best way to describe this book is to say that it is a beautifull fairytale on its own."

Ένα βιβλίο που όταν ξεκινάς να το διαβάζεις δεν έχεις ιδέα για το τι πρόκειται να συναντήσεις στις σελίδες του.Η Έλσα είναι ένα κοριτσάκι εφτά ετών που έχει να αντιμετωπίσει πολλές δυσκολίες στην μικρή και ήδη πολυτάραχη ζωή της. Οι γονείς της εχουν χωρίσει, η ίδια δεν έχει φίλους πέρα από τη γιαγιά της-τη σούπερ ηρωίδα της-, πρόκειται να αποκτήσει ενα νέο αδελφάκι-το Μισό όπως το αποκαλεί-και επιπλέον είναι ένα παιδί που περνάει δύσκολα στο σχολείο. Οι συμμαθητές του το κατατρέχουν, το απειλούν, το φοβίζουν και η ίδια προσπαθεί να περνάει απαρατήρητη, αόρατη.Η γιαγιά της εχει δημιουργήσει έναν φανταστικό κόσμο για τη μικρή της εγγονή εξιστορώντας της ιστορίες απο τα έξι μακρινά βασίλεια. Ιστορίες που βοηθούν τη μικρούλα να αντιμετωπίσει διάφορες καταστάσεις της καθημερινότητας της χωρίς όμως εκείνη να α��τιλαμβάνεται ακόμα τη σύνδεση τους. Όταν η γιαγιά της πεθαίνει της αφήνει κάποιες επιστολές που πρέπει να παραδώσει σε ανθρώπους όπου η γιαγιά έχει συγκρουστεί μαζί τους. Έτσι η μικρούλα Έλσα θα αρχίζει να ανακαλύπτει τι κρύβεται πίσω από τις ιστορίες της γιαγιάς και θα συνειδητοποιήσει πολλά για τη γυναίκα που αγαπούσε τόσο πολύ. Θα ανακαλύψει οτι το πνεύμα της γιαγιάς της την προσέχει μέσα από τους ανθρώπους που άφησε πίσω της, ανθρώπους που εκείνη στήριξε σε δύσκολες στιγμές τους. Η μικρούλα Έλσα είναι ένα παιδί διαφορετικό, πανέξυπνο και μέσα στην παιδικότητα του κρύβει ένα σοφό μυαλό. Όπως όλα τα παιδιά άλλωστε αν εμείς οι μεγάλοι αφουγκραστούμε όσα θέλουν να μας πουν. Ο Backman δημιούργησε ένα βιβλίο για την παιδικότητα που κρύβουμε μέσα μας και ο αναγνώστης έρχεται αντιμέτωπος με την φωνούλα της μικρής Έλσας η οποία εξιστορεί ίσως την πιο ευφάνταστη ιστορία που γράφτηκε ποτέ. Η εξιστόρηση των γεγονότων μέσα απο τα μάτια μιας επτάχρονης μας κάνει κι εμάς να σκεφτούμε όπως ακριβώς σκέφτεται ένα παιδί αυτής της ηλικίας. Και πως σιγά σιγά αρχίζει να αντιλαμβάνεται τι κρύβεται πίσω από τις λέξεις και φράσεις που ξεστομίζουν οι μεγάλοι στις συζητήσεις τους. Για ένα παιδί που δεν συμβαδίζει με τους συνομίληκους του, είναι διαφορετικός ο τρόπος σκέψης του, οι πράξεις του. Ένα παιδί που είναι συνεσταλμένο και κλεισμένο στον εαυτό του και η μόνη του διέξοδος είναι οι ιστορίες της γιαγιάς της. Οταν η γιαγιά δεν θα υπάρχει πια όλα αυτά θα χαθούν και η πραγματικότητα θα ορθωθεί μπροστά της σκοτεινή, τρομακτική και απειλητική. Μια φοβερή ιππότης της Μιάμας όμως δεν τα παρατάει ποτέ.Ένα βιβλίο που αποτελεί τονωτικό για την αυτοπεποίθηση μας. Ένα βιβλίο που θα μας συγκινήσει, θα μας κάνει να γελάσουμε, θα μας κάνει να δούμε αλλιώς την καθημερινότητα μας.""Το να έχεις μια γιαγιά είναι σαν να έχεις μια στρατιά.

''Svi sedmogodišnjaci zaslužuju superjunake. To je jednostavno tako. Svatko tko se s tim ne slaže, nije baš čist u glavi.''
Riječi koje je jednom Elsina Bakica izgovorila. I bila je u pravu. I tako se sa svojom unukom Elsom i ophodila. Jer, što jedno sedmogodišnje dijete treba u tim godinama, u kojem tek treba spoznati koliko svijet oko njega može biti okrutan? Superjunaka. Nekoga tko će na ožalošćeno lice izmamiti osmijeh, nekoga tko će pognutu glavu nagovoriti da se uzdigne, nekoga tko će ohrabrujuće potapšati po ramenu, čak i kad izgleda da je napravljeno krivo sve što se krivo dalo napraviti. Bakica je bila sve to, i puno više od tog. Ona je bila prava superjunakinja, i nije trebala sjajni plašt kako bi to i dokazala. Rekao bih da joj nisu potrebne ni supermoći, ali Bakica ih je imala. Ne, nisu to bile laserske zrake iz očiju, niti neizmjerna snaga, niti let, niti nevidljivost. Bakičina supermoć bila Zemlja Skoro Budnih u koju je, zajedno s Elsom, dosta često putovala. To je ono što je Elsa znala, a ni sama nije bila svjesna koliko je još supermoći Bakica skrivala u rukavu. A onda je, jednog dana, Bakica zauvijek ostala u Zemlji Skoro Budnih. Nešto na što Elsa nikako nije mogla biti spremna. Nešto što je Elsa doživjela kao svojevrsnu izdaju. Ali nije ni u najluđim snovima zamišljala da je Bakica za nju pripremila još jednu avanturu, usko povezanu s magičnom Zemljom koju je toliko puta s Bakicom posjetila.''Obećaj mi da me nećeš mrziti kad saznaš tko sam bila.'', neke su od posljednjih riječi koje joj je Bakica uputila, riječi koje isprve Elsi nisu bile nimalo jasne. Jer, kako bi ona mogla ikad mrziti svoju Bakicu? Ali, kako je Elsina avantura odmicala, polako je shvaćala kako je Bakica, kao i svaki drugi superjunak, ipak samo čovjek, čovjek s manama. Čovjek od krvi i mesa koji je za svog života počinio mnoge pogreške, a nije uspio svaku ispraviti. Svakom drugom čovjeku bilo bi tako lako osuditi postupke koje je Bakica počinila, ali ne i Elsi. Posljednja avantura koju je Bakica za nju pripremila samo je produbila ono što je Elsa prema njoj oduvijek gajila, a to je neizmjerna ljubav, toliko da joj je oprostila što je bez nje otišla u Zemlju Skoro Budnih. Malena Elsa na trenutke je toliko čangrizava, samovoljna, naizgled razmažena i, usudio bih se reći, izuzetno naporna kao dijete. Baš onaj tip djeteta koje zaslužuje dobru jezikovu juhu. Ali, tko od nas nije bio takav u Elsinim godinama? Kako joj zamjeriti? I to je magija i ljepota pisanja koju je Fredrik Backman uspio utkati u ovaj roman. Uspio je, unatoč svojim godinama (rođen je 1981. godine), u svom izričaju zadržati onu iskonsku dječju zaigranost, naivnost, znatiželju i maštovitost.Moja baka vas pozdravlja i kaže da joj je žao priča je o svemu onome što obitelj predstavlja u životu jednog pojedinca. Priča o tome kako je ljudski griješiti i, jednako tako, ljudski oprostiti, pregaziti preko onih manje lijepih stvari i ostaviti ih u prošlosti, nešto od njih naučiti i okrenuti se onom što nas čeka u budućnosti. Vjerojatno sam više desetaka puta rekao i sigurno ću još stotine puta to i ponoviti. Fredrik Backman je majstor. Majstor toplih ljudskih priča o malim, a tako velikim ljudima i njihovim naizgled malim djelima koja mogu mijenjati svijet. Majstor priča koje će vam povremeno zariti nož u srce, sve da bi potom nježno te zadane rane i vidale. Nešto što je Backmanu uspjelo s Oveom, a sada i sa superjunakinjom Bakicom."

This book caught my attention while on display at NBS SM Megamall. The title, though long, was intriguing. The cover, with the girl looking afar and the dog wearing a scarf, was just adorable. However, I hesitated because I still have tons of books at home. The following week, the book was gone. Then I tried looking for this in other bookstores. Until one day, I saw this at Fullybooked SM Megamall and afraid that I wouldn't see a copy again, I bought this right away. The story is about a 7-y/o precocious and smart girl Elsa who is living in an apartment full of different kinds of adults. She is closest to her 77-y/o maternal grandmother, Granny who used to be a surgeon and had to travel when Elsa's mother was about her age. Elsa's mum, Ulrika is now a surgeon too and she's pregnant to Elsa's half brother, Halfie. Ulrika divorced Elsa's father because ""they tried changing each other."" I think this divorce triggered the grandmother to take care of Elsa as children of divorced parents end up feeling like ""a visitor in both houses"" when the child alternately lives with his/her parents' families. Also, the grandmother had broken hearts to mend as she had to make difficult decisions in her career and family when she was still a practicing surgeon. Those decisions hurt the people (family and friends) who she ought to love but unintentionally neglected. Elsa is Granny's last card to make sense of her life and so she comes to a rescue by spending her last days being a hero (""Every 7 year old needs a hero"" repeated several times in the book) to her grandchild.A bittersweet charming story about life. Originally written in Swedish, this book is Fredrik Backman's follow up novel to A Man Called Ove (desperately looking for a copy!). They say that Backman is now becoming the master writer of curmudgeon novels. Since Honore de Balzac's Père Goriot (5 stars), I am beginning to enjoy books about old people. I think this is my of preparing myself to old age.This book reminded me of Muriel Barbery's The Elegance of the Hedgehog (4 stars) with a smart girl living in an apartment full of grownups. Then the human characters having animals as fairy-tale personas reminded me of Yann Martel's Life of Pi (4 stars). You combine both 4-star books and you now have an idea how likeable this book is.I ought to have than ""A Man Called Ove"" book. Christmas is nearing. I always appreciate receiving books for Christmas! *hint* *hint*"

И не заради рекламата. А защото ""Човек на име Уве"" ми хареса толкова много, че ме беше страх тази да не ме разочарова. И, за щастие, сбърках.Защото тази книга е дори по-нежна, по-топла, по-изпълнена с любов от ""Човек на име Уве"". В ""Уве"" имаше нещо... може би някак рязко, на първо четене, в характера на самия Уве. А тук... тук има усещане за прегръдка.""Баба праща поздрави и се извинява"" е една затрогваща книга. Затрогваща с огромната обич, която една ""смахната"" баба може да даде на внучката си. Обич, която залива като океан - но не дави, а обгръща, нежно и в същото време успокояващо и окуражително. Обич, без която няма как да оцелееш, ако си различен. И сила да повярваш, че ""различен"" не значи ""по-лош"". А тъкмо напротив...Особено въздействащо е това, че книгата започва и завършва с едно и също изречение. Толкова вярно, толкова просто и в същото време толкова трудно за проумяване... от онези - мъпетите. Мъгълите. Онези, които смятат фантазията за нещо лошо, и които със сериозни изражения разправят колко е важно да се живее в реалността. И как другото, видите ли, ""не е цивилизовано"".Много се говори за ""различните"". Най-често - с пре��рение или, в най-добрия случай, със снизхождение. А тази книга прави това, което всичкото това говорене не е успяло - казва, че без тях светът би бил невъзможен. И че на тях не им трябва много - само безусловна и безрезервна любов.Искрено се забавлявах с неочакваните обрати в книгата. Смях се и плаках с тази книга, а последните страници изчетох с буца на гърлото. Защото накрая всеки се оказва различен от това, за което се е представял - и което си е представял за себе си. И намира сили най-сетне да приеме тази различност. Защото онова дете в нас, което има нужда от вълшебни кралства, за да се справи с лошите неща, никога не умира истински. Ние само го изпращаме някъде надалече. И то е готово да се върне... в мига щом го повикаме.Защото знае, че имаме нужда от него, за да сме истински."

""Granny isn't in any of the photos from before I was born. When I was small I thought it was because she was a vampire, because they can't be seen in photos, and they can smoke like as much as they want without getting a sore throat. But she wasn't a vampire, was she? She was just never at home.""
This was a surprise in the end as I couldn't work out whether I was enjoying it or not. I abandoned it after a few chapters finding that I wasn't getting the humour, but then decided to give it another go. It reminds me of My Name is Leon that I read recently and My Girl that I also re-read recently. Both are told from the perspective of children.Elsa is a seven going on eight year old trapped in the mind of a much older child. The story is told from her perspective and concerns her grandmother who is either suffering the onset of dementia or just doesn't like to abide by the rules of society. Whichever it is, Elsa loves it as her granny says the things she is thinking, offends those that need offending and takes action whenever it is required. The rest of the family, and those living in the block of flats with granny, do their best with the resultant chaos and gradually the reason for their loyalty to this aging lady is revealed.A lot of the story is told in fairy tales from the Land of Almost Awake. Although the author brings this back to reality in the end, some of it is lost in translation and could do with being less complicated. I liked this idea though. This is an unusual novel with a lot of humour. It's a shame about the language especially as Elsa is the one using the bad language a lot of the time and no one really seems to bother about it. There were a couple of gross out moments, kind-of like Jim Carrey type of scenarios which tend to make me cringe. I'm amazed this hasn't fallen foul of the politically correct brigade as most of the characters have issues that are treated with a complete lack of sensitivity. However, that's a big part of what makes this novel special.I really enjoyed this and might well read it again at some point."
275,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4886774-katherine,Rating 5 out of 5,"Last week I was in a group where someone asked ""Has anyone read 'A Man Called Ove'?"" And my answer was ""God, I hated that book."" Interestingly, in that group it broke evenly between those who agreed with me and those who thought it was one of the best things they'd ever read. So it was with several giant grains of salt that I took a recommendation from someone in the group to read ""My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry"". Unquestionably, Backman likes his Quirky and Eccentric Yet Somehow Lovable Characters. In ""Ove"" I wasn't going for it because it was (in my view) such a poorly executed cliche. This book is filled with even more QEYSLC, led by their queen, who also happens to be the main character's grandmother. Maybe it's the framing that made the difference for me. Maybe it was seeing the story through the eyes of a bright, precocious child who is still, nonetheless...a child. I know some other reviewers here lost patience with the fairy tale story line (and I get it), but for me it drew together the threads of reality and fantasy, and what we all have to do sometimes to make it through another day. Backman has a way of putting together exquisite paragraphs that make you stop and sigh with recognition - and I wish I had had the foresight to read this with a stack of post-its at hand, because there are many, many places in this book with those lovely stop-and-breathe moments. As it turns out, there was no way I was going to stop reading long enough to go find post-its. Whatever the reason: I loved this book with all the hearts, and highly recommend it to anyone who loved (or still loves) fairy tales and fantasy."

At night Elsa takes refuge in her grandmother’s stories, in the Land-of-Almost-Awake and the Kingdom of Miamas where everybody is different and nobody needs to be normal.

My reactionsI was charmed by Elsa and her crazy grandmother, as well as by the cast of “not-quite-normal” characters who inhabit the apartment building Elsa calls home. As he did in A Man Called Ove, Backman gives the reader an eccentric central character, against whose craziness everyone else seems almost normal. There is plenty of action, some significant danger and distress, and enough humor to ease the tension. If the scenario is not believable, well who cares. I wanted a happily-ever-after ending, and for the most part that what’s I got. It’s a fairy tale, after all. Joan Walker does a fine job performing the audio book.

It's amazing how the author has intertwined all the threads by the end leaving your jaw dropped on the floor. The revelations by the end...oof wasn't expecting. There are a few words repeatedly used and I love how they signify an important part like the wurse, coffee, pink floral jacket and most importantly the eight-year-old hype.

I dalje stojim iza toga da može da bude starmala do sutra, ali da nije realistično prikazana sedmogodišnja devojčica. Na trenutke mi je bila pomalo nesnosna. Radnja mi je previše rascepkana i prekinuta spominjanjem bajkovitog sveta koji je njena baka izmislila.

Στην πολυκατοικία τους έχουν μαζευτεί οι πιο ετερόκλητοι χαρακτήρες, που δημιουργούν ένα μοναδικό σύμπαν μέσα στο οποίο μεγαλώνει το κοριτσάκι.Ο δεσμός της Έλσα με τη γιαγιά της είναι στενός: μαζί κάνουν πάρα πολλά πράγματα και ειδικά η γιαγιά κάνει ό,τι πιο τρελό μπορεί να φανταστεί κανείς, μόνο που κάποιες φορές οι πράξεις της είναι και… έκνομες, φέρνοντας την κόρη της στα όριά της. Όλοι θεωρούν τη γιαγιά παλαβή και ξαφνικά όλα σταματούν, όταν αυτό το χαρισματικό πλάσμα χάνει τη μάχη με τον καρκίνο. Αυτή είναι η αρχή μιας νέας σειράς περιπετειών για την Έλσα, μιας και μέσω ενός ιδιότυπου κυνηγιού θησαυρού, το παιδί ανακαλύπτει επιστολές που έχει αφήσει η γιαγιά της για όλους τους ενοίκους, ζητώντας τους συγνώμη για όσα λάθη της επηρέασαν τη ζωή τους.Το μυθιστόρημα διαδραματίζεται μέσα από τα μάτια του επτάχρονου κοριτσιού, που αφηγείται την ιστορία σε πρωτοπρόσωπη γραφή κι έτσι έχουμε τη δυνατότητα να παρακολουθήσουμε απερίσπαστοι τις αντιλήψεις της για τον κόσμο στον οποίο μεγαλώνει, να γελάσουμε σε κάποια σημεία για την αλληλουχία των γεγονότων όπως συνδέονται στο μυαλουδάκι της, να θαυμάσουμε τον ηρωισμό της, τη δοτικότητά της, την ειλικρίνειά της και τον τόσο μεγαλόκαρδο χαρακτήρα. Είναι ένα παιδί που αγαπάει να διαβάζει ξανά και ξανά τις ιστορίες του Χάρι Πότερ, μεγαλώνει με τα κόμικς και τις ταινίες των μεταλλαγμένων X-Men και φυσικά φοβάται κάποια πράγματα.Το εντελώς διαφορετικό σε αυτό το βιβλίο, είναι η υπέροχη δουλειά που έχει κάνει ο συγγραφέας πάνω στον παραλληλισμό του κόσμου μας και της καθημερινότητας της Έλσα με τους ανθρώπους, τις περιπέτειες και τα τοπία της Σχεδόν Ξυπνητής Χώρας, που αφηγούταν η γιαγιά στην εγγονή της με κάθε ευκαιρία σχεδόν. Σωστοί παραλληλισμοί, αχαλίνωτη φαντασία, ολοκληρωμένοι χαρακτήρες και σωστά δομημένη ιστορία σε ένα περιβάλλον με κακούς, μαχητές, τρόπαια, απαγορευμένες χώρες κ.λπ.. Με κλόνισε ο επιφανειακά απλοϊκός τρόπος με τον οποίο αντιλαμβανόταν το πανέξυπνο αυτό κορίτσι την πραγματικότητα, μιας και μες στην αθωότητά της έλεγε πράγματα που θέλουν επεξεργασία και δεύτερες σκέψεις:-Η γιαγιά σου ήταν ηλικιωμένη.-Για μένα δεν ήταν ηλικιωμένη. Την ήξερα μόνο εφτά χρόνια (σελ. 300).Κι όμως, η Σχεδόν Ξυπνητή Χώρα υπάρχει! Αυτό είναι κάτι που ανακαλύπτει η Έλσα σταδιακά, παραλληλίζοντας τους ανθρώπους που συναναστρέφεται και τις καταστάσεις που ζει με όσα της αφηγήθηκε η γιαγιά της!Δυστυχώς, όμως, οι υπερβολικά πολλές λεπτομέρειες αυτών των αφηγήσεων, η πληθώρα των χαρακτηριστικών γνωρισμάτων των ανθρώπων γύρω από το παιδί που δίνονται μέσα από τα δικά του μάτια -άρα έχουμε επαναλήψεις, μια λογική αλληλουχία που θέλει υπομονή ώσπου να την κατανοήσεις, μιας και αφηγείται ένα μικρό παιδί, απλές προτάσεις κ.λπ.- και ταυτόχρονα η μεγάλη έκταση του κειμένου, σύντομα με κούρασε και έψαχνα ανάμεσα στις σελίδες να βρω κάτι συναρπαστικό για να μου κρατήσει το ενδιαφέρον λίγο ακόμα. Ευτυχώς, βρήκα άφθονα περιστατικά, καθώς η πλοκή είναι γεμάτη εκπλήξεις. Πιστεύω παρ’ όλ’ αυτά, πως 500 σελίδες δίνουν άφθονο περιθώριο για μια σωστή σκιαγράφηση χαρακτήρων και ένα αριστοτεχνικό πλέξιμο των σχέσεων μεταξύ των κεντρικών χαρακτήρων, η παιδική αφέλεια όμως και ματιά από ένα σημείο και μετά, προσωπικά με κούρασε.Στο μυθιστόρημα υπάρχουν υπέροχοι χαρακτήρες που συναποτελούν μια… «συνηθισμένη πολυκατοικία. Σε γενικές γραμμές» (σελ. 38): α) η Μπριτ-Μαρί και ο Κεντ, όπου η σύζυγος φυλάει σαν μαντρόσκυλο την πολυκατοικία, ξέρει τα πάντα για τις αλλαγές έξω και μέσα από τα διαμερίσματα, κουνάει το δάχτυλο στους παραβάτες, τους οποίους και λατρεύει να επιπλήττει, παθαίνει αποπληξία όταν οι γείτονες παρατυπο��ν («μια στρίγγλα πλήρους απασχόλησης», όπως λέει και η γιαγιά) ενώ ο εργολάβος σύζυγος λείπει όλη μέρα, β) η αλκοολική «γυναίκα με τη μαύρη φούστα», που προτιμά να κλειστεί στον εαυτό της και να ουρλιάζει στους φόβους της τα βράδια παρά να αντιμετωπίσει σωστά το πρόβλημά της, γ) ο Λέναρτ και η Μοντ, όπου εκείνος φτιάχνει συνέχεια καφέ κι εκείνη ετοιμάζει όλη την ώρα κέικ, δ) ο οδηγός ταξί Αλφ που βρίζει σαν νταλικέρης, ε) «η μαμά με το αγόρι που έχει το σύνδρομο», στ) το άγνωστο και μυστηριώδες Τέρας που προκαλεί τον φόβο και τον τρόμο στην πολυκατοικία και ζ) ο Φίλος, ένας αρκουδό��κυλος που κερδίζει σταδιακά την αγάπη της Έλσα.Όλοι αυτοί οι άνθρωποι είναι κλασικοί τύποι ενοίκων πολυκατοικίας και ο συγγραφέας τούς χρησιμοποιεί όχι τόσο για να περιγράψει τα προβλήματα που παρουσιάζονται κάθε τόσο από τη γειτνίαση ή το πώς συμπεριφέρονται και αλληλεπιδρούν, αλλά για να φτιάξει ένα υπέροχο κοινωνικό ψυχογράφημα γεμάτο ανατροπές, μιας και οι επιστολές της γιαγιάς απευθύνονται κυρίως σε αυτούς κι έτσι σταδιακά, μέσα από μια συγκινητική σειρά γεγονότων, αρχίζουν ν’ αλλάζουν και να αποκαλύπτουν στον αναγνώστη ποιοι πραγματικά είναι. Οι άνθρωποι αυτοί έχουν ο καθένας τον δικό του Γολγοθά να ανέβουν κι ό,τι κάνουν ή λένε τη στιγμή που διαδραματίζεται το μυθιστόρημα, έχουν μια λογική βάση και μια σωστή εξήγηση.Έτσι άλλαξα πολλές φορές γνώμη για το αν κάποιος από αυτούς είναι ηλίθιος ή ιδιότροπος ή πολύ καλός, με αποτέλεσμα, χωρίς να το καταλάβω, να τους κάνω όλους μέρος της δικής μου ζωής ώσπου να τελειώσει το μυθιστόρημα. Ιδιαίτερη αγάπη έδωσα στην αλκοολική γυναίκα, γιατί η δική της ιστορία είναι η πιο ανατρεπτική και ταυτόχρονα η πιο συγκινητική. Από την άλλη, ο συγγραφέας δεν έριξε σχεδόν καθόλου βάρος στη μαμά με το παιδί που έχει το σύνδρομο.Και δεν είναι μόνο οι γείτονες που αλλάζουν μπροστά στα μάτια του αναγνώστη, αλλά και η ίδια η οικογένεια της Έλσα: Ποια ήταν στην πραγματικότητα η γιαγιά και τι συνέβη ανάμεσά τους που να προκάλεσε αυτήν την άτυπη αιώνια αντιπαλότητά τους; Τι ήταν η γιαγιά πριν γίνει γιαγιά και πόσο καλά ανέθρεψε την κόρη της; Πόσο υπεύθυνοι είμαστε για τα λάθη των παιδιών μας και ταυτόχρονα πόσο έτοιμοι να επωμιστούμε τα βάρη των δικών μας επιλογών, όσο λανθασμένα κι αν αποδειχθούν με το πέρασμα του χρόνου;Μέσα από αυτούς τους υπέροχους, ρεαλιστικούς πρωταγωνιστές ξεπηδούν διαχρονικές, καίριες και διεισδυτικές παρατηρήσεις πάνω σε θέματα που δεν είχα σκεφτεί ποτέ πριν. Για παράδειγμα: «Γιατί δεν είναι τέρατα όλα όσα μοιάζουν με τέρατα. Γιατί υπάρχουν πλάσματα που κουβαλούν ένα τέρας μέσα τους» (σελ. 183). Ή οι απόψεις του συγγραφέα για τον θάνατο: «Η ισχυρότερη δύναμη του θανάτου δεν είναι ότι κάνει τους ανθρώπους να πεθαίνουν, αλλά ότι μπορεί να κάνει τους ανθρώπους που μένουν πίσω να θέλουν να πάψουν να ζουν» (σελ. 307). Αυτά είναι ελάχιστα από τα παραδείγματα που μπορεί να συναντήσει ο αναγνώστης διαβάζοντας το βιβλίο, χωρίς να κουραστεί ή να δυσανασχετήσει για τη σοβαρότητά τους, αφού το μαγικό άγγιγμα της παιδικής αφέλειας τους δίνει μια άλλη διάσταση, ενώ το ταλέντο του συγγραφέα είναι αυτό ακριβώς: περιγράφει σχεδόν αμέσως κάτι κωμικό ή εντελώς διαφορετικό ώστε να αποσπαστεί η προσοχή!Κι ανάμεσα στα παραπάνω μηνύματα που περνάει το βιβλίο, υπάρχει και το θέμα του σχολικού εκφοβισμού ή bullying, μιας και η Έλσα θεωρείται περίεργο κορίτσι και η συμπεριφορά της αποτελεί βούτυρο στο ψωμί κάποιων παιδιών που θεωρούν τους εαυτούς τους σπουδαίους και σημαντικούς. Κάποιες φορές πάντως η Έλσα αντιδρά:«Η Έλσα εξακολουθεί να πιστεύει πως το αγόρι θα έπρεπε να την ευχαριστεί που τον χτύπησε με ένα βιβλίο, γιατί ήταν η πρώτη φορά που αυτό το αγόρι βρέθηκε τόσο κοντά σε ένα βιβλίο» (σελ. 92).Το μισό μυθιστόρημα διαδραματίζεται στο σχολείο, μιας και φτάνουν οι διακοπές των Χριστουγέννων, οπότε η Έλσα συγκεντρώνεται απερίσπαστη στην αναζήτηση των επιστολών της γιαγιάς, μετατοπίζοντας το κέντρο βάρους της αφήγησης στον κύριο θεματικό άξονα του βιβλίου.Το μυθιστόρημα «Η γιαγιά μου σας χαιρετά και ζητά συγνώμη» είναι ένα πολυποίκιλο συναισθηματικά κείμενο και αφορά τις ανθρώπινες σχέσεις, οι οποίες περιγράφονται και αναλύονται στις πραγματικές τους διαστάσεις, ελαφρύνοντας τη βαρύτητα με την αθώα και φιλοπερίεργη ματιά ενός οχτάχρονου κοριτσιού. Αν εξαιρέσει κανείς τον μεγάλο αριθμό σελίδων, οπότε ο τρόπος γραφής ίσως κάποια στιγμή κουράσει, το κείμενο ρέει αβίαστα και μου χάρισε γέλιο, συγκίνηση και περίσκεψη. Θέματα που μας απασχολούν όλους, χαρακτήρες που δεν είναι αυτό που δείχνουν, περιγραφές παράλληλες ενός αληθινού κι ενός μεταφορικού, φανταστικού σύμπαντος, ανατροπές και εκπλήξεις, ευρηματική λύση της πλοκής, είναι κάποια χαρακτηριστικά που με κέρδισαν από την αρχή σχεδόν της ανάγνωσης. Και πόσο όμορφα εικονογραφημένες είναι οι αρχές των κεφαλαίων με εικονίδια που αναπαριστούν αντικείμενα από την καθημερινότητα της Έλσα και από τη Σχεδόν Ξυπνητή Χώρα! Γιατί έτσι είναι και η ίδια η ζωή: ακροβατεί ανάμεσα στην πραγματικότητα και τη φαντασία."

So, too, must be fairy tales as it is demonstrated in this delightful and heartfelt novel by Backman.Elsa is seven-year-old girl; she is 'different' (as all superheroes must be), and she is loved unconditionally by her Granny. Granny is seventy-seven years old and crazy; she is Elsa's superhero, best-and only-friend, (and primary caregiver, in a sense), telling her fairy tales from the Land-of-Almost-Awake where Miamas and the other kingdoms from the dream clouds.When Granny dies of cancer and goes to Miamas, Elsa is devastated and angry. Her grandmother has left her a treasure hunt, though, and in so doing, Elsa will discover a fairy tale of a great adventure for real as she delivers letters of apology to the various occupants in the house she lives in with her mother, stepfather, and her unborn sibling she calls Halfie.All in all, a tenderhearted story with characters that the reader will grow to love for their quirkiness and vulnerabilities. Lots of humor as well as a few moments of tears throughout.Friends (Cindy, Elyse, Barbara, etc.) who have read Backman and recommended his novels were right: he is worth reading. This reader will be checking out his other stories in the near future.Quotes: ""Every seven-year-old deserves a superhero."" (page 1) ""'We want to be loved,'"" quotes Britt-Marie. ""'Failing that, admired; failing that, feared; failing that, hated and despised. At all costs we want to stir up some sort of feeling in others. The soul abhors a vacuum. At all costs it longs for contact.'"" (page 335) ""It's difficult ending a fairy tale."" (page 341)   ."

Her only friend is her grandmother, and a very unconventional one (she is that weird lady of the neighborhood). Her mother is not a bad mother, as many working mom in the world just is not there all the time. But that doesn't mather because Elsa has her grandmother.
“I didn’t want you to remember this day because of the scarf. So I thought instead you could remember it as the day your Granny broke into a zoo—”“And escaped from a hospital,” Elsa says with a grin.“And escaped from a hospital,” says Granny with a grin.“And threw turds at the police.”“Actually, it was soil! Or mainly soil, anyway.”“Changing memories is a good superpower, I suppose.”Granny shrugs.“If you can’t get rid of the bad, you have to top it up with more goody stuff.”
Alas, grandmothers don't last forever.This is discovery journey about family, relationships, mothers and daughter, grandmothers and granddaughters, friendship and ... regrets.*About Elsa, she is a 7 year-old going to 14. Precocious child, nerd, she escapes to an imaginary world with Granny. And then she keeps her mind in the quest, the clues, in a inner-building world that implies her building and her neighbours (think in a some kind of realist Coraline).Elsa doesn’t know if this means that Granny took all her stories from the real world and placed them in Miamas, or if the stories from Miamas became so real that the creatures came across to the real world. But the Land-of-Almost-Awake and her house are obviously merging.Elsa remembers how Granny said that “the best stories are never completely realistic and never entirely made-up.” That was what Granny meant when she called certain things “reality-challenged.” To Granny, there was nothing that was entirely one thing or another. Stories were completely for real and at the same time not.Hay muchos comentarios acerca de Harry Potter en este libro, ya que es el libro favorito de Elsa, y a veces parece que para ella fuera el único que existe en el mundo.  The Good Stuff: The secundary characters. You feel the drama. The threads between them. The no-so-good: Elsa's egotism. I'm sorry but I could never get to identify me with this girl, I accept that children could be like that, but she is not a likable character. So blunt and many times insensitive 7 y.o. girl? Hmm, sorry, no.I was bothered by the reference of the boy with Down Syndrome always as 'the Down boy' and 'the Down boy's mother'.(he didn't get a name in the story nor his mom)-Others books named here: -Harry Potter.-The Lionheart Brothers.(**ARC kindly provided by Atria Books, via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest review.**)"

I was reading this part after boarding a flight that had already been delayed by a couple of hours and was getting delayed further. Some of the other passengers got restless and were picking fights with the air hostesses. I, on the other hand, was thankful for the delay because it meant reading this for some more time because I knew that I wouldn’t be able to continue after landing. So, while others around me were agitated and anxious, I was literally in tears, because this book was really striking all the right notes. It was poignant and moving, so who cares about mundane things such as delayed flights, right?Wrong. Because what a disappointment the rest of the book turned out to be! After investing so much in Elsa’s loss I really felt let down trudging through the rest of the story. I felt like a child who has licked up all the cream and is left standing with the bland biscuit. Elsa came across as petulant and annoying. I wouldn’t say that about a child, but she was an 8 year old behaving as an 18 year old anyway. I didn’t get why she was being bullied at school. I didn’t get why the blurb promises this story to be about a little girl who delivers letters, when it is only a minor part of the plot.The only 'character' that I liked was the wurse, so that says a lot."

As for this one, I read to hear the snippets and quotes from Granny but the rest of the plot was subpar in comparison. There were so many wonderful quotes in this novel though, which is in part why I enjoy Fredrik Backman’s writing style.The main character got on my nerves at times and was utterly unbelievable as a 7 year old. If the MC needed to discuss lease holds, marital affairs, and rescue others, then an older age should have been written into the story. Also, I never want to read about animal abuse, for any reason. It always comes across as a cheap trick to manipulate the reader’s emotions. Kill off the other characters if you must, but always leave the dogs alone please.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: Not all monsters look like monsters.

The protagonist, Elsa, is a precocious 7-year old girl tasked with delivering the apology letters left behind by her grandmother, who passes away at the very start of the story. Elsa is smart, imaginative and brave, her voice sounding far more grown-up than her actual age would indicate. Her grandmother is a larger-than-life character, with cute little idiosyncrasies and a fascinating backstory. In the wake of her loss, Elsa goes on a journey that reveals her family and neighbors' interwoven histories and secrets. While it can get a little sad, I think My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorryis ultimately a feel-good book, one that highlights the importance of family, friendship, imagination, and second chances."

This second novel is such a contrast and completely different. I am sure this will be a successful novel and many will love it for all the same reasons I didn't. The silly characters and the fantasy world they make up and live in!

318,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2370866-eva,Rating 5 out of 5,"ENGLISH BELOWHet is al weer een tijdje geleden dat ik een boek heb gelezen waar ik echt van heb genoten. Dus ik ben heel blij dat ik dit boek toevallig zag in de bibliotheek. Het stond niet eens op mijn lijstje, maar het was een heerlijke leeservaring. Het is vrolijk, grappig, verdrietig, diepzinnig en knettergek tegelijk. Het verhaal gaat over de 7-jarige Elsa. Elsa heeft maar één vriend, en dat is haar 77-jarige oma die met vlagen knettergek is. Ze vertelt Elsa de prachtigste verhalen en schept voor haar een hele eigen sprookjeswereld om in weg te vluchten. De verhalen die ze vertelt gaan erover dat het prima is om anders te zijn. Elsa is anders, ze is slim, en heeft het daardoor moeilijk op school. Haar oma is haar rots in de branding. Totdat ze doodgaat en Elsa alleen achterlaat. Ze laat een brief achter en een speurtocht en zo gaat Elsa op zoek naar het verleden van haar oma, en naar wie ze nou eigenlijk echt was. Het verhaal begint als een sprookje, vol monsters, ridders en draken. Maar langzamerhand verandert dat. Het monster uit de sprookjes van oma, blijkt ook in het echt te bestaan. Elsa ontdekt dat achter elk sprookje, en elk sprookjesfiguur een verhaal of persoon in de echte wereld schuilt. Het is een coming-of-age vertelling waarbij Elsa langzaam maar zeker uit haar sprookjeswereld stapt. Ze ziet dat mensen niet altijd zijn wie ze lijken te zijn. Dat geldt voor haar oma, maar ook voor de mensen om haar heen. Backman weet dat op een bijzonder grappige manier te vertellen en leeft zich goed in in de wereld van een kind. Alles wat je leest is uit het perspectief van Elsa. Sterk verteld, ik kon het boek nauwelijks wegleggen. Backman heeft op een knappe manier alle karakters in het boek en alle verhaallijnen laten samenkomen zoals in een ontknoping in een boek van Agatha Christie: alles heeft met alles te maken. Dat is ook een van de zwakke punten: het verhaal is zelf ook een beetje een sprookje, met vrolijke en trieste momenten, maar net iets teveel toevalligheden. Bovendien vind ik Elsa wel erg volwassen voor een 7-jarige. En kan ik me nauwelijks voorstellen dat haar moeder, die naar voren komt als een zeer ordelijke control-freak, Elsa werkelijk steeds tot midden in de nacht zou laten rondzwerven. En er zijn een aantal meer ontwaarschijnlijkheden. Maar al met al vond ik het een heerlijk boek, met hier en daar rake opmerkingen over leven en dood. Zoals deze: 'De grootste macht van de dood is niet dat hij mensen kan laten doodgaan, maar dat hij ervoor kan zorgen dat de achterblijvers willen stoppen met leven'. En ondanks dat er veel over de dood wordt gesproken, is het een hoopvol boek. Dat is ook wel eens fijn.4,5 ster. Naar boven afgerond 5 (misschien worden dat er nog vier, dat moet nog blijken.----------ENGLISHIt has been a while since I read a book that I really enjoyed. So I am very happy that I saw this book by chance in the library. It was not even on my list, but it was a wonderful reading experience. It is cheerful, funny, sad, profound and crazy at the same time. It made me cry two times.The story is about 7-year-old Elsa. Elsa only has one friend, and that''s her 77-year-old grandmother who is absolutely crazy at times. She tells Elsa the most beautiful stories and creates an entire world of fairy tales for her, in order to escape reality. The stories she tells are about being different, and about that being fine. Elsa is different, she is too smart for her own good, which brings her enormous heaps of trouble at school. Her grandmother means everything to her.Until she dies and leaves Elsa all alone. She leaves her a letter and sends her on a quest. Along the way Elsa finds out about her grandmothers past, and who she really was. The story begins as a fairy tale, full of monsters, knights and dragons. But gradually that changes. The monsters from the fairy tales also appear to exist in real life. Elsa discovers that behind every fairy tale, and every fairy-tale figure, is a story or person in the real world.It is a coming-of-age narrative in which Elsa slowly but surely steps out of her fairytale world. She sees that people are not always who they seem to be. This applies to her grandmother, but also to the people around her. Backman tells his story in a very funny way and has a knack of seeing the world through the eyes of a child. Everything you read is from Elsa's perspective. Well written, I could hardly put the book away. Backman has cleverly brought together all the characters in the book and all the story lines as in a denouement in a book by Agatha Christie: everything has to do with everything.That's also one of the weak points: the story itself is also a bit of a fairy tale, with happy and sad moments, but just too many coincidences. Moreover, I think Elsa is very mature for a 7-year-old. And I can hardly imagine that her mother, who emerges as a very orderly control freak, would always let Elsa roam around in the middle of the night. And there are a number of other improbabilities.But all in all, I thought it was a wonderful book, with some remarks about life and death here and there. Like this one: “Death’s greatest power is not that it can make people die, but that it can make people want to stop living.” And despite the fact that there is much talk about death, it is a hopeful book. That is also nice, for a change4.5 star. Rounded up to 5 stars, but time will tell if it remains 5 stars or will become for. I'm a little bit in between..."

Sākums bija labs, vidus gāja pasmagi, Bet beigas vairāk vai mazāk salika visu pa vietām. Laikam jau grāmata, kuru var lasīt vēlreiz tūlīt pēc izlasīšanas. Dzīves gudrībām pārbāzta grāmata, visdrīzāk katrs lasītājs atradīs savas gudrības, savu interpretāciju utt. Astoņgadīgās Elzas ikdiena pamatā paiet kopā ar savu vecmāmiņu. Jāpiebilst, ka skolā Elza ir atšķirīgā meitene, kurai nav draugu un ikdiena paiet pazemojumos no klasesbiedriem. Toties viņas vecmāmiņa ir pilnīgi traka. Ikdiena kopā ar Omci paiet kā pasaku valstībā. Tur ir prinči, princeses, karaļvalstis, pūķi briesmoņi un vurses. Pēc Omces nāves liekas, ka visa šī pasaku valstība būs pazaudēta. Bet izrādās, ka tā turpinās. Izrādās, ka tā ir kā covers ikdienas notikumiem. Un pat pēc nāves Omce sūta sveicienus, atvainojas un izdara lielas lietas. Par spēju atrast dimantus ikdienas pelēcībā. Iespējams, ka līdz 5 zvaigznēm neaizvilka personīgo īpatnību dēļ. Man patīk grāmatas ar spraigu sižetu un ātri lasāmas.

Un būt sevišķai ir labākais veids, kā būt citādai. Ja no sliktā nevar izvairīties, tam klāt jāliek daudz vairāk labu lietu. Jo ne visi briesmoņi jau no sākuma ir briesmīgi. Daži briesmoņi dzimst no skumjām. Elza dzird, kā žūpa sāk dziedāt savu dziesmu. Jo ne visi briesmoņi izskatās pēc briesmoņiem. Daži savu briesmonību nes dvēselē. Uz vējstikla krīt sniegpārslas, tik milzīgas kā spilvendrānas. Mamma uzliek roku uz Elzas rokas, pieliecas, piespiež lūpas vietā, kur abu plaukstas saskaras, un dziļi ievelk gaisu, it kā censtos dabūt pilnas plaušas ar Elzu. Tā mammas dara ar meitām, kuras pārāk ātri pieaug. Elza saprot, ka viņš stāsta par vēstules saturu tāpēc, ka saprot, kā tas ir, kad cilvēkam ir noslēpumi no tevis tikai tāpēc, ka tu esi bērns. Ir grūti palīdzēt tiem, kuri negrib paši sev palīdzēt. Un miamasieši smejas tik skaļi, ka stāsti ap kapu ceļas gaisā kā laternas. Līdz visi stāsti un gramatiskās izteiksmes saplūst vienā. Viņi smejas, kamēr neviens nespēj aizmirst to, ka aizejot mēs aiz sevis atstājam tieši smieklus. Taču Miamasā jaundzimušais nedabū krustvecākus, viņš dabū Smējēju. Pēc bērna vecākiem un vecvecākiem, un vēl dažiem cilvēkiem, kuri Omcei, kad viņa stāstīja pasaku, nešķita tik briesmīgi svarīgi, Smējējs ir nākāmā svarīgākā persona Miamasas bērnu dzīvē. Un Smējēju neizraugās vecāki, jo viņš ir parāk svarīgs, lai to uzticētu viņiem. Izvēli izdara pats bērns. Tāpēc, kad Miamasā piedzimst zīdainītis, visi ģimenes draugi sanāk pie šūpuļa, stāsta pasakas, taisa ģīmīšus, dejo, dzied un joko, un pirmais, kurš bērnu sasmīdina, kļūst par Smējēju. Viņi ir personīgi atbildīgi par to, lai bērns smietos, lai bērns smietos cik vien iespējams bieži, skaļi un dažādās situācijās, sevišķi tad, kad vecāki jūtas neērti. "

Про те, як безглузді і необдумані рішення можуть зруйнувати декілька життів, про те, що ніколи не знаєш, що твориться в душі людини, яка опустилася на саме ""дно"" або здається страхітливою.

322,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7125124-jess-harbinger-of-blood-soaked-rainbows,Rating 5 out of 5,"Fulfilling my 2021 challenge to reread one book a month that I either read and never reviewed or read so long ago that a reread is in order.So I read this for my challenge back in April, and here we find ourselves in June.I actually decided to reread this because I just wrote a lazy ass non review the first time I read it and I really really wanted to write a proper one. And here I am two months later and still haven't written a proper review of this book that I gave 5 stars to twice.Maybe I've put off writing it because I am not sure I can adequately describe my feelings for it. I've always said that my five star reviews are typically split second gut decisions. If my first instinct after finishing is a 5 stars than that's what it is. If I have to question whether it is or it is not, than it's not.I've definitely read better books than this one that didn't get five stars. I've read books that have far less flaws that didn't get five stars. But this book has some of the biggest heart and some of the most unforgettable characters I've read about. Any book that gives me very precise preconceived notions about characters in the beginning and then flips those notions on their faces not once, not twice, but half a dozen times, is going to be a book I will remember. And I will remember this book. Elsa is a very precocious seven year old who has a pretty wacky and interesting grandma. And her grandma is Elsa's best and only friend. Elsa endures constant bullying at school, her pregnant mom unintentionally ignores her, her mom's boyfriend can't relate to her, her father has a seemingly perfect second family, and Elsa doesn't know where she fits. Except with Granny. Granny makes it her life's mission to be a superhero to Elsa. She even teaches Elsa a secret language that only they know. They also create a brand new world together called Miamas. And together they go there when things get too rough. And Granny spends every night telling Elsa stories of Miamas and its past. When Elsa finds that Granny has been keeping secrets from her, namely that she is dying of cancer, Elsa is crushed. So crushed in fact, that after her superhero takes her final breath, Elsa can no longer find her way into Miamas.Before dying, Granny entrusts Elsa with a secret mission. To find people that Granny has wronged in her past and deliver letters of apology to them. In doing so, Elsa learns about her Granny, about who she was before she became a grandmother, and not all of it is pretty. By apologizing through Elsa, secrets come out, truths are revealed, and the people that Elsa has been around her whole life begin to change as does Elsa's perceptions of them. She begins to find the unlikeliest of friends in the unlikeliest of places and it was just beautiful to experience. I cannot express how this book came together in the most magical way for me. These characters felt so real, so human. This story, though flawed, was gorgeously stitched together. Characters I felt could find no redemption in my mind in the beginning began not only to grow on me but to win me over completely. And that in and of itself is a talent that not many authors have.This book just worked in every possible way for me. And so I feel a bit of a loss for words when it comes to exactly why this was so special. And so I have to go back to that gut feeling that I felt as soon as I was finished. I knew it was going to be a 5 star read immediately, and I also knew that I wanted to read it again.I cannot wait to read this author's other books, but still a little timid to do so as I just found this one so perfect. Elsa at times broke my heart to pieces, and Granny stole the show, even though her storyline technically ended too soon. This story is a lot of things, but above all it really reveals how much memories and stories can preserve those that we have lost. And sometimes the hardest thing is to find out truths about those we have raised high and reconciling that disappointment with the person we remember. Everyone has secrets and a past we know nothing about. Everyone has little pieces of themselves that are hidden from even those who know them best. And this book explores all those relationships and truths and nooks and crannies of the soul and it was glorious.All the stars I have to give.ORIGINAL REVIEWFirst read book of 2019 and it is a coveted 5 star read. This bodes well for the rest of the year.I absolutely loved this book. Even if there were flaws, I ignored them. Even if it could have been unrealistic, I balk and say it is imaginative. Even if it could be considered a bit cozy, I shake my head and say it is rich and character driven and makes you just feel good.And sometimes feeling good is what you need."
323,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62899610-lana,Rating 3 out of 5," Having a grandmother is like having an army. This is a grandchild's ultimate privilege: knowing that someone is on your side, always, whatever the details. Even when you are wrong. Especially then, in fact. A grandmother is both a sword and a shield.My Grandma Asked Me to Tell You She’s Sorry is the story of a little girl named Elsa who loses her grandmother. They were both “different” from everyone else, and that’s what made them special.This book made me reflect on how grateful I am for having two loving grandmothers. My grandmother on my father’s side and I have one of the best dynamics to this day. She was the one who introduced me to cereal (much to my dad’s disliking, since he insists it’s unhealthy). She was the one who taught me cooking tricks, even though I suck at cooking. She was the one who watched soap operas with me after I arrived at her house after school and waited for my parents to come home after a long day at work. I saw a lot of my dynamic with my grandmother in this book and it made me tear up, to be honest. Hell, even their conversations had a lot to do with ours! I once told my grandmother as a joke that I believed in vampires more than I believed in God and we both laughed so hard. My main problem with this book was that the magic aspect was hard to follow at times. I felt really lost sometimes, despite how much I absolutely loved Elsa’s character.Regardless, I did enjoy this more than A Man Called Ove. It made me feel so many more things! 3.5 stars!"

It’s funny how a person might not be a great mother or father but can be a fantastic grandparent. I experienced that with my grandfather. I loved how fantasy and reality were woven together in this sweet and somewhat sad story. What a precocious child Elsa is and so lucky to have so many people in her corner. I just loved this story. It comes across like spun sugar but there is some real grit hidden underneath. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up.

This happens to be my first Fredrick Backman book - yes, I get the buzz now and feel sorry for not picking his books earlier. 🥺This book really grew on me. From not liking the first few chapters to crying by the end of it, it was like riding a wave of emotions.Our protagonist, Elsa, is an extraordinary smart kid but thanks to her Granny's pampering, she is a brat. She thinks she is better than everyone because she has read all the Harry Potter books, knows the difference between a superhero and a mutant (well, that sort of counts, I agree) and can look up on Wikipedia at just eight years of age. Pretty smart? Not to give away the plot, Elsa is put into action after her granny assigns her a crucial task to deliver a letter and apologize on Granny's behalf right before her grandmother dies of cancer.As Elsa sets on this journey, she comes to know who her Granny really was before she became her grandmother. It's a subtle reminder to us that human beings can't be categorised as good or bad and are a package of contrasting traits; we think we know our parents, our friends, but we don't! Someone can be a complete jerk to you but an absolute sweetheart to others.I was in love with Elsa's Granny, although she was the reason why Elsa wasn't likeable in the beginning, but ignoring her excessive pampering, she was a superhero! The web of fairy tales she wove using tales from her actual life was brilliant! Once that web is detangled, she only comes out as a kinder human being!The beauty of this book is its well-developed side characters. Each of them has a part to play, a story to tell that only makes them more human and lovable to my eyes. Backman does a great job of connecting such diverse characters and their back-stories to build a cohesive plot. Incredible!I didn't enjoy the fairy tales which were too complex and frustrating, though it got bearable once I started seeing their relevance. Some sections were overly dramatic with all that wardrobe-sleeping and Wikipedia-quoting. Since the plot is primarily about Elsa's growth as a person while unfolding the pages of her Granny's life-story, it is imperative to ignore the annoying sections and enjoy the good parts with tenderness.To write such an emotional story with such subtlety is definitely a superpower. I can't wait to pick my next Backman book. In awe!4.25/5🌟 (rounding down).𝐓𝐖: Death, Divorce, War, Grief, Alcoholism, Infidelity and Bullying."

328,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4288961-katie,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5/5I loved A Man Called Ove last year, and I had this on my shelves as well, so I was looking forward to getting to it. I didn't love it quite as much as Ove, but it was a lovely story about friendship and community, and stories and bravery.It's similar to Ove in that it brings together a group of people that don't seem to go together. Elsa's grandmother leaves her a task to deliver a number of letters to people who live in their apartment building. Throughout the story, we find out how they are all connected, both to each other and to the stories Elsa's grandmother has been telling her all her life.The stories act as allegories, and it's up to Elsa to figure everything out. Luckily, Elsa is a very clever girl, though I'm not sure her voice wasn't too mature for a seven-year-old. That was the one thing that sort of took me out of the story.It is a charming novel, though. I very much enjoyed the fairy tales, particularly when they began to connect to the real world. I also liked seeing other sides to the characters in the apartment building. There were stories of tragedy and regret as well. Elsa's grandmother's letters were apologies for various different things, and it's really regret that drives a lot of this story. I think that's what forms the serious centre of this novel, the regrets we carry, and the ways we try to atone, and how our actions impact on other lives.Ove was both serious and funny. I think this book is more serious, but it contains seeds of possibility and hope too. It's about letting go of the past and moving on. And it's about living with as few regrets as possible. It's also about the power of stories to bring comfort and to teach us how to live well."
329,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/946086-sterlingcindysu,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is my first read from this author. He does a very good job of tight-rope walking between a fairy tale story and real life.Many people commented that The Snow Child was an adult fairy tale, or maybe more accurately a modern fairy tale. I didn't get that story at all--was it real or not? Too real to be a story and too storyish to be real. But in this story characters travel parallel lines in the same way the Wizard, Scarecrow, Lion, Witch and Tin Man were all characters in the ""real"" story as well as the fantasy of The Wizard of Oz. There's a lot of characters to keep track of and I would recommend reading this in as few sittings as possible to keep things straight between the parallel story lines, and the relationships to each other. As usual I had a very hard time believing Elsa, the main character who's ""7 going on 8"" could be that clever. I had the same complaint in The Elegance of the Hedgehog and Flavia Luce in her series. Maybe if Elsa was 13 or 15 that part would be more believable. I tried googling different words of the kingdom to see if they were words of another language, but didn't find anything. I wonder if Backman's other book about Britt-Marie is about the Britt-marie in this book. "
