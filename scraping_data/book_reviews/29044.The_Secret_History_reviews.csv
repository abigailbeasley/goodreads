I said I ""loved"" its characters, though of course I meant more that I loved them as figures, considering they are unlikable murderers. I wrote about it vaguely and glowingly, thinking everyone had sort of...gotten the point of the book, already.But then I read this review in Gawker, so I'm coming back.The Secret History follows mainly our narrator, Richard, as he looks back on his time in the classics program of a liberal arts college. Richard is unhappy, impressionable, desperate. His values are more ideas than ideals - vague and dim reflections of what love, and beauty, and wisdom, concepts he's never known, might feel or look like, rather than what they are.He arrives at his preppy and prestigious(ish) New England college to slowly become obsessed and then part of the mysterious and selective classics program, a cultlike group of trust fund babies led by an often-overstepping and charismatic professor. Coming from a poor and abusive background, where beauty is nowhere to be found, Richard wants nothing more than to immerse and lose himself in this group of wealthy and charming students. He wants to befriend them, to sleep with them, to live with them, to do everything he can to become them. Including, as they indulge in ever-spiraling hedonism, murder.And it never works.When our story ends, our group is decimated, some members dead, some irrevocably changed, all unwilling to return to the story of that fateful year - all except Richard, who is unable to leave it behind.When I hear this, I don't believe that the point of the story, or what Tartt is trying to tell us, is that a love of beauty is equivalent to an amoral life. I don't think she condemns an appreciation for the aesthetic, or even a classical scholarship. I don't think you're supposed to like these characters, or even think they're very realistic - they are, after all, portraits in hindsight written by someone in the throes of unrequited obsession.I don't think you're supposed to relate to them, or to see their story as something that might happen to you if you read too much Greek myth or like pretty things too much.To quote the article that inspired the fit of rage that has me typing away, I don't think this is ""about all the things [its writer] loved,"" while ""miss[ing] the point of them entirely."" At the age of seventeen, they continue, they ""wanted (I thought) exactly what its youthful characters wanted: a poetic life, a mythic life, a life shot through with meaning. I loved (I thought) exactly what its characters loved: nostalgic emblems of an era imagined as significant.""To that I say: huh?As I grow older, I care less for lovely or perfect or nice or even good (in the moral definition of the word) characters, and find myself only wanting to read about the unlikable, the complex, the ones who have something to say on what I shouldn't do, rather than teach me about what I should.It was clear to me that The Secret History is not the latter example, but the former.Our merry band of classics fetishists may think they are living a life of poetry and meaning, but we, the readers, know they aren't. We know that life's beauty lies not in pleasure without regard for others, in the fulfillment of selfish desires, but in case we get confused, Donna Tartt shows us that a life lived by those guidelines leads to irrevocably damaged relationships, unfading pain, and death.The Secret History is not a nihilistic book because its characters' behaviors result in no meaning. Quite the opposite - it is a book about what makes life meaningful by showing us what meaning is not.The Gawker piece quotes a Tartt essay in which she writes, “'Something in the spirit longs for meaning — longs to believe in a world order where nothing is purposeless, where character is more than chemistry, and people are something more than a random chaos of molecules,'” and in this vein concludes, ""To take Tartt the essayist seriously is to wager on that meaning. Even if that means leaving Hampden behind.""And I would agree. To find meaning, one must leave Hampden behind - for it was never intended that what happened there should be lived by as example. (I also think there's something very interesting in the class dynamics here. But I'll save that for the next time I get mad enough to write almost 1,000 words.)Bottom line: Book so nice I reviewed it twice.------------book club updatethis is the july pick for the beautiful world book club!! elle and i will be vibing amidst the dark academia and the gluttony and the classics. please join us!!------------original reviewI think this is a story about the destructive power of guilt. I think this is about Here is the problem with reviewing every book I read: Sometimes I throw around terms before I really need them, and then once I read THE book, The Story that requires and deserves that descriptor, I have nothing to give it.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...Right now I have this problem. Because I have used the word “immersive” before, and immediately upon my completion of this book it became clear that I should have saved it for right now.I felt like I lived inside these pages. I felt like I began to think in the beautiful and sharp prose that fills them. I felt like I knew the characters, ate decadent lunches and walked the snowy campus and whispered with them. I felt an aching emptiness, a genuine longing, when I read the final words.I miss living here.This was very, very slow - to the point that about halfway through I said (inexplicably, aloud), “I don’t know what they’ll even do for the rest of the book” - and yet I was gripped by it.It’s genuinely masterful.I love Richard and I LOVE Camilla and I love Francis and I, fine, okay, at least like Charles and Henry and even Bunny and Julian.And I miss them all.This is an incredible work, but maybe the most incredible thing is how the reader is Richard. I, too, miss my bygone days at my prestigious New England college with my whip-smart group of eccentric friends, and, like him, I am too quickly forced to realize the fallacy of such a feeling.After all, it was all a fiction.Bottom line: I’m raising this to a five star rating.------------pre-reviewyou'll have to excuse me, i'd love to actually write something here but my brain is broken and i am incapable of thought.also seems absurd to try to use words when donna tartt took all the good ones.review to come / 4.5 stars------------currently-reading updatesme: *is slightly behind on my reading challenge*also me: *starts a 600-page book*"

“Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it.”

I have never read anything like this book in my entire life. I laid in bed for over an hour last night upon finishing this book, just tossing and turning and thinking about everything I just consumed. I still don’t think I can put my feelings into words, but I can honestly say this book was a cathartic experience for me, and the irony of the word “catharsis” being a Greek rooted word is not lost on me, because if this book is anything it’s a modern day Greek tragedy. The Secret History is told in a unique style, which is a man reminiscing on some significant events that took place in his college life a bit over a year ago. So, we follow a younger version of Richard, who is finally starting his life away from his abusive and poor family in California. He gets accepted into an elite college in Vermont, and moves across the county in hopes of a fresh start. Upon arriving to the college, Richard is denied entry into an Ancient Greek course, because the professor that teaches it only allows enrollment to his small, handpicked, group of students that seem almost cult-like. Needless to say, Richard becomes utterly obsessed with the five students in this group and the professor, Julian Morrow, himself. And with a turn of good luck, and by solving a Greek problem, Richard is accepted into this exclusive group.Yet, in the prologue we find out that Richard, and four others from the group, murdered one of the other students who they are supposed to have a very close friendship with. The Secret History is then told in two parts, one being the events that took place leading up to the death of their fellow classmate, and then one part being all the events that take place after he is murdered. Bunny is the poor soul that is unfortunately murdered by his peers, yet he’s a racist bigot and you’ll be kind of happy he’s dead, for the most part. Richard, as stated in all the paragraphs above, is the narrator looking back on the events that took place. Henry is my personal favorite, but perhaps the worst of the bunch. Or maybe the best, I’m not really sure, but that’s truly the beauty of this story. Twins, Charles and Camilla. Charles is a bad alcoholic and drug user, and Camilla steals most people’s heart and/or affection. And lastly, we have Francis, who owns a country home that is the stage for many events that take place in this book. Oh, and everyone but Richard has money, even though Richard tries his damnedest to keep that a secret. 

“What we did was terrible, but still I don't think any of us were bad, exactly; chalk it up to weakness on my part, hubris on Henry’s, too much Greek prose composition – whatever you like.”

All the characters are morally grey to just generally horrible people, but you completely ignore it because Donna Tartt weaves this hypnotic spell with her writing, that you feel like you are reading this book in a dream like lull. The Secret History is unlike anything I’ve ever read before, and I’m not sure I’ll ever read anything quite like it again. I also want to touch upon sexuality in this book, because a lot of the members in this group are not straight in the slightest. Like, maybe the only ones that were completely straight were Bunny and Camilla. I’m not saying that the queerness in this book is vilified, but it’s for sure not shown in the best of lights. So please use caution while going into this.And this book is so very heavy in general, so please use caution while reading. Content/Trigger warnings for slut shaming, use of the R word, homophobia, hate speech, fatphobic comments, racist comments, animal cruelty, sexual assault, incest, performing rituals, suicide, alcoholism, drug abuse, and murder.I know this review is probably not one of my best, and I know I’m being super vague about all these big themes, but this book is just on a whole other level. Maybe this book is about five new adults dealing with the consequences of murder in a very human and realistic way. Maybe it’s about how we are all just trying to fit in and find family, by whatever unhealthy means available and/or possible. Maybe this book is about birth and death and how important the time between those two points truly is. But I do believe with my whole heart that this book would best be experienced blind, and to just go in and feel all the feelings that Donna Tartt will serve you.While finishing the book, me and Paloma had a discussion about the ending and how Greek heroes’ tales normally go. We talked about how murder taints everything, and how blood is the only thing that can purify it. We talked about how wearing masks is so important, yet death is another mask that we will all eventually wear. God, I’m being so cryptic, but if you’ve read the book maybe this paragraph will mean something to you, because it means the world to me. Overall, I know I sound like a broken record, but this was one of the most unique reading experiences of my life. I honest to God just do not have the words to put in this review how this book made me feel. I will say that it very much feels like a spell is being cast upon you while reading. Like, I am almost positive that Donna Tartt cannot be a human being, because she is such an exclusive enigma. Also, I think I’ve developed a huge crush on her, so there’s that at least. I can say very confidently that I will remember this book, and the feelings it gave me while reading, for the rest of my life. 

“Beauty is rarely soft or consolatory. Quite the contrary. Genuine beauty is always quite alarming.”

2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8178894-nostalgebraist,Rating 1 out of 5,"Thank god it's over. I don't think I can surpass the review Nick wrote earlier tonight, but here goes . . . The good:--This book is well-written, at least in a certain contextless sense. There are many sentences in it (occasionally, even paragraphs) that, if taken by themselves, look like they might have been from a book worth reading.--At least two of the central characters (I'm thinking of Bunny and Henry) are vividly portrayed and interesting figures. (Unfortunately, one of them dies halfway through -- that's not a spoiler, as it's revealed in the prologue -- and the other largely fades from view in the second half.)--There's at least a 200-page stretch in which the book is an exciting page-turner. (Unfortunately, it's over 500 pages long.)The bad:--Besides the two characters mentioned above, the others are frustratingly thin. Francis has no personality traits besides being stereotypically gay; Camilla has no personality traits besides being a generic female love interest (in a completely unappealing subplot that seems to have been included on the Hollywood logic that no story is complete without the protagonist falling in love) and thus having a putatively alluring reticence and mystique; I'm not sure Charles has any discernible personality traits at all. These three characters are rarely absent -- at least one of them appears in virtually every scene -- and given that it's almost impressive how poorly developed they are. Other characters suffer for the opposite reason -- for instance, Julian, the charismatic professor who teaches Greek to the central characters, exerts a supposedly profound influence on their worldviews but barely seems to exist in the story itself.--The story's climax occurs around halfway through, and the remaining ~250 pages are devoted to an absurdly long series of tacky soap opera plotlines that appear and then disappear every 20 pages. The subject matter of these storylines -- incest, drunk driving, stealing drugs from someone's grandmother (!), smoking pot and worrying that someone's mom is going to find out (!!) -- feel so strainingly lurid and/or stereotypically teenage, and so irrelevant to the themes of the first half, that it often felt like some moral tract about Bad Teens Doing Drugs had been spliced onto the end of a totally different book.--The biggest flaw, which was what really ruined the book for me: the style of the narration does not fit the subject matter. This is a book about a group of wealthy and pompous but otherwise ordinary college students committing murder in cold blood. Surely someone looking back on such an act would be plunged into a bunch of somewhat abstract reflections on how they came to do they things they did, what led them to get involved with their co-conspirators, what this all means about them as a person and a moral actor, etc. But that isn't the kind of book Tartt wants to write. She wants to write in a contemporary litfic / creative writing style in which abstract ideas about human behavior are conveyed only implicitly, through character behaviors and well-chosen details — “show, don’t tell.”So you get all these overly mannered descriptions of the narrator noticing some shoes lying on the ground and talking about how the shoes made him feel and so forth, and you just want to say, “okay, but Richard, what does it all mean? I know you must have some big abstract thoughts about what it all means — how could you not? — and I don’t know why won’t you just tell me about them instead of telling me about how the campus looked in spring.” There are narrators for whom this kind of bland immediacy reads as characterization, but in this case it really felt like Tartt was just snapping together two incompatible building blocks -- like she sat down one day and said “I am going to write a ‘literary novel’ and it will be about ‘ordinary people committing murder’ ” and the result was this strange incongruous thing. The book feels so much like a reductio ad absurdum of the conventions of mainstream literary fiction -- the gently controlled narrative voice, the ""deftly chosen"" sensory detail, the distaste for essayistic digressions -- that at times I started to wonder if I was reading a parody of the genre.There are occasional attempts to provide a moral or conceptual gloss on the whole thing, as when, in the very first paragraph, the narrator declares that his ""tragic flaw"" is ""a morbid longing for the picturesque at all costs."" But ideas like this aren't borne out by the narrative itself -- we never get a sense of what the narrator means by ""the picturesque,"" and his bland, passive behavior doesn't seem to be characterized by a ""morbid longing"" for anything. Which brings me to my final point . . .--Lots of wasted potential. Some of the subject matter here is really interesting: say, the idea of people who try to apply an ancient Greek mindset to the modern world, or the question of how a group of initially innocuous people could be led inexorably by circumstance to kill one of their friends. But the whole thing is just so under-analyzed, so unclear about what its ideas are even as it desperately wants to be a book about big, profound ideas. References to the difference between ancient and modern mindsets, or to various interpretations of the murder, are occasionally tossed out but never grow roots; they drown in the ocean of pointless plot. An interesting idea will crop up every 50 pages of so, and Tartt will smother it in its cradle and then write 50 more pages of binge drinking and soap opera convolutions as if in penance. It's telling that Julian, the Greek professor, shows up so rarely, because the book clearly wants to be about his worldview and the effect it had on his students, and if he'd actually made more than a few appearances Tartt might have had to clear up exactly what his worldview was and present some clear, arguable ideas about what it did to these students. What would her creative writing professors make of that? Show, don't tell!"
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/381149-martine,Rating 5 out of 5,"The first paragraph of The Secret History roughly sums up the mood of the book. In it, the narrator, Richard Papen, says that he thinks his fatal flaw is 'a morbid longing for the picturesque at all costs'. If you can relate to these words, chances are you'll love The Secret History. If not, you'll probably wonder what the fuss is all about. Personally, I can totally relate to these words, so I love the book. I've read it over half a dozen times, and while I do think it has its problems, I never fail to find it utterly gripping.The Secret History is both an intellectual novel of ideas and a murder mystery without the whodunnit element. The reader learns right on the first page that Richard and his friends have killed one among their midst. The rest of the book goes on to explain how they came to their gruesome deed and what happened to them afterwards. Against all odds, it makes for compelling reading, despite the fact that you know right from the start who the killers are. Such is the power of Tartt's writing that you find yourself turning page after page, waiting for answers, justifications and possibly a sign of remorse. Once these have been dealt with, the book loses a bit of its power, but until that time, it's near perfect.Donna Tartt's great gift as a writer is her magnificent talent for description. Her evocation of life at a small private university in New England with its oddball mix of ivory-tower intellectuals and ditzy cokeheads is rich in detail, both shocking and funny. If it's not entirely realistic, she makes it so. Likewise, her skill at characterisation is superb. While Richard is not entirely convincing as a male narrator (a fact I find more noticeable every time I re-read the book), he and his friends make up a fascinating cast of characters: six aloof, self-absorbed and arrogant intellectuals who are obsessed with ancient Greece and don't particularly care for modern life. They're snobs and they have major issues, but somehow that only makes them more alluring. Together, they form the ultimate inner circle, the kind of tight-knit group you know should always stay together. Which makes it almost understandable that they should be willing to kill anyone who might jeopardise that group dynamic, incomprehensible though this may seem to the average reader.I can think of many reasons why The Secret History strikes such a chord with me. For one thing, I have a thing for timeless and ethereal stories, and this is one of those. Somehow the book has a dreamlike, almost hypnotic quality, despite it being very firmly set in the rather unromantic 1980s. I love that. For another thing, I have always been drawn to the unabashedly intellectual, and this book has that in spades. It makes geekdom alluring, and I just love Tartt for that. I wish I were as geeky as Henry!Ultimately, what I think I respond to most in The Secret History is the friendship aspect. The Secret History is very much a book about friendship. It's about the very human yearning to belong and be accepted by people we admire. It's about the sacrifices we make to keep friendships intact, the insecurity we feel when we think we might not be completely accepted by our friends after all, and the paranoia we experience when it seems our friends may have betrayed us. About the feeling of invincibility we get from having great friends, and the melancholy and loneliness that follow the disintegration of a once-great friendship. The book basically reads like an elegy on a great friendship, and one doesn't necessarily have to share Richard's intellectual attitude towards life, his morality or even his morbid longing for the picturesque to be able to relate to that. It's enough to have yearned for close friendship and been insecure in friendship. And let's face it, who hasn't?I do not think The Secret History is a perfect book. As I said, I find Richard somewhat unconvincing as a male character; there is too much about him that screams 'female author' to me. Furthermore, the ending is decidedly weak, although to be fair, I have no idea how else Tartt could have finished her book. The story does seem to be inexorably heading in that particular direction. Insofar as the ending reflects the disintegration that is going on in the characters' lives, it could probably be said to be appropriate. Still, I wish Tartt could have come up with something on a par with the rest of the book. If she had, this would have been a six-star book. I don't know many of those."

“If you love one book by a certain author it does not automatically mean you will enjoy all the author’s work” (Me, while reading The Secret History)
.Before I begin my review I have to inform you that Goldfinch is one of my favorite novels. If you want, you can see my short review here. Based on that fact, there should be no doubt in anyone’s mind of how much I love Donna Tartt’s writing. I thought it was perfect in the first novel I read by her, it kept me coming back for more each day, even though the plot was not overly exciting all the time. Although many reviewers are of the opinion that Goldfinch was too long I thought that it could have had 1000 pages and I would have still savored all of them. The Secret History is a different story entirely. I will admit from the beginning that I did not find the subject too enticing when I read the blurb but, nevertheless, I was looking forward to dive into the novel because it was written by the wonderful Donna Tartt. The beautiful writing is still there, that is one of the few reasons that I made it this far. However, I have a few (read many) problems with the content and I will do my best to explain them below. Firstly, we have the insufferable, snobbish, self-absorbed characters. I am not the kind a reader that needs to like the characters but I want them to be interesting and vivid. The six students felt the same to me, even the main character did not possess any special trait. Maybe Bunny was the only one that gave me strong feelings; it almost brought me to the point where I thought it would be a good idea to be killed. The point is, I enjoy well done villains with interior conflicts but there were none to be found here. Secondly, there is the discrepancy between what I understood the book to be about and what it really was. The blurb states that .“Under the influence of their charismatic classics professor, a group of clever, eccentric misfits at an elite New England college discover a way of thinking and living that is a world away from the humdrum existence of their contemporaries"". Let’s begin with the first line, .“under the influence of their charismatic classic professor”. In all the 400 pages that I read I did not see the classic professor as a charismatic character. Actually, the professor was almost non-existent. We are sometimes told about him but when he actually appears in the picture he only has a few flat lines. Oh, and he smiles a lot. I was expecting the teacher and the intellectual conversation between him and the students to have an important presence in the novel, to challenge my thinking, but I was out of luck. I believe we are presented only one discussion from the class, which was essential for the plot, although I did not feel its importance when I read it. We are told about how great and eccentric this professor is but we never actually see it. I was expecting him to be some sort of a disguised devil if he manages to influence his students to commit murder but I do not see how their acts had anything to do with the professor. If anything, he was worried about them when they disappeared for a while and lost contact with them. Going forward, to .“a group of clever, eccentric misfits”. Same problem here, we are told and not showed how smart they were. A .“living that is a world away from the humdrum existence of their contemporaries”. basically means expensive restaurants, a mansion in the countryside and vacation in a palace in Rome. I guess it is a typical existence for people with money, not necessarily something out of ordinary that should deserve our awe. Their first act of “evil” felt underclimatic since, again, we are told about it, we do not actually experience it. It would have been a totally different experience to be there when it happened not to be told by it from a character after a month or so after the deed was done. Finally, I thought there was too much flat, useless dialogue. I wish I had an example to show but I always forget to take notes, sorry.I feel so disappointed for not liking this one but I am not losing my faith in Donna Tartt. I am sure her next book will amaze me once again. "
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/285565-rebecca,Rating 1 out of 5,"This novel, like so many other first novels, is full of everything that the author wants to show off about herself. Like a freshman who annoys everyone with her overbearing sense of importance and unfathomable potential, Donna Tartt wrote this book as though the world couldn't wait to read about all of the bottled-up personal beliefs, literary references, and colorfully apt metaphors that she had been storing up since the age of 17.The most fundamentally unlikable thing about this book is that all of the characters -- each and every one of them -- are snobby, greedy, amoral, pretentious, melodramatic, and selfish. The six main characters are all students at a small and apparently somewhat undemanding college in Vermont, studying ancient Greek with a professor who's so stereotypically gay as to be a homosexual version of a black-face pantomime. In between bouts of translating Greek, the students end up murdering two people, and then devolve into incoherent, drunken, boring decay. The best thing I can equate this book to is the experience of listening to someone else's dream or listening to a very drunk friend ramble on and on and on, revealing a little too much awkward personal information in the process. The climax of The Secret History's narrative was around page 200, but the book was 500 pages long. So, essentially, this book contained 300 pages of scenes where the characters do nothing but drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, go to the hospital for drinking so much alcohol and smoking so many cigarettes, get pulled over for drunk driving, talk about alcohol and cigarettes, do cocaine, and gossip about each other (while drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes).Tartt's writing was sometimes genuinely good at establishing a thrilling and suspenseful mood, but other times, especially toward the end, her writing became the kind of self-conscious, contrived, empty prose that I can imagine someone writing just to fill out a page until a good idea comes to them, kind of like how joggers will jog in place while waiting for a traffic light. That kind of writing practice is fine...as long as the editor is smart enough to cut it before the final copy. The last 300 pages were the authorial equivalent of that kind of jogging while going nowhere, and it soured the whole book for me.In the book's attempt to comment on the privilege, self-interest, and academic snobbery of rich college kids in New England, the book itself comes to be just as self-absorbed and obsessive as its characters -- it turns into a constant litany of unnecessary conversations, sexual tensions that go nowhere, purple prose descriptions of the landscape, contrived plot twists that fizzle out, and forced, overblown metaphors. The confusing part was that Tartt seemed to identify with (and expect us to identify with) these students -- not to admire them for murdering people, obviously, but to respect and envy their precious contempt for everything modern and popular, as though they lived on a higher plane than normal people. The cliche of academic types being remote from the mundane world and out of touch with reality may have a grain of truth to it, but Tartt took that cliche way too far. The story is set in the early 90s, and yet some of the characters had never heard of ATMs, and they still wrote with fountain pens, drove stick shift cars, cultivated roses in their backyards, wore suits and ties to class, and said things like, ""I say, old man!"" Did I mention that this story is set in the early 90s? It got to the point where all the anachronisms came to seem ridiculous and gratuitous. Ostensibly, the point of the novel was to critique the point of view that privileged academics are somehow superior to the average person, but Tartt seemed too enamored of her own characters and the endearing way they held cigarettes between their fingers to really allow that kind of critique to be successful. Maybe Tartt's second novel managed to get away from the claustrophobic selfishness of The Secret History, but I don't feel up to reading it after this."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1246837-maggie-stiefvater,Rating 5 out of 5,"Five Things About The Secret History. This is going to be a difficult book for me to talk about. I finished it days ago but I find myself a little verklempt, I’ll admit. It’s been a long time since a book has stuck with me so completely as this one, and I say that having had a quite remarkable year for memorable reading. So, the summary is straightforward and completely unhelpful: a Californian boy arrives at a private New England college where he falls in with a bunch of snooty but delightful Classics majors who happen to have accidentally killed someone during a Bacchian rite they just happened to be conducting in their spare time. That is a totally truthful depiction of some of the events in the book, but it is not what the book is ABOUT. I will do my best to convince you to pick it up in other ways. Without further ado, here are five things about THE SECRET HISTORY.1. This is not a new book. All of your friends have already read it. You probably already have a copy of it, actually, that you picked up at some point in the last decade, and now it molders in a box in your master bedroom closet, the one that you never unpacked last time you moved. Right next to your college alarm clock and two boxes of 9-volt batteries and that shirt you can’t throw out because it was a gift. The reason why I’m pointing out that it’s not a new book is because, since reading it, I’ve been told by several people that it is their Favorite Book Ever. It is one thing for you to read a book six months before and maintain it as a Favorite Book. It is something more remarkable when a book can elicit a passionate response from readers twenty years after its publication. 2. This book is full of terrible people. Pretty much the lot of the people that our narrator Richard meets are awful in some way. Self-centered or elitist or potheads or sociopathic or just people with really loud voices in quiet places. Even Richard is not exactly a great guy. But the magic of this novel is that, somehow, you find these terrible people deeply sympathetic. I need to go back and reread it to understand this strange enchantment. How do I find them so charming? Why do I want them to like Richard? GIVE ME YOUR SECRETS, BOOK.3. This is not a whodunit. You are told pretty much the Bad Thing That Happens in the prologue, and you can see it coming like a comet for much of the book. The effect of this, however, is to create a lovely, unbearable tension and anticipation. And when the moment comes — in a line that involves ferns — it is so deliciously awful. I actually exhaled gloriously and put the book down for a moment because I was so delighted by the actual pay off. 4. It’s long. It���s over 200,000 words long, I think, and 600 pages in my edition. It took me five days to read it. And it’s not just long, it’s dense. One of the blurbs on the inside of the jacket said that it read like a 19th century novel, and I don’t think that’s at all unearned. It takes its time developing atmosphere and character quirks and some of the days in the novel take dozens of pages to unfold. It is not a novel to speed through. It’s a novel to get stuck in. I put it down when I got too tired, when I felt like I was starting to skim. 5. WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY? I adore the characters so much. I adore the hint —the breath — of the supernatural. I adore the slow, building tension and the sense that I, as a reader, was being skillfully manipulated. Yes, that. That last one. I think that is what I love the most about this novel. I get the idea that Donna Tartt was completely in control of this novel. Everything is measured and deliberate and just perfectly done, and I trust her entirely. Fifty pages in, I knew that she was going to tell me a story I was going to enjoy, even if I had no idea what it was going to be. Man, I just am going to flail about some more. Go read it. "

edit: lowering my rate to 1 star because let's face it: this was awful, and boring as fuck. please, shut the fuck up.
It took me 4 months to finish this book and mostly it was because I was dealing with uni and having several mental breakdowns. Also, the second part of this book was boring as fuck.My review might contain some spoilers!This was a hell of a ride. I don't even know where to begin, but let's try.I've seen a lot of hype for The Secret History everywhere. So, why not give it a try? Plus, it seems cool and the aesthetic is interesting.The first 100 pages, I must admit, were boring. It was really hard for me to get through. I blame uni and the fact that nothing interesting was going on at the moment. The fact that the climax happened around the page 200 or so and then nothing happened pissed me off. And then... That was it. Nothing. Zero. Nada, maldita sea.The only characters that I really liked died, they were Henry... and Bunny. Yes. The annoying bitch who couldn't keep his mouth shut and the only one who really reacted to a murder. Yeah, I agree that he was annoying and was a complete asshole, but was one of the only two who really had personality.The writing was mid... Until it wasn't anymore. The last 150 pages were like Tartt was writing just for the sake of it. Some things were okay, but gods, I was getting sick of those kids getting drunk, smoking like fucking chimneys and getting high. And the consecuences of it: ending up in the hospital or thinking they were going to die. I wish I had been drunk while reading this.I know I shouldn't have, but I laughed way too hard when Henry killed himself. It was so random and so funny. He tried to play the hero card and for what? Honestly, his death wasn't something memorable for me. I mean, yeah, he wasn't pretty bad and I was laughing my ass off when Richard realized that Henry had only told him what he wanted to and not the entire truth, like, how can you be so idiot, Richard? I still can't believe that Donna Tartt decided to put Richard as the mc, or even imagined him at all... This mf was boring as hell.For some reason, her characters are bland, have no personality and are really annoying. Yes, even more than that bitch of Bunny.Anyways, I'm not sorry for rating this book with 0.5 stars. If I could, I would give it 0 stars. But, yes, save yourself."

‘beauty is rarely soft or consolatory. quite the contrary. genuine beauty is always quite alarming.’
and oh, how alarmingly beautiful this story is, as all the best greek tragedies tend to be; full of sorrow and struggle, but often accompanied by pure loyalty and divine inspiration. gosh. i just… i cant even right now. on the surface, this book is great. but donna tartt is an absolute goddess of writing for the sheer depth of this book. its a work of absolute brilliance. i was never a classics student but, as someone who has taken an interest in the subject over the years, i cant even express my geeky joy for how multifaceted and layered this story is. by exemplifying fatal flaws, dissecting the apollonian vs. dionysian philosophical theory, personalising the mask of death, understanding the action and stagnation of life, and realising the lifelong quest for the picturesque, this story is a modern greek tragedy and a classic in its own right. wow. i will be thinking about this book for quite some time.↠ 4.5 stars"

19,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4593541-barry-pierce,Rating 3 out of 5,"Due to my utter adoration for The Goldfinch I decided, for reasons unbeknownst to even myself, that I should give The Secret History another go. See I read it maybe four years ago, I want to say, and I wasn’t the biggest fan. And ever since then I’ve had people constantly telling me just how wrong I was about The Secret History. ‘No, no, it’s a modern classic!’ they’d say to me. Or, ‘wow it seems exactly like the type of book you’d adore.’ And they’re right, it is exactly the type of book I’d adore. So why can I not bring myself around to loving it?The Secret History is very much a tale of two novels, the split between them coming when Bunny dies. And that isn’t a spoiler, we’re told in the first line that Bunny dies. The first book being the lead up and the second book being the aftermath, with the group just trying to deal with the fact that they actually killed Bunny. Once again, not a spoiler, we’re told on the first page that the group kill Bunny. And if you don’t like even the first pages of novels being spoiled then I suggest you should go outside more often.Side note: it’s rather depressing to read this novel when you’re the same age as the characters. I felt so under-read. But then I remembered they’re all fictional, so fuck them.The first book is actually quite good. It’s all wonderfully tense as the reader is just waiting for the murder to happen. The inverted murder mystery, which oftentimes does not work, works fantastically here and you wouldn’t be talked over if you referred to The Secret History as perhaps the best example of the whydunit genre. Then my biggest problem with the novel happens: the entire second half. What a fucking slog. Like, jesus. Okay Donna just because you’re writing about a funeral doesn’t mean that the novel itself has to become funereal. The whole book just becomes ‘oh aren’t we really sad!’ and ‘ugh it’s tough being murderers!’ And I think, tell me if I’m wrong here, I think Tartt expects us to sympathise with these fucking monsters. I mean, I’ve sympathised with murderers before. I think Aileen Wuornos had a fairly sound motive. The Unabomber made some good points. But this ragtag group of Enid Blyton rejects? Nah. Not a chance.So what do I think of The Secret History the second time around? Much the same as the first time really. I did enjoy some parts more, especially the first half. I’ll be kind, I’ll bump my star rating up one. Congrats Donna, I now think your first novel is perfectly average! I’m happy for us both.Oh, and isn’t Judy Poovey just the greatest name of a fictional character in the history of Western literature? Judy Poovey. I want to get to know you."

Then, they're shockingly ho-hum about the entire thing because after all it was just some random farmhand or something who just accidentally happened to be around. They never ever discuss this murder. They don't even really feel bad about it until someone threatens to expose them. Plus, instead of ever discussing the potentially interesting details of their ritual, the book instead chooses to focus on the most boring aspects of the aftermath. There's an entire chapter devoted to a road trip which really needs to be cut out and replaced with: ""Yeah, so, we all went to Bunny's funeral. His family was pretty much what we expected.""There's a division between the first half of this book and the second half. I was really drawn in to the first half but as soon as the second half begins, it all goes downhill right until the ending which is the worst part of the whole stupid thing.

Within this microcosm, they are creating their own norms and in time, their own morality, which leads to a descent to evil.A masterclass in scene setting and character development from a first person narrator's perspective; in beautifully paced suspense building; and in creating an atmosphere and plot that aptly illustrates the general complexity and confusion of relationships. The well drawn out character development by Tartt, brings the group to life, despite the at first glance, limited view of the narrator. One of those books you can read again and again, and again... and still be completely drawn in by the suspense and the mystery of it all.Tart announces her talent to the world! 10 out of 12."

Someday. But not anytime soon. It was so sad. And fucking depressing. The conversations were sooo interesting to me. It’s was like having conversations I would never have with someone in the first place. Stronger in the sense that writing was SOOOO FUCKING GOOD!!!! The fact that she writes in way where its easy to articulate and understand that I wouldn’t be able to in an actual real life conversation is astounding to me. I couldn’t even tell it was taking place in the 80s; a true classic, still living up and strong to this day— timeless. I liked this book. And then I really hated it. Bunny can go die. Well he did. And I don’t condone murder but this book made me feel so conflicted overall. It’s passionate, considerate, pretentious, arrogant, and somewhat chaotic read. Also very cold and lifeless— not in a bad way per se. Richard is honestly a really boring character, nothing that makes him stand out BUT the ordeal he went through and his need to belong gives him that edge that makes me give a second look. I can definitely see why people have a love/hate relationship this book. It was really distinct outlook on character relationships- driven and heavy. Pretentious and tedious. Reminded me of A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara and a little of Ninth House by Leigh Bardugo. 4 STARS. Twitter | Bookstagram | Youtube |"

24,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65321843-a,Rating 5 out of 5,"I don't know about you, but what I strive for is finding my next great read. They're not always perfect. Sometimes they have messed up shit in them, BUT they leave me dumbfounded and in awe. Days after I find myself doing something completely mundane and unable to stop thinking about the story and the characters. That's what The Secret History did to me. 
I suppose at one time in my life I might have had any number of stories, but now there is no other. This is the only story I will ever be able to tell.
The Secret History follows Richard Papen as he transfers from California to Hampden College in New England. He joins a small elite group who study Greek and are obsessed with the classics—taught by an eccentric and mysterious professor who teaches them a different way of thinking. “Everything was going beautifully, on the brink of taking wing, and I had a feeling that I'd never had, that reality itself was transforming around us in some beautiful and dangerous fashion, that we were being driven by a force we didn't understand, towards an end I did not know.”Richard recounts the events that lead up to the murder of one of his classmates and all that happens after. Never, never once in any immediate sense, did it occur to me that any of this was anything but a game. An air of unreality suffused even the most workaday details, as if we were plotting not the death of a friend but the itinerary of a fabulous trip that I, for one, never quite believed we'd ever really take.My thoughts:When I saw that my copy was over 600 pages (super thin and flimsy might I add, I almost tore them by mistake like a dozen times) I was a tiny bit daunted. The only genre in which I'm used to reading such big books is fantasy. But I quickly fell in love with the writing which was both beautiful and lyrical and was, despite my initial assumptions, actually quite accessible. This book was told in the first person but in past tense. It reminded me a lot of The Great Gatsby and the way that book was narrated. The plot was slow, full of rich detail and atmospheric. A lot of parts (especially in the beginning now that I think on it) were not relevant or necessary to the story but I think I loved it more because of the attention to detail and the way Richard talks about comepletey normal, every day things he did. The setting and characters were so well fleshed out, it allowed me to connect to the story despite how problematic the characters were. In a certain sense, this was why I felt so close to the others in the Greek class. They, too, knew this beautiful and harrowing landscape, centuries dead; they'd had the same experience of looking up from their books with fifth-century eyes and finding the world disconcertingly sluggish and alien, as if it were not their home.I'm not going to lie— all the characters were terrible people. But I couldn't help sympathising with them at times. From the first page we are told about the murder this group of friends commit. This is not a happy story, it is a story about murder and the consequences that they have to face, a stain on their souls they have to bear. But while I have never considered myself a very good person, neither can I bring myself to believe that I am a spectacularly bad one. Perhaps it's simply impossible to think of oneself in such a way, our Texan friend being a case in point. What we did was terrible, but still I don't think any of us were bad, exactly; chalk it up to weakness on my part, hubris on Henry's, too much Greek prose composition – whatever you like.There were times I felt sad and empathised with them and other times I felt utterly disgusted. Donna Tartt does not shy away from harsh truths. This book is filled with jaw dropping plot twists and situations that had me crying, and gasping out loud.I read this book in autumn, sometimes under a tree with a gentle breeze in the fall sunlight and sometimes snuggled in bed with copious cups of coffee to keep me reading through the night. I 10/10 recommend reading it this way. It is not a book for devouring in one sitting, but rather a book slowly savoured. I know this review is probably inadequate and does not fully capture my thoughts, but it is the best I can do right now. 
One likes to think there's something in it, that old platitude amor vincit omnia. But if I've learned one thing in my short sad life, it is that that particular platitude is a lie. Love doesn't conquer everything. And whoever thinks it does is a fool.
Buddy read with my fav Türkan ✨ __Initial reaction:And as I'm sitting on my wingbacked chair, I take a sip of my (now cold) black coffee. I turn the last page. I am a tumult of emotions.

I used to think it didn’t. Now I think it does. And I think that mine is this: a morbid longing for the picturesque at all costs.""Hot damn this book was brilliant! I’m officially joining the ranks of Donna Tartt fans. Three things happened after I finished this book: 1) I wanted to start all over again 2) I had difficulty reading the books I chose next (even though they are excellent in their own right) 3) I couldn’t figure out how the hell to write this review! I’ve actually been afraid to read Tartt. I mean, what if I didn’t love her like everyone else? How was I going to explain that?! And now I can’t seem to coherently express why I admired her writing so much in this book. I’ll start perhaps with that quote above and that ""morbid longing for the picturesque at all costs."" I can totally relate to that. Perhaps not ""at all costs"", however. Richard, a middle-class Californian and the narrator of The Secret History, thirsts for the intellectual and glamorous life. More importantly, he’s searching for a place to belong; he yearns for what he believes to be ‘his people.’ Sounds familiar, right? And perhaps a bit clichéd? Well, there’s certainly nothing ordinary about this story. It’s intelligently crafted, and the reader is drawn right into the book alongside Richard. I can’t say I liked Richard, but for 500+ pages, I lived outside of my little world and smack dab in the middle of Richard’s. The setting is perfect and beautifully described – a small liberal arts college in rural Vermont. ""Even now I remember those pictures, like pictures in a storybook one loved as a child. Radiant meadows, mountains vaporous in the trembling distance; leaves ankle-deep on a gusty autumn road; bonfires and fog in the valleys; cellos, dark windowpanes, snow.""Then there are the characters! Richard somehow manages to edge into the small, exclusive Greek classics program run by the very enigmatic professor, Julian. The classics students, Richard included, see him definitely as a father-like figure, something each seemed to be lacking in their personal lives; but furthermore, he was nearly a god-like personage in their eyes. Richard is immediately attracted to this eccentric yet alluring group - Henry, Francis, Bunny, and the twins, Camilla and Charles. ""… different as they all were they shared a certain coolness, a cruel, mannered charm which was not modern in the least but had a strange cold breath of the ancient world: they were magnificent creatures, such eyes, such hands, such looks—sic oculos, sic ille manus, sic ora ferehat.""What do you do when you feel disillusioned and bored with your daily life? What happens when you are under the spell of a charismatic nature like Julian’s? Naturally, the group is easily swayed by his words. Even after finishing the last page of this novel, I still ask the question to what extent was Julian responsible, either directly or indirectly, for the actions of these students.""Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it. And what could be more terrifying and beautiful, to souls like the Greeks or our own, than to lose control completely?""I won’t get into the rest of the plot. We are told from the very beginning that there is a murder and that this group is responsible. But this is not an ordinary whodunit, as we know this fact from page one. It’s all about the thrilling suspense leading up to the event as well as the gripping psychological tension. The claustrophobic feeling held me in its tight embrace throughout the second half or last third of the novel. There are certainly overtones of Crime and Punishment within. It also brought to mind the feeling I had while reading The Talented Mr. Ripley. How could I actually find myself siding with the villain(s)? There was such a feeling of intimacy that Tartt created between the reader and Richard in this book, much like Highsmith did between the reader and Tom Ripley in her book. It’s ingenious!The Secret History is one of my favorite reads of the year, and will also sit on my favorites of all time shelf. It’s a literary thriller at its finest. As I was reading this on my kindle, I didn’t actually pay attention to the number of pages before I started. When I finished, I couldn’t believe this was actually 500+ pages. I could have read more! I had been about to start reading The Goldfinch, but I have to thank my friend Pedro who convinced me that this one should be first. I’m certain this would have deserved 5 stars regardless of the order of reading, but I’m fully confident that his advice was wise! Now I can’t wait to continue my Tartt adventures.""I suppose at one time in my life I might have had any number of stories, but now there is no other. This is the only story I will ever be able to tell."""

29,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416832-joe-hill,Rating 4 out of 5,"Someone just brought up Nietzsche’s Apollonian vs. Dionysian theory, which is described at the link below, if you are as unfamiliar as I was. http://www.geocities.com/danielmacrya...Apparently Donna Tartt was well-versed in this theme, as it is prevalent in The Secret History. The gist of Nietzsche’s theory is that the ancient Greeks attained such a high level of culture mainly due to their personal struggle between the opposing philosophies of Apollo and Dionysus; Apollo being the god of art, and thus, stagnation, while Dionysus is the god of debauchery and barbarism, and thus, action. This struggle between appreciation for art and culture and a zeal for living is what Nietzsche credits for the Greeks impressive progress. He also believed that the only way we can progress today is to swing the pendulum toward Dionysus.I see Tartt’s Greek professor character as Apollonian—beautiful and seemingly wise, but in the end, shallow, and useless in times of tragedy. His students loved him, but they (or Henry, at least) realized the inherent stagnation in pouring over ancient texts and art--they needed a Dionysian push to move them forward to real progress. This is a rather obvious observation, I think it is even spelled out by the Henry character in the novel. However, the basis for Nietzsche’s theory, which I’m now sure Tartt was aware of, is that the basic will of humans is not to simply survive, but to survive at a level superior to that of your peers. Knowing this adds new colors to the tableau Tartt weaved for us, a story that is ultimately about class struggle (ala Philip Roth, hence, the faux-snubb reference). I think it tells us how carefully Tartt chose her vehicle for this story and reveals a little more of her brilliance."
30,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59357213-sam,Rating 5 out of 5,"I understand why The Secret History is loathed as much as it is loved. If I remove myself a bit from what I just read, I note implausible dialogue and somewhat unbelievable plot elements, horrifically selfish and nasty main characters, overflowing with evil, sure, but mostly with ennui and snobbery and drunkenness and poor-little-rich-people and an air of erudition that's more smokescreen than substance.I can admit to all of that objectively. Subjectively, I feverishly read this in a day and found it literally unputdownable, obscuring my copy under my desk to finish the last 50 pages at work. I can't tell if I suspended my disbelief, or fully believed and drank the Kool-Aid, or some combination of both. All I can say is that this book seized hold of me and refused to let go, lured me and seduced me with Tartt's picturesque, poetic language and description, the sustained tension and ominous mood, and the intricacies of the dark, feral, brutal natures and impulses that lurk underneath beautiful, polished surfaces. I was compelled to savor the details, but also desperate to turn the pages and read more. I was by turns irritated, disgusted, sympathetic, contemplative of the relationships and actions and reactions of Henry, Bunny, Francis, Charles and Camilla, and though I wouldn't say any rank among the more memorable characters I've read, they ended up being as magnetic as Richard the narrator first found them to be, even if in the end I was repelled by them rather than attracted. I could not look away, I was completely captured and in their and Tartt's spell. And I came to satisfied and unsettled by my satisfaction, as though I shouldn't have liked or enjoyed or been so captivated by such a tale. This book is wicked. I can see how wicked can mean evil/unpleasant, or a New England style excellent for this read, and completely understand its polarizing nature. If you haven't read The Secret History yet and are debating about it, I'd recommend trying it if you're a fan of dense literary novels and don't always need a moral paragon to root for. And if you do decide to pick it up, I can only urge to try as hard as you can to suspend your disbelief and get caught in the web... I can't tell if I devoured it or it devoured me, or both, but either way I loved this wicked book. 4.5 stars rounded up to 5 stars, with a future re-read all but guaranteed."

Does such a thing as ‘the fatal flaw’, that showy dark crack running down the middle of a life, exist outside literature? I used to think it didn’t. Now I think it does. And I think that mine is this: a morbid longing for the picturesque at all costs.

 For Richard, this starts after he moves from Plano, California to Hampden College. Even the name had an austere Anglican cadence, to my ear at least, which yearned hopelessly for England and was dead to the sweet dark rhythms of the little mission towns. There he meets Greek students Henry, Francis, the twins: Charles and Camilla, and Bunny. Or as their Classics instructor, budding cult leader, Julian describes them: genis gratus, corpore glabellus, arte multiscius, et fortuna opulentus-- smooth-cheeked, soft-skinned, well-educated, and rich. This is a character driven book and has one of the most vibrant examinations of the human condition I’ve ever come across. Most notable, for me at least is Henry. Part Sherlock Holmes, part Regina George… he was remarkable, evocative, admirable and the kind of man I’d need to microdose on should I want to enjoy him recreationally. A lot of the muslin-thin plot is driven by Henry’s decision making (yes, Richard is a one-note observer of the life and times of these notorious five but he’s still a stout narrator).I fell in love with Henry when he was asked how he could so casually justify premeditated murder. 
“But how,” said Charles, who was close to tears, “how can you possibly justify cold-blooded murder?”Henry lit a cigarette, “I prefer to think of it,” he had said, “as redistribution of matter.”
 This story gains its wheels once Richard gains entry into the core friendship. As the modern day narrator Richard is recollecting these tragic events that occurred while he was at college, he tells us: 
“It is easy to see things in retrospect, but I was ignorant then of everything but my own happiness, and I don’t know what else to say except that life itself seemed very magical in those days: a web of symbol, coincidence, premonition, omen. Everything, somehow, fit together, some sly and benevolent Providence was revealing itself by degrees and I felt myself trembling on the brink of a fabulous discovery…”
 I was so hooked and eager to see what they would do. Even if it was just accompanying them in their day-to-day life. Even their classes were fun to sit in on. Their comparisons of Roman and Greek philosophies, their vague romanticizing of Bacchanalia, 
“Beauty is terror. We want to be devoured by it, to hide ourselves in that fire which refines us.”
 But perhaps this book’s greatest strength is how remarkably easy it is to read. I went in expecting dense prose and drowning by vocabulary but apart from the odd word or turn of Latin phrase, this book was easy to devour. It was also very descriptive. Tartt has a way with words that is both immersive and ambient. Not only was I right there in the room with Richard as he shared with me his story, I could feel what every character on page was feeling. Tartt’s prose leaves a lot for the reader to infer and there’s nothing I love more than an author who can trust their audience. The most vivid thing for me was how what Richard found so beautiful in the beginning unearths itself to be rotten to the core. In his inadvertent journey of self-discovery after all the unpleasant things they do (like a naked forest ritual to invoke Dionysus that results in tragedy), Richard watches as this facade slowly unravels itself. His esteemed friends are a highly flawed lot. Even the bombastic sybarite Bunny who was at first fun turned out to be bigoted and with an annoying habit of leaving his friends with an inflated bill. This is a story about a man who got himself caught up in a world he couldn’t escape. (I wouldn't want to either. Who doesn't want wealthy friends with country estates where we can indulge in creative drug use, gourmet coffee, and have civil discussions about the validity of Plato's definition of justice). But even after his golden friends lost their glitter, Richard saw the futility of getting out. 
Without warning I had a vision of Francis- twenty years later, fifty years, in a wheelchair. And of myself- older, too, sitting around with him in some smokey room, the two of us repeating this exchange for the thousandth time. At one time I had liked the idea, that the act, at least, had bound us together, we were not ordinary friends, but friends till-death-do-us-part. This thought had been my only comfort in the aftermath… Now it made me sick, knowing there was no way out. I was stuck with them, with all of them, for good.
 This is a book that will stay with me for years. Often, when I was revisiting my notes I would find myself rereading and would have to stop myself because other books exist that deserve to be read. A whydunnit tale, about a group of students who cause death and destruction in their pursuit to see god but still have to worry about their Greek homework is one of the greatest books I've ever read.
Consummatum est.

32,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18922532-ilenia-zodiaco,Rating 5 out of 5,"La letteratura è più efficace di un’arma da fuoco. Un proiettile segue una traiettoria breve. Colpisce in un istante. Ultimata la parabola, si conficca nel bersaglio e perde la sua efficacia. La letteratura invece ha un raggio d’azione potenzialmente infinito. Donna Tartt, ad esempio, nel 1992 ha scritto il suo Dio di illusioni (titolo originale: The secret history) e oggi nel 2013 le sue parole come frecce scagliate da un altrove lontano, hanno raggiunto e colpito il mio petto. Il potere strabiliante delle idee. Dio di illusioni è un romanzo formidabile. La storia è un susseguirsi di rivelazioni, ma non come potrebbe accadere in un thriller. La narrazione piuttosto si avvicina agli schemi della tragedia greca. E il dio di illusioni del titolo è proprio il dio greco Dioniso. “Maestro d’illusione, rende capaci i suoi devoti di vedere il mondo come non è”. La vicenda è ambientata in un elitario college nel Vermont in cui si reca Richard Papen, squattrinato e inquieto giovane, narratore degli eventi. Si lascerà affascinare da un gruppo di cinque brillanti ed eccentrici studenti di greco antico e dal loro professore, Julian, un esteta che esercita sugli allievi una forte seduzione spirituale. Julian contagerà i giovani discepoli con la sua passione per quel mondo antico e misterioso. Un mondo in cui l’irrazionale, il dionisiaco non erano tabù. “È un’idea tipica dei greci, e molto profonda. Bellezza è terrore. Ciò che chiamiamo bello ci fa tremare. E cosa potrebbe essere più terrificante e più bello che perdere ogni controllo?”. Ma instillare queste idee di superamento del reale, in giovani ricchi e annoiati che si sentono onnipotenti non si limita ad essere una dissertazione filosofica. Si trasformerà in una sfida, un gioco pericoloso. Nelle vite dei ragazzi, tra gli stordimenti di alcol e droga, si affaccerà il fantasma della violenza e della depravazione. Il romanzo della Tartt si concentra su un’attenta riflessione sul male, condotta dall’interno. Il narratore infatti è un inside man. Richard Papen è un piccolo borghese californiano, un infiltrato nell’elitario circolo di Julian. La sua non appartenenza crea attorno al ristretto simposio una cortina di fascino e attrazione. Julian assume una statura mitica: mentore, figura paterna, ultimo baluardo di bellezza e grazia in una società prosaica e grigia. Henry, i gemelli Charles e Camilla, Francis e Bunny appaiono agli occhi di Richard inarrivabili. Ricchi, bellissimi, onnipotenti. Richard si lascia catturare dal magnetismo dei colti studenti di lingua e cultura greca. Il mondo classico si rivela essere una dimensione magica, di gran lunga più profonda della sua vita che percepisce come spenta e mediocre. Richard, apparentemente insensibile e apatico, si risveglia dal suo torpore e si avvicina grazie alle lezioni di Julian a questo “bellissimo e tormentoso paesaggio, morto da secoli”. Mentre però Richard è un turista ammirato di quel mondo, Julian e soprattutto Henry ne erano abitatori permanenti. Il mondo a noi noto, il mondo del presente, non era la loro vera casa. Studiando le forze incontrollabili che s’impadronivano degli antichi greci durante i baccanali, bramosi d’impadronirsi essi stessi di quelle forze, di raggiungere quello stato di estasi e di riconoscere il sentimento del sublime, i discepoli di Julian coltiveranno un’illusione. L’illusione di ricreare un’epoca remota, l’illusione di essere sganciati dai ritmi e dalla morale che regola il presente. Ingannati dalle loro stesse menti, accecate da un delirio di onnipotenza, i ragazzi si getteranno in dinamiche di gruppo degeneranti che sfoceranno in un atto di brutale violenza. The secret history è però un romanzo che non si concentra tanto sull’atto di depravazione, sulla malvagità, quanto su “l’infinità di trucchi grazie ai quali il male si presenta come bene”. Tanto più che i protagonisti hanno un’età vulnerabile (e quanto suona ironico questo aggettivo riferito a tali personaggi!) e sono incapaci di scorgere la trappola in cui sono finiti. La narrazione è estremamente soggettiva e poco lucida. Sia perché il narratore fa spesso uso di sostanze stupefacenti, sia perché egli stesso è continuamente ingannato dalla natura dei personaggi e delle loro azioni. Il racconto procede per ribaltamenti. Chi prima sembrava la vittima, si rivela il carnefice. Ciò che prima appare sublime e lirico, si trasforma in torbida scelleratezza. Le illusioni attorno alle personalità dei personaggi vengono squarciate. Lo stesso romanzo è una continua rivelazione. Sguscia via da qualsiasi definizione di genere. Ha molti elementi del giallo, del thriller, del romanzo psicologico, del romanzo di formazione. Sarebbe fare un torto alla scrittrice racchiuderlo in un’etichetta. La Tartt intreccia l’interrogativo sul fascino del male con il rapporto tra moralità e denaro. Il fatto che i protagonisti appartengano a delle famiglie abbienti (nonostante non abbiano tutti lo stesso livello di agiatezza) è fondamentale. Perché l’azione che i protagonisti compiono è causata da una sorta di distanza dall’ordinario, la solida certezza di appartenere ad un genio superiore. Il denaro li inebria, li fa sentire diversi, migliori, onnipotenti. Ma soprattutto annoiati. Grazie ai soldi di Henry, che non dà alcuna importanza alle contingenze materiali proprio perché troppo ricco per preoccuparsene, i protagonisti diventano in un certo modo insensibili alla vita normale. Si sentono sempre più attratti dall’idea di trasgressione, di vitalità. Diventa un’ossessione: la ricerca di oblio, di un atto che possa ancora di più svincolarli dalla quotidianità e concedergli un singulto vero, difficile da trovare nelle alterazioni di farmaci e altre sostanze inebrianti, a cui ormai sono assuefatti. Quello che però potrebbe sembrare un romanzo nichilista (nel senso positivo e vitalistico che gli attribuiva Nietzsche) in realtà cova un severo giudizio morale. Il vero tema del romanzo non è un cinico atto superomistico bensì il senso di colpa. I protagonisti dalla loro perversione non troveranno altro che alienazione e sofferenza. Non quella terribile bellezza che gli antichi greci provarono nella liberazione di ogni istinto. Non reggono il fardello delle loro azioni (“Mi sentii addosso tutta l’amara, irrevocabile realtà della nostra azione, la sua malvagità”). Non superuomini, ragazzi dietro i cui atti si cela egoismo, marciume, perfidia. La bellezza è crudele, khalepà tà kalà. “Forse avrebbe considerato quei delitti come delle cose tristi folli tormentate pittoresche (Ho fatto tutto, si vantava il vecchio Tolstoj, anche uccidere un uomo) invece che atti fondamentalmente egoistici e malvagi quali erano”. La scrittrice statunitense costruisce un romanzo che è non solo una forte denuncia del vuoto, del potere alienante di una ricchezza, non supportata da altri valori ma anche un romanzo di disillusione e crescita. Descrive perfettamente il passaggio dalla nebulosità e irrequietezza dell’adolescenza ad uno stadio adulto.

He drank a lot of rum, talked rot about Neitzsche and foreign existentialist movies we'd never seen, then spent five hours puking into the bath. Yeah, we weren't impressed. Same with this stupid novel."
34,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17568354-eliza,Rating 5 out of 5,"2019The fact that I STILL think about this book every other week really makes me to want to label this as my #1 favorite book. It's literally the best thing I have read up until this point. What a mind-blowing novel.________________________________________Re-read in 2018Still flipping amazing. I. Love. This. Book.________________________________________5/5 Stars!EDIT: I read this about two months ago, but I'm still thinking about it! Therefore, I bumped it up half a star, and changed my overall rating to 5 stars. This is seriously such an amazing novel.REVIEW:THIS WAS AMAZING! I swear, I took forever to read this (thank you, college), however, every time I picked it up, I could not get enough of it. The writing and characters were just superb, and I'm honestly quite upset to have finished this. 'Cause what else is going to hold my attention as well as this novel did?I've never read Donna Tartt's The Goldfinch (her most known work), but I'm going to have to pick it up now. Though, I do wonder if that novel will stand a chance against this one. One of the main reasons this novel held my attention was because it wasn't a ""who done it"" book, but rather a, ""why done it."" I'm not too fond of mystery novels, however, there was something so sinister and addictive about this book that I really didn't mind the mystery aspects. They were quite wonderful, and only added sparingly.I understand that some of you might pick this book up after my review, and some of you might not (your loss!). But if you do decide to give it a chance, I hope you will appreciate the descriptive and lovely writing that Tartt uses to slowly and steadily pull the reader in. I know there are some of you who won't have the patience for this novel, and that upsets me. However, I really think everyone should give it a chance. These characters - though extremely flawed and messed up - are the sort you will never forget. Honestly, this story is one you'll never forget. It's corrupt and terrible and nonsensical, but oh so addictive.Overall, Donna Tartt has just become an instant-buy author for me. I'm absolutely in love with her writing and her characters, and I cannot wait to read more of her work!"
35,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36538861-elle,Rating 5 out of 5,"posted my annotations & annotation guide for the secret history on my bookstagram! also my review.i will probably be posting chapter by chapter reading guides on my instagram so stay tuned!⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻here is the very long awaited review of one of my favorite books.i first read the secret history for class in high school, then two times after that. it is, without a doubt, always in my top 5 list of books. i’m sure i’m not special in that case, because this book is a true testament to the genius and beauty of english literature.i can say a thousand and one things about this book, post my many essays i’ve written on it, and it still would not be enough. every flick of a page in this book makes me feel like i’m slowly unravelling layers of something huge, something so very intricate. this took donna tartt 10 years to write, and everyone who reads it can absolutely tell why.the secret history centers around richard, a transfer student to hamden college, a liberal arts college in new england. it centers around a group of students and their classics professor and the murder of one of their classmates. it explores themes of beauty, hedonism, moral corruption, and the very slow descent into madness.i don’t want to say anything about the plot because the best way to go into this book is to go into it blind. instead, i want to talk about the writing. the writing!!! i will never be able to shut up about how fantastic it is. with the goldfinch but more so the secret history, it is easy to tell that this isn’t just a book, it is an art form waiting to be consumed.it’s insane just how much love this book has gotten, especially in the last year because of the ‘dark academia’ vibe it gives off. but this book is so much more than that, and sometimes i wish people wouldn’t get wholly swept away in the vibe of the book that they lose track of the attention to detail and expert character/world building.i have read this three times, and in the times that i did, i was living, breathing, and eating the secret history 24/7. i was living inside of these pages, and i never wanted to leave. tartt has the brilliant capability to immerse and entrap you into her narrative to the point where when you finish reading, you enter a sort of fugue state for a bit because readjusting to reality is hard.that’s my favorite part of reading a book that is genuinely so perfect. the part where, when you finish, you wonder just how you’re supposed to go back to living your day to day life.⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻
pre-reread
rereading because why live if you're not going to reread the secret history annually? my chronic rereading disease persists into 2022.also entertaining because i'm looking at annotations i made at 17 as an almost 22 year old and my thoughts are largely the same. have i just not matured? stay tuned to find out.at one point in chapter one where richard wrote that he was vaguely marxist, i wrote ""materialistic king seems pretty capitalist to me!"" and i stand by that.⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻can you believe that i have read this book three times and i still cannot come up with a good enough review to describe how much i love this book?i've been trying for four years, guys."
36,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,Rating 3 out of 5,"Shortly after starting this book I Wikipedia'd Donna Tartt, to see if I was dealing with some sort of reverse George Eliot; I had been under the impression that only men got as smugly pretentious as Tartt does. But no, she's a real lady! Ask Bret Easton Ellis, whom she was banging at U. Miss while in a grad writing course that also included Jonathan Lethem and Jill Eisenstadt, so that is a whopping lot of talent in one course, and also Bret Easton Ellis.And you sortof start to wonder, did he start a competition with Donna Tartt about who could write a book featuring the most douchebags? Did they have a douchebag contest going? That would certainly explain American Psycho. It's the literary douchebag crane kick.Anyway, I guess Tartt's a great writer, because she does a terrific job of inhabiting the sort of insufferable, pedantic twit who brags about knowing the locative case in Greek. Oh, me and my clever little friends! We wear cuff links and read Seneca and describe our ex-girlfriends as ""A lowbrow, pop-psychology version of Sylvia Plath...all the clinging, all the complaints, all the parking-lot confessions of 'inadequacy' and 'poor self-image,' all those banal sorrows."" Which is a shitty thing for a dude to say, y'know? And, again, Donna Tartt isn't even a dude.It settles down, a bit, after the first quarter or so, into a passably competent thriller-type-thing. Murder and such. It's reasonably entertaining. A bit fixated on ""hippies,"" which word appears 23 times and always with negative connotations, so that's weird, but whatever. I guess we all have our boogeymen. It gets - to use my girlfriend's word, which made me want to just hug the shit out of her - super ""plotty"" towards the end, which was good, but I felt a little let down by the denouement; I was kinda hoping for some huge revelation, like everyone was scheming to frame Richard, or Julian was in on it, or some crazy shit like that, so just having Henry shoot himself was, like...not plotty enough for me? I don't know, that's unfair of me to say but it's how I felt.I've heard people say that the neat thing about Secret History is how it shines a realistic light on what it really means to murder a guy. Like, away with the murder mystery cliches, here's how it happens, and the family's funeral, and everything. And she kinda does, and I can appreciate that. But she gets to it by cheating, doesn't she? They get into this situation because they've already killed the other guy, whom they hadn't planned to kill. So it's not about how normal people might interact with murder - it's how normal people who already killed a guy during a Bacchanalian orgy might interact with murder, the next time. That's not the same, and it's not actually realistic either. It's only happened to me like two or three times, and I found it way easier to cover up than these guys did.Maybe I just don't have any friends like Bunny."

It poses the question: Why do we believe what we believe? This lecture from Yale asserts that our beliefs are shaped by our social and economic positions as well as by our history.Most people used to believe the world was flat. Why wouldn’t they believe that it was round?Now, amidst this academic exercise, I read The Secret History. Upon my first read, I loved The Secret History, but I couldn’t remember what happened.The Secret History was Donna Tartt’s debut novel, and it caused an unheard of bidding war between publishers. Ultimately, it was purchased for $450,000 (at least according to 1,0001 Books You Must Read Before You Die).From the very first page, we know there is a murder and the identity of the victim. Our narrator, Richard, is a broke college student who gets into a decent university and bluffs his way into a very elite Greek program. The class consists of only 6 students, and the professor will personally guide each student to helpful texts.The idea of a highly personalized education is so enchanting that I spent most of the novel in a blissful daze. In interviews, Tartt spoke about her time at Bennington College, a private liberal arts college in Vermont. During her school days, Tartt joined a writing group where half of the members are now published authors. Some of them are quite famous. However, she pointed out that Bennington College is not what it used to be. It is now under a new administration, and many of her professors are no longer working there.Although I am not well versed with the specifics of Bennington College, I did attend Michigan State University. Some classes had 200+ people. How much individual attention did I receive? How much meaningful commentary could I receive on my papers? What would I have become if I was in a class of six with a professor who was fully devoted to enhancing my education and writing?And, in the past, this would have been enough for me.But it isn’t anymore.While Tartt’s intellectual musings through our narrator Richard are intriguing, she rambles too much. Even in her interviews, her answers weren’t succinct. The interviewer would either cut her off or redirect her. She is so brilliant and dazzling that she can readily speak her mind.However, it is 2023, the era of TikTok and Instagram. Did you know that many Instagram reels are 5 seconds or less? 5 seconds, cut down to soundbites.Having the attention span of a goldfish, The Secret History is 100-200 pages too long for this academic-loving bookworm.Connect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta"

Sand—“no. just no. cut the cameras. i honestly try not to let stuff like this get to me because it’s unhealthy and you can’t control other’s actions. but it’s upsetting to see how much support and money this author gets from such a disgusting book, and the rest of the work she publishes. i understand it was written in 1992, but this book continues to be extremely popular and comes up highly recommended in the book community which is disappointing. not to mention the fact that even her later work continues to include these same slurs. even more so than in this book. not all copies of this book included the N word, but it was especially horrific to hear it in the audiobook form coming out of the author’s mouth. the fact that the slurs were removed from more recent copies just continues to push her work while completely ignoring the issues. here’s an idea: how about remove the book as a whole? there’s nothing worthwhile in there. there is no reason the bigotry in this needed to be included. it was completely irrelevant to the story.i was going to give this book 1 star whether i got to the end or not anyways, because i hated it so much. it was problematic from the start. i understand wanting to portray charaters as awful people but there’s ways to do that without using slurs. just saying.idk who i was fooling when i decided to start reading this book?? i just wanted to branch out and read a classic but i got this horrendous book. idk why it has so many high ratings. people can like whatever they like but this just isn’t it for me. not the type of thing i like to read for fun tbh. and despite what i’ve said i’m not judging anybody for liking the book because it’s not my business and i’m not responsible for other people.i just wanna know how a book all about crazy people come out so dry? that’s some talent right there. a whole lot of nothing going on in the story. the book was incredibly pretentious. this woman just wants to show us how she knows latin and can throw in some french and greek in there too. the number of times i rolled my eyes with the unnecessary latin terms and phrases is unbelievable.i didn’t realize the reason everyone loves henry winter is because he’s the only one in this book with a personality. he is the psychopath they all follow around like puppies. it’s laughable. richard has to be one of the worst main characters ever written. why was this book in his pov? he was so irrelevant to the story too. he’s just a follower and a loser. he has no brain. head empty. all i really remember of him is how hot he thought the girl twin was. oh and the girl twin has no personality either, neither does boy twin. they were just there to take up space. bunny was there to be a character we’re supposed to hate and be glad he—spoiler alert—gets murdered by the group. francis is the gay one in the group who i don’t remember anything else about, probably because there is nothing else to know about him.in conclusion, this book was so long, dull, boring, pretentious, racist, and homophobic. i’m out."

“I suppose at one time in my life I might have had any number of stories, but now there is no other. This is the only story I will ever be able to tell.”

The Secret History genuinely altered my brain chemistry forever. this book is truly a masterpiece in every sense of the word, and i really regret not reading it sooner. the story left me impressed and speechless — it’s so enthralling, captivating, unique and well-written. i gotta admit that the pacing was a bit slow at times, but it didn’t bother me that much. overall, i was hooked from beginning to end.what i liked more was how all of the characters were complex, flawed and imperfect. each one of them made a lot of mistakes and for that reason they got on my nerves countless times — but nevertheless, i absolutely loved the way they were written because it just made them feel more real and human.all in all, it’s one of the best books i’ve read in a while and i highly recommend it to anyone who’s looking for a fascinating read. i had such high expectations after seeing all the hype and i’m glad it didn’t disappoint me, not even in the slightest. it was everything I was expecting and more. if i could give it more than five stars, i would without a doubt! a new favorite of mine for sure. <3 maybe someday i’ll write a longer and more detailed review for this incredible book. but since i finished reading it a few hours ago, my thoughts are still a mess so that’s all i can manage to say at the moment. sorry for this bland review.— some of my favorite quotes ♡

“Even more terrible, as we grow older, to learn that no person, no matter how beloved, can ever truly understand us.”“Forgive me, for all the things I did but mostly for the ones that I did not.”“Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it.”“Our own selves make us most unhappy, and that’s why we’re so anxious to lose them, don’t you think?”“I believe that it is better to know one book intimately that a hundred superficially.”“In short: I felt my existence was tainted, in some subtle but essential way.”“Love doesn’t conquer everything. And whoever thinks it does is a fool.”“I am nothing in my soul if not obsessive.”“It is a terrible thing to learn as a child that one is a being separate from the world, that no one and no thing hurts along with one’s burned tongues and skinned knees, that one’s aches and pains are all one’s own.”“We think we have many desires, but in fact we have only one. What is it?”“To live.”“Are you happy here?”He considered this for moment. “Not particularly,” he said. “But you’re not very happy where you are, either.”

But Beauty—unless she is wed to something more meaningful—is always superficial.” this is EXACTLY how i feel. the writing is undeniably gorgeous, the aesthetic is perfect, but it’s just that—aesthetic. richard is an unreliable narrator, sure, but not because he’s morally-grey or any other particularly interesting reason. he’s just sort of an idiot. i usually enjoy the bystander-as-narrator trope, but this was a whole new level of obliviousness. he spends pages rambling pretentiously about the most trivial things while the other characters plot very obviously in front of him and he sees absolutely Nothing.speaking of the other characters: one-dimensional and static. all of them. i prefer flawed, morally-grey characters because they’re interesting. henry, charles, and francis are not interesting. they’re just bad people doing bad things, most often to each other. they’re essentially carbon copies of each other, archetypes with no true personality aside from one or two defining traits. bunny is unbearable, and julian is comically under-utilized. he’s supposed to be this overarching influence on the characters, but he doesn’t!! do!! anything!! don’t even get me started on camilla. she’s used as a plot device for henry’s motivation and charles’ downfall and richard’s under-developed fixation. she has no personality aside from being androgynously beautiful and ~not like other girls. yes, the characters are supposed to be unlikable. i am aware of that. we’re supposed to see the events after bunny’s death as richard unveiling the truth, finally seeing past his initial intoxication with this charming, strange group of people into their cold, dead insides. but there was never truly any veil. everything is blatantly clear from the start, and i knew exactly where everything was going to go. this is not a particularly complex book, though people tend to herald it as such. the plot, character motivations, and structure are extremely straight forward.i don’t even buy the argument that the final 300 (300!!) pages are to showcase the remaining characters’ descent into guilt/madness as a consequence of their actions. none of them actually change. it’s stated very clearly that charles has always been an abusive shithole, francis has always been a nervous wreck, camilla has always been a little withdrawn, henry has always been... the way he is. there’s no “descent.” it’s simply a plateau that richard feels the need to narrate in the most mind-numbingly dull way possible.i understand everything this book was trying to do, i just don’t think it accomplished any of them."
45,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/219514-jamie,Rating 4 out of 5,"Okay, this book. This book was a lot of fun, partially, I think, because it was written in this fashion which made determining whether this was past, present or future virtually impossible. It was very romantically written and I tend to go for that sort of thing: simple meals of tomato soup and skim milk, five college-aged students who drink tea as well as burbon, scotch and on occasion whiskey--but not with anything as muddled and middle-class as coke mixed in--no, they drink it on ice, in thick lead-glass tumblers while spending weekends in a shabby (as only the very wealthy can have) weekend ""cottage"" which is actually a massive Victorian on the New England coast with a grounds keeper.The boys are called ""eccentric"" but eccentric doesn't quite cut it. They are like no boys I've ever met: dressing souly in dark suits and silken cravats, while the lone female is called Camilla, smokes, speaks with a gravely femme-fatale voice and wears over-sized cashmere sweaters and is compared, looks-wise, to Helen of Troy.This being said, perhaps it's not the most believable of novels, pray tell, however, it is EXACTLY what I LOVE in novels. Granted, there's a murder and some ghastly stuff, but I would much prefer life if it were like this: if No Fear T-shirts had never been invented, if teenagers said ""I suppose"" and didn't own televisions. If I really had met a girl in college who kept dusty tea-cups and water glasses filled with dandilions on her bedside table.It was a beautiful book with great character development. It got a little to ""masterpiece theater"" on me at the end and while one twist would have been enough, there was instead a teather of strings going every-which way...but man what a lovely way to get a little bored...It was so well written, so crisp and precise, so pretty and...novel-like. I haven't been so inspired by setting since Edith Wharton. Really.This would have been, sans the creepy, the way I HOPED my liberal arts experience would be, instead of over-weight girls with fake tans and highlights, birth-control contrived boobs and Ann Taylor, Banana Republic wanna-be classy with dimpled upper arms.

Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestWhen it comes to books, I'm like Anakin Skywalker in Attack of the Clones. I was raised and schooled to read literary books, but then I met Padme Amidala in the form of romance novels and turned my back on everything that I was taught was good. The difference between us is, Anakin lost his arm but I lost my credibility with snobs who use my love of the dark side to try and invalidate my opinion on anything they consider to have merit.THE SECRET HISTORY is the quintessential snob book, in my opinion. It's a bloated mess of self-importance, and reading it is like being water-boarded by a thesaurus. It features a cast of snobby, pretentious characters, and our hero, Richard, wants to be just like them. It's kind of like Mean Girls meets Heathers, in a way, if the characters were like, ""On Wednesdays we translate Greek mythology"" and had Bacchanalian orgies instead of suicide pacts. I'm sure all the lit snobs just died a little inside at that comparison, but hey, if the gladiator sandal fits.While the pastoral college initially seems idealistic, utopian even, all that changes when Richard meets Henry, Charles, Camila, Francis, and Bunny, and a chance encounter to prove his worth ends up catching the interest of their mentor, the reclusive and elitist Classics teacher, Julian, and bringing him into their exclusive fold. At first, he's the odd one out, looking in wistfully at these cool kids who seem like a fashion spread for Miu Miu, jealous of the secrets they're keeping from him, and all the times they spend hanging out without him. But then a murder happens, and then another murder happens, and he realizes soon that ignorance is bliss.As far as lit-fic goes, this is pretty trashy, which is maybe why I liked it so much. 500+ pages of rich white assholes doing each other dirty? Nothing gets my trashy heart a-fluttering like some quality drama. I liked her other book, THE GOLDFINCH, a bit better, because I feel like the stakes felt a little higher in that book, and it was more reminiscent of actual classic literature, a modern GREAT EXPECTATIONS or DAVID COPPERFIELD, if you will. THE SECRET HISTORY was trying to be a Greek tragedy, I think, but it didn't really work all that well, except to thumb its nose at hubris and remind you that murdering your friends and family members often brings a visit from the Furies.If you're reading this because it's a ""mystery"" you're going to be disappointed, because this is the slowest damn mystery I've ever read. Sherlock Holmes encased in carbonite would be faster. Given the dense way it's written and the important expositional dialogue that happens on each page, skimming this book is next to impossible, too. It's slow going. I'd say this is more of a character study than an actual mystery, although there is mystery and murder, as well as numerous other things that are apt to get your maiden aunts in a tizzy, like incest, drug use, suicide, and self-harm.THE SECRET HISTORY caused a big trend of literary trash involving kids doing each other dirty, which I appreciate because that is one of my favorite tropes and I felt obligated to return to the book that started it all off so I could pay proper homage to it. I did like it, and thought the writing was lovely (albeit slightly torturous), but it went on for about 100 pages more than it should have in my opinion, and the ending - like the Greek tragedies - is rather demoralizing.

I've owned this copy for a fair few years and organising a book club for it was a good push to read it (I'm afraid it would have been on my shelves for many more years to come otherwise). It was a quicker read than I expected and both fulfilled lots of the ideas I had about it (in the best way), but also surprised me in quite a few places. It was equally more gory than I thought it would be, and at the same time almost not gory enough! It immediately sucks you into the story and makes you feel like you're walking right there with the characters, following their lectures and witnessing them in their lowest moments. I was a bit disappointed by how little personality the only main female character had in this, but otherwise would highly recommend, especially in the autumn."

A classical story becomes twisted in modern times
How much do I love and admire Donna Tartt? (This is a rhetorical question; I love and admire her very, very, very much.)I read this compulsively, single-mindedly, with the pure joy of reading sparked by the same excitement I remember having when reading The Goldfinch. She may have focussed on dark subject matter, she may have penned a story filled to the brim with selfish, unimpressed, spoiled brats, but GD can she WRITE. She's just so good. She tells a story in a way that makes me irked at any obstacle that keeps me from the next paragraph. Even if that obstacle is the need to work, socialize, eat and/or sleep. Even if that obstacle is my children (I said it).Death is the mother of beauty. And what is beauty? Terror. The Secret History is a story told by Richard, a character that reminded me a little of Nick Carraway of The Great Gatsby - the observer, the outsider who belongs-but-doesn't, who is complicit-but-not. Moved away from his unhappy life in California, he finds his true home among five insufferable classics students in an exclusive Greek program. These students are Henry, Francis, Bunny, and the twins, Charles and Camilla. --Can I just stop here to say, how brilliant is it that Tartt named them Charles and Camilla?? I mean, really. And not once, in all the many pages, did anyone make reference to the royal couple. This one is far more interesting, anyway.-- We learn in the first chapter that one of the group, the obnoxious mooch Bunny, is murdered by his friends. The rest of the book is the unfolding of how this came about. The story is captivating, filled with mystery and tension. Though the book has a thoroughly modern feel, the ghosts of Dionysus and Bacchus, and other elements of Greek mythology and tragedy taint each page. It ain't pretty.One likes to think there's something in it, that old platitude amor vincit omnia. But if I've learned one thing in my short sad life, it is that that particular platitude is a lie. Love doesn't conquer everything. And whoever thinks it does is a fool.The main criticism I've read of this book is that the characters are not likeable. This is true - no one here is sweet and cuddly. There's no refuge to be found, no soft place to land. But this didn't detract in any way from my enjoyment. The characters may not be people I would choose to go on a hike in the woods with, for example, but they are fascinating. Bunny, with his wheedling, nasally voice, was particularly interesting to me, yet he was one of the most repulsive. These characters drive this compelling and magnificent debut. Forgive me, for all the things I did but mostly for the ones that I did not."

I wanted to DNF this book within 200 pages but I was curious to know what the hype was all about. The narrator, Richard Papen joins a group of five elite, mysterious, obsessed with ancient Greek literature students and shit starts to go down. The book is about young, self absorbed, vain and abusive bunch of rich kids who go to the extent of killing one of their own while making it all look so easy. The characters include, a blackmailing homophobe, a nerd who is still in the closet, a generic female love interest who has a twin, a guy who falls in love with her but his love is not reciprocated, and a stud who thinks he knows everything. The Secret History started with a typical college plot but quickly drifted off to a whole new level of pretentious and pointless waffle.Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it.In the pretext of Greek literature and philosophy, Donna Tartt has written a long, boring and vile book which does not offer us any insight to why they are drawn to such extremes. This is a story that could have been told in about 300 pages but instead went on rattling for 600-painful-shoot-me-in-the-head-for-trying-to-finish-this-pages. Extremely weak and poorly developed characters doing all kinds of crap, drugs, stealing, Bacchanalia, drinking, incest, blackmailing and even murder. The characters lacked depth and were impossible to connect with. Tartt has written a lot about Ancient Greek which is just for show and effect, they talk so much about Plato and Homer in the first few pages but it drifts off very soon. The Secret History is overrated, incomprehensible and shallow. It is a complete waste of time. Because of all the hype, I might consider reading The Goldfinch but I do not recommend this book to anyone."

I seriously intended to do so right after I finished reading, but I never ended up doing it. This wasn't (entirely) done out of laziness, but more so because I just didn't know what to say. And I still don't really know. I'm just so...unsure of what I thought of this book?Well, actually I'm not really. I didn't enjoy it massively. Mostly, it left me cold. And that's what confuses me. Because I expected to totally love this book. The synopsis sounds exactly like something I would absolutely love. And I've heard so many people absolutely raving about the story, seriously being somewhat obsessed and in love with the characters! And I came out of it feeling like I missed something...Don't get me wrong: This wasn't a bad story. The plot was certainly intriguing and left me constantly wondering what would happen next and how everything would end. I also definitely liked the characters and found them interesting, but I wanted more. I just never really connected with the them or the plot. At times, I was confused why some things happened. I just couldn't fathom how and why the characters behaved the way they did. I kept thinking (and hoping) everything would explain itself to me at the end, all the puzzle pieces would fall into place, I would have an epiphany and would suddenly go:""OH! NOW I get why everybody loves this book!"" But that moment (unfortunately) never came.And then the whole incest thing came to light...I just didn't think that was necessary, like AT ALL. I know there were undertones since the very start, so it didn't come out of nowhere, but still...it made me kind of lose respect and the (tiny bit of) love I had for the characters involved. And I'm not someone who hates incest in books just out of principle. There are certain situations were I can accept and respect such a plot point. But here it just seemed somewhat misplaced, funnily enough because there were so many scandalous things already happening. This was just too much, like Tartt tried too hard to add as many scandalous things into one book as possible.I enjoyed Tartt's writing, she certainly has a way with words. Her writing style isn't plain and average, instead it's distinguishable from others and she has a clear voice of her own. This is what saved the book for me a bit, and it's what makes me interested in trying out her other works at some point.Again: This wasn't a bad book, there was just something missing for me personally. Maybe I simply had too high or the wrong expectations. However, I can still see how others might get more out of this book than me, so I wouldn't necessarily discourage anyone from reading it."

When one of the students winds up dead, can the rest cope or destroy themselves?Yeah, it sounds like the crime books I usually read but it's a whole lot deeper than that. This is one of those Big Important Books, full of things like themes and literary references. Like Jim Thompson getting the sauce under control and writing about college kids.While Donna Tartt tarts it up a bit, the plot is straight out of the noir playbook. Rich kids get in trouble, cover up a murder, commit another murder to cover up that one, and continue down the path of self-destruction. Fortunately, Donna Tartt can write the shit out of things and the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts.The characters and the writing set it apart from many similar books. The characters were a well-realized bunch of overly-privileged college brats and their disintegration was very well done. Tartt's writing was several notches beyond what I expected.That being said, I did not love this book hard enough to crush it to death against my manly chest. While the writing was good, it took forever for things to actually happen. I thought it was well done but I'm not precisely sure I actually liked it. Another thing about it that didn't set my world on fire is that I've recently read The Likeness and felt it was a little too soon to read about such a similar group of asshole college kids.All things considered, I guess I was enraptured enough to give this a four.

But, every now and then one comes along that makes such an enormous impression, I know I'll have to read it again. This is one of my favorite novels. I haven't read it in many years. I lent out the first copy I had and never saw it again, the same with the second copy. This copy wasn't a first edition and I'm thinking there were a few edits. It's pretty much the way I remembered it though. Very thought provoking. I find myself thinking about these sad, twisted characters from time to time. Some I liked, some not. Some paid for their crimes, others seemed to move on without a great deal of difficulty. If you haven't read this book, I highly recommend it. Mystery, Greek tragedy, Literature all in one book. A+"
62,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,Rating 3 out of 5,"I remember that I liked it when I read it. But I don't recall that much of the book, and in general my system is that the less I remember, the more I mark it down. Of course, that could say more about me than about the book.I do recall being just a little skeptical about how good the author's knowledge of classics was. It's not like I know anything about the subject - I did a couple of years of Latin at school, which I hated, and I only just passed my exams. But there were a couple of funny moments. Like, I remember a bit where the word ""Argentine"" came up, and the narrator says that the ""Argent"" piece sounds golden to her.Um... ""argent"" derives from Latin argentum, which (I just looked it up) derives from the Greek 'Αργυρος, translated as silver or white metal. Even I knew the Latin derivation. So the atmosphere didn't feel quite authentic.____________________________________I have been feeling a little guilty about nickpicking this book, which, I readily agree, is sometimes quite beautiful and moving. But here's my attempt at a justification. If you're going to write about some form of obsession, it really helps to have experienced that obsession yourself. Most people have been in love at some time, so descriptions of being in love often ring true. At the other end of the spectrum, very few authors are serial killers, and your average fictional serial killer tends to come across as rather silly.In the middle, you have unusual forms of obsession, which can make good books. But the ones I like most are definitely written by people who've known them first-hand. Nabokov was crazy about chess, and Luzhin's Defense is, at least in my opinion, the only good novel ever written about chess obsession. David Foster Wallace was extremely serious about junior tennis, which is one of the things that make the E.T.A. part of Infinite Jest so compelling. And I find it hard to believe that someone who wasn't himself a literary theorist could have written Small World.If you're obsessed with something, you immerse yourself in it to such a degree that even tiny details become terribly important. That's why it felt so odd when Donna Tartt got a few things wrong in this book, which is supposed to be about people who are obsessed with classical culture. It shattered the illusion for me, and I was annoyed with her for doing that. But if you aren't as obsessive as I am, there's maybe no reason why it should worry you."

Unfortunately, the second half's hook is that things are exactly what they seem: these kids believe every action oozes the portent of Oedipus at the Oracle when, in fact, the world is humming along without paying them the least mind. While that may be the point, these kids effect this classicism gone haywire by drinking and screaming about how scared they are after knocking on each other's doors in the middle of the night. Round about the fifteenth ""there was a knock at the door. it was XXX"" I was ready to knock on the door of my septic tank, but decided to keep going to see about a climax...which never really comes. A supposedly grotesque sexual relationship is handled dismissively and without consequences, themes of flight from self are never really fulfilled (despite the fact that losing oneself is the goal of every adolsecent), and eventually you realize that you want to escape these characters as much as they want to escape themselves. Unfortunately, neither of you can. In addition to being completely unlikeable and filled with incomprehensible motivations, there is simply no way these characters would be friends with each other, no way a dim dyslexic kleptomaniac extorionist jock would be accepted into an advanced classics program, and if you can tell the difference between Francis and Charles, other than one is gay and the other isn't, do let me know."

“I suppose at one time in my life I might have had any number of stories, but now there is no other. This is the only story I will ever be able to tell.” 
I'm still in limbo after finishing this book. Honestly, I don't know what I was expecting from The Secret History. This is one of those books were you finish the last page, put it down, and don't know what to do with yourself. 
 But walking through it all was one thing; walking away, unfortunately, has proved to be quite another, and though once I though I had left that ravin forever on an April afternoon long ago, now I'm not so sure.
This book consumed my every thought. Which says a lot, seeing as it took me a looooongggg time to finish it. Life was constantly butting in which made it really hard to cut out some time to finish this book. But even with the huge breaks I had, I still wanted to come back to it. I couldn't think about anything else but this book. I was working and thinking about this book, eating and thinking about it, trying to sleep and still thinking about it. Those are the best kind of stories, in my opinion. 
Does such a thing as 'the fatal flaw,' that showy dark crack running down the middle of a life, exist outside literature? I used to think it didn't. Now I think it does. And I think that mine is this: a morbid longing for the picturesque at all costs.
So, what the hell is this about? For those who want to go in completely blind, I've tagged the description (this can all be found in the synopsis) Just to summarize: Richard moves from California to Vermont to attend Hampden College. Here he meets a group of misfit classic lovers and decides to join their ranks. This group is keeping a few secrets, though, one being a murder they committed during a Bacchian rite . It really isn't about what happens, but how it happens. If that makes any sense. And what I described isn't all that goes on. 
At all.
 There is so much more to this book. I knew the gist of the book going in from seeing countless reviews and having friends talk about it, but seeing how everything unravels is what made the book so interesting. Everything builds on itself. The plot, characters . . . it all continues to develop and progress to make a really realistic story despite some supernatural-ish elements. It is long, though. And although I wouldn't say it's slow, Donna Tartt takes her time building the story. If you're used to things developing one after the other with no breaks in between then this is going to be a huge shift in pace. I can see how some would say it's boring, or the characters are flavorless, but it suited what I wanted perfectly. And, wow can Donna Tartt write. Just scroll some of the quotes and you'll definitely see what I'm talking about. 
“There is nothing wrong with the love of Beauty. But Beauty – unless she is wed to something more meaningful – is always superficial.” 
I don't even know how to describe how wonderfully this book unfolded. The 
need, desperation, paranoia
 . . . by the end I was sweating for these guys. 
“Are you happy here?"" I said at last.He considered this for a moment. ""Not particularly,"" he said. ""But you're not very happy where you are, either.” 
The characters in The Secret History were gray, which completely sucks as a description on my part. These are boys that have committed some atrocious acts. And, in a way, their suffering was completely called for. However, you begin to grow attached to them, even though you know they're far from good. Each one of them had faults that eventually led them to their path (hubris, a wonderful word a was reacquainted with while reading this book), but at the very least I was able to understand why they did the things they did. Kinda. 
“Some things are too terrible to grasp at once. Other things – naked, sputtering, indelible in their horror – are too terrible to really grasp ever at all. It is only later, in solitude, in memory that the realization dawns: when the ashes are cold; when the mourners have departed; when one looks around and finds oneself – quite to one's surprise – in an entirely different world.” 
(aaaannnddd the most vague description of the characters and that could have possibly been though up goes to . . . me!). Anyway, before I make an even bigger mess of this review, all I have left to say is, if you're up to it, definitely give this book a shot. It's worth all 559 densely packed pages. 
“In short: I felt my existence was tainted, in some subtle but essential way.”

I've never finished a book before and felt the urge to reread it right away!! It took me 5 days to finish it. When I closed the book, I was like, That's a good book, but the hype might have been overrated, and two days later, I wanted to reread it. I couldn't stop thinking about it. The secret history follows a cultlike group of students at an elite liberal arts college in Vermont, narrated by Richard, who comes from a poor background compared to the rest of the group. Slowly, Richard becomes utterly obsessed with the five students in this group and tries to join them, but did it ever work? From the prologue, we find out that one of the group got murdered by them when they were supposed to be ""his friends."" We get to see the events that led to his murder in the first part and the aftermath of the murder in the second part. This book is SO LONG because it's character-driven instead of plot driven which isn't for everyoneWhat makes me can't wait to reread this is how I felt Richard wasn't a reliable narrator after all. Richard is extremely baised because he idolises everyone around him, especially their professor.It was good but probably overwritten for what it was, and I can't lie, I blame this book for the slump I'm in now😭Preview Hi, it's me and my high expectations."

70,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9429655-luce-cry-baby,Rating 5 out of 5,"| |  blog |  tumblr | ko-fi | | (this was made by lucy and boy if it isn't spot on)The Secret History lives rent free in my head. It is a masterpiece. A thing of rare beauty. A tour de force. A literary triumph. “One likes to think there’s something in it, that old platitude amor vincit omnia. But if I’ve learned one thing in my short sad life, it is that that particular platitude is a lie. Love doesn’t conquer everything. And whoever thinks it does is a fool.” Written in an incandescent prose The Secret History is a ferociously erudite and delightfully mischievous work of staggering genius. I have read it twice now and each time it has blown me away. Reading this novel makes for an all-consuming, almost feverish, experience. It is impossible for me to precisely articulate or express what The Secret History means to me. To speak of it as a work of fiction almost pains me. But, as I have chosen to review all of the novels that I read, I will give it a shot. Bear with me (and my ramblings).  “Four boys and a girl, they were nothing so unusual at a distance. At close range, though, they were an arresting party—at least to me, who had never seen anything like them, and to whom they suggested a variety of picturesque and fictive qualities.”The Secret History begins with a murder. Richard Papen, our narrator, looks back to the events that lead him and four other students to murder Bunny, a fellow student and ‘friend’ of theirs. That Tartt’s prologue reveals the identity of the victim and perpetrators of the murder. As Richard looks back into this defining period of his life (the only ‘story’ he “will ever be able to tell”) Tartt slowly unravels the events and motivations that led five people to murder as well as the ramifications that this murder has on their lives and their relationship with each other and themselves. In Plano, California, alienated from his parents and his peers, twenty-year-old Richard yearns to leave behind the trappings of his working-class existence. One day he comes across a prospectus for a liberal arts college in Vermont and, against his parents’ wishes, goes on to enrol himself there. At Hampden College, a painfully class-conscious Richard lies. A lot. He fabricates a ‘better’ kind of past and identity for himself, hoping that people will perceive him as he wishes to be perceived. It almost seems inevitable that a romantic like him would fall under the spell of a certain ‘clique’. These five students are the only ones to be enrolled in professor Julian Morrow’s classes, who mainly teaches classical studies. Richard is intrigued by their shared air of mystery. They don’t tend to mingle with other students and seem to belong to an entirely separate world. And Richard wants in on it. When he eventually gets accepted into Julian’s classes he becomes further intoxicated by this clique.In this first section of Richard’s story, the narrative has this almost fairytale-esque quality. Julian appears to Richard as a mythical sort of creature, the kind of mentor-like figure that would not be out of place in a monomyth. Soon Tartt however subverts our expectations by revealing just how fatal Richard’s misperception of his new reality is. The rarefied world Henry, Francis, the twins, and Bunny belong to may not be as the Elysium Richard envisioned it to be. The college itself is not the 'enlightened' haven he'd thought it would be. The more time he spends with his new acquaintances the more he becomes aware of just how dangerously disconnected they are from their everyday modern world (they certainly seem to belong to another time).As the narrative progresses, we learn just how disillusioned all of these characters are by their realities. This disillusionment leads them to apotheosize bygone eras, and, in the case of Richard, idealise their surroundings.Fraying alliances, secrets, and betrayals increase the tension between the characters, heightening the drama.As we learn of the circumstances that led to Bunny’s murder our view of Henry & Co. will begin to change. Their hunger for the inaccessible and desire to transcend their reality, perhaps to access sublimity or a higher plane of existence, leads them to cross—jump over even—quite a few lines. Yet, however flawed they reveal themselves to be (let us say, they seem to have more vices than virtues), I remained transfixed by them.Their lifestyles, while certainly extravagant, are not all that desirable. Considering their poor diets, their heavy drinking and smoking, and, at least in the case of Richard, that they are sleep deprived, it is a miracle that they don’t get scurvy or worse.Tartt doesn’t glamorise their actions and Bunny’s murder takes its toll on them. Between the anxiety of being discovered and the guilt that they (some of them) experience it seems inevitable that things take a turn for the worst. The disintegration of their friendship is hard to read but I was unable to tear my eyes away.  That Richard remains on the outskirts of this group makes Henry & Co. all the more intriguing. Henry and Camilla make for extremely ambivalent figures. Because we know as much as Richard does, we often don't know what truly motivates these characters, yet, despite how ambiguous they could be, Tartt is capable of capturing those idiosyncrasies that make them who they are. We learn more about Francis, Charles, and even Bunny, because Richard spends more time with them. While Richard’s relationship with them is far from straightforward I found their interactions to be utterly engrossing. I definitely have a bias when it comes to Francis and I could probably spend hours talking about how much I love him. Really. Just thinking about him makes me emotional (i am aware that he is far from perfect but that is also why i like him so much).Richard, unreliable narrator par par excellence, is an interesting character in his own right. He reminded me ever so slightly of the narrator from Tobias Wolff’s Old School and he even seems to have a touch of the 'dreaded' Emma Bovary (longing 24/7). Tartt demonstrates extreme acuity in the way she conveys Richard’s inner turmoil, his loneliness and his desires. He, like the others, has his fair share of flaws but I found his voice utterly relatable. The boy really has very few people that care about him. His parents seem to act as if he doesn’t exist, his professors ignore or are wholly unaware that he is teetering on the very brink of mental and physical collapse (think of his hellish winter break). Another reason why I find him so compelling is that he's surprisingly supportive of those who have made him feel like an outsider (i am an extremely petty person so, kudos to him). Given the 'otherness' he feels—and is made to feel—I thought it quite fitting that after he cuts his hair he compares himself to Arthur Rimbaud (“Je est un autre” & all that jazz).The love he believes he feels for Camilla seemed very much a result of his “fatal flaw”. That she remains a mystery to him enables him to project his own vision of ‘Camilla’ onto her. Richard seems to regard her as an Estella of sorts, the kind of ethereal beauty that so frequently appears in Victorian novels. Also, is this boy in denial about his sexuality (he’s attracted to her androgynous appearance, her “boy-feet”, her “slightly masculine grace of posture”). In many ways, Camilla is the classic object of unattainable desire (or as our boy lacan would have it ""objet petit a""). As long as his love remains unrequited Richard can remain in a perpetual state of longing. Weirdly enough, he finds fulfilment in the perpetuation of his non-fulfilment.This novel is populated by morally dubious characters who frequently transgress social norms. Not everyone is happy to do so and much of the narrative is about the guilt, anguish, anxiety, and sorrow that result from these ‘bad’ choices.The dialogues are by turns sharp, funny, illuminating, and obscure. Many of the exchanges that occur within this narrative filled me with unease, apprehension. Thanks to Richard's foreshadowing we often know that someone is hiding something or that things are going to take a turn for the worst.The unflagging tension created by the ongoing drama between them kept me at the edge-of-my-seat (even during my re-read). Their chemistry is off-the-charts. From their moments of kinship to their devastating fights. Witnessing the slow dissolution of this group filled me with dread. But how real these 'characters' feel to me! Just thinking about them makes my heart ache.Tartt enriches Richard's story with plenty of literary and mythical allusions. From the narrative's underlying Apollonian/Dionysian dichotomy to those beguiling descriptions of the ancient world. The constant blurring of reality and dreams and of truth and illusion makes this novel all the more enigmatic and the kind of book that can be read time and again (i already want to re-read it).The Secret History is a sharp and achingly beautiful novel. Tartt presents her readers with an unforgettable examination of morality, self-knowledge, loneliness, and privilege. The Secret History is a propulsive psychological thriller, a piercing examination of the folly of youth, a cautionary tale against falling for Beauty, for splendid illusions. Tartt’s scintillating style, which is at once elegant and playful, is truly hypnotising. I love how detailed she is in describing Richard's states of mind as well as her vivid descriptions of his surroundings. She often hones in on seemingly small details that end up making a certain scene or moment seem all the more real. But I also loved those moments of almost surreal humor, those brief reprieve in an otherwise unrelentingly intense narrative. What makes this novel all the more intoxicating is that readers end up falling for what the narrative is warning us against. We idealise the characters and their circumstances, we are distracted by the sharp imagery and dazzling aesthetics, so much so that we end up overlooking just how prosaic and depressing certain portions of the story are (pretty sure richard snorts ""an awful lot of cocaine in the parking lot of burger king""...yeah). Anyway, as you may have guessed if you are reading this review, I fucking love this novel. Tartt spent 9 years writing it and it sure paid off.I am, and likely always be, in awe of it. SMALL ASIDE:It was my mother who first spoke to me about Donna Tart. Her rather battered paperback copy of The Secret History was a fixture on her bookshelves. She first read it in 1994 (since then she has read it many many many times) when she was about to give birth to my older brother (to quote her: “it got me through labour”) who is exactly the kind of person you imagine him to be. Case in point: he is currently reading the Bāburnāmathe, the memoirs of Ẓahīr-ud-Dīn Muhammad Bābur (naturally, i asked what she was reading while she was pregnant with me and it turns out it would have likely been a children’s book...which explains a lot).A few months before I read The Secret History for the first time I recall overhearing my mum and brother talking about it with such reverence as to suggest that what they were discussing was not ‘merely’ a work of fiction but real people and events. I was intrigued, of course, but it was only after I was suffering from an acute case of book hangover (i’d just finished the raven cycle) that my mother recommended The Secret History to me.I won’t lie, I was worried that it would go way over my head. At that time, I did not have a degree. After dropping out of my Italian high school at age 16 I had managed to complete a rather slapdash qualification in an art and design course, which was based in Swindon—a place described in this novel as being the ‘arsehole’ of the UK—and mostly consisted in us—the students—being left to our devices in order to create whatever art or non-art we wanted to create. Unlike my brother, who spent his childhood and teens reading historical tomes or learning about historical figures or ancient cultures, I never had much interest in those things. All of this is to say that I had very little knowledge of ancient history or the western literary canon, let alone anything related to philosophy. So, I was amazed by how little my lack of knowledge in these things proved to be a hindrance in my reading experience of The Secret History.1.5 degree and 5 years later I am able to understand certain passages or motifs better but to be honest I can't say that this has affected the way I feel about this novel. I also used google a lot because I don't know latin and while I may know more about Nietzsche that 20-year-old me did I still know next-to-nothing about Plato and the other Greek lads and zilch about Buddhist traditions.SECOND ASIDE:Look, I like a lot of books and films that fall into the dark academia subgenre but I have come to despise the whole 'dark academia aesthetics' trend. If you read this novel and all you get out of it is tweed jackets and libraries...you are as bad—if not worse—than Richard (let's glamorise this extremely elitist world...yay)."

I am not disowning my earlier review but I believe the only way to be fair to Donna Tartt will be to concede another star. Now begins my earlier review.__
""Some things are too terrible to grasp at once. Other things - naked, sputtering, indelible in their horror - are too terrible to really grasp ever at all.

Oh this vile bunch of snot-nosed college brats, fattened on their parents' money like ticks on blood. Oh their ennui and way of seeking solace in esoteric practices believing them to be the one-way ticket to some metaphysical dimension which will exclude us mere working class mortals with our worldly woes from entering and interfering with whatever unearthly pursuits they busy themselves with. Well guess what kids? We would like to be rid of over-confident, smug, self-important, world-weary bastards like you too. I almost wish I could go on a mad rampage during an eye-roll inducing, unbelievably ridiculous Dionysian rite and kill every single one of you as well.The Secret History is one of the best crime thrillers I have ever read. And this is perhaps because this is not a crime thriller in the conventional sense of the term but literary fiction with moral ambiguity and loss of innocence as central themes. The actual crime(s) is a minor part of the narrative and doesn't eclipse the gradual build up to it or the domino effect it triggers subtly, a devastating chain reaction which results in the collective crumbling of the fabric of 5 young lives. And it is the shadow of this crime, the anticipation of its occurrence and the crushing psychological aftermath of it that lends the narrative its true substance. A discrepancy between the occasional sting of conscience felt by the perpetrators of the crime and their previous heinously selfish justification of the act of murder is what makes this book so utterly engrossing and a veritable unputdownable. Because here we aren't dealing with the solution of a complicated police case but instead getting acquainted with a thread of events which also happen to include a murder from the narrator's point of view who is a reluctant accomplice to the crime. But then why the conflicted 3-star rating? That's because I foresaw every unimaginative turning point or cliched plot device thrown in for the sake of heightening the drama. A third of the way into the narrative, with the grand revelation (which is not very grand to be honest), the unravelling of the rest of the story becomes very guessable. This is not to mention the 'Argentum' fallacy which Manny has pointed out in his review already. Any attentive reader who has a grasp of high school level basic chemistry will realize that 'Aurum' refers to gold, 'Argentum' refers to silver. But these aren't even the major irritants. My biggest problem is with the ludicrous contrivances that are passed off in the name of a premise for the story to build itself on. There's a tinge of unreality to the idea of a super close knit fraternity of 5 snobbish students of classical Greek in a college in 80s Vermont mentored by an even more snobbish and elitist professor, the narrator conveniently finding an entry into this brotherhood sort of grouping out of the blue and becoming a passive spectator to the sequence of events which follow. And lastly the main characters are hardly believable, especially the sole female character who remains a vaguely outlined one at best. The 3 stars are for Tartt's writing which is never showy or deliberate but graceful and quite excellent. I hope The Goldfinch is more impressive and free of proof-reading errors."

74,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline,Rating 5 out of 5,"The best word I can think of to describe this book is mesmerizing. You know from the very first page that the narrator and his friends will kill someone during the course of the story - you even know who the victim is and how he dies. But that didn't stop me from reading this book as fast as I could, trying to absorb every word. A truly gifted author can create the most unappealing character possible and still draw the audience to his/her side. Donna Tartt does exactly this with her main character, Richard, who is far from a good person. He lies frequently and well, and over the course of his narration will often mention being completely drunk or doing lines of cocaine in a matter-of-fact tone, with absolutely no shame. His five friends, all Greek scholars at an elite private college, are just like him. The six main characters of this story are not good people, and that does not bother them. That's probably what makes them, and their story, so incredibly fascinating.Here's one of my favorite quotes from the book, and it sort of sums up the entire point of the story:""The Greeks were different. They had a passion for order and symmetry, much like the Romans, but they knew how foolish it was to deny the unseen world, the old gods. Emotion, darkness, barbarism...Do you remember what we were speaking of earlier, how bloody, terrible things are sometimes the most beautiful? It's a very Greek idea, and a very profound one. Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it. And what could be more terrifying and beautiful, to souls like the Greeks or our own, than to lose control completely? To throw off the chains of being for an instant, to shatter the accident of our moral selves? Euripides speaks of the Maenads: head thrown back, throat to the stars, 'more like deer than human being.' To be absolutely free! One is quite capable, of course, of working out these destructive passions in more vulgar and less efficient ways. But how glorious to release them in a single burst! To sing, to scream, to dance barefoot in the woods in the dead of night, with no more awareness of mortality than an animal! These are poweful mysteries. The bellowing of bulls. Springs of honey bubbling from the ground. If we are strong enough in our souls that we can rip away the veil and look that naked, terrible beauty right in the face; let God consume us, devour us, unstring our bones. Then spit us out reborn."" "

You Deserve Nothing
, which did manage to rule). Anyway, using the ""hair of the dog"" theory, I'm turning back to this for a re-read. Maybe once I come out the other side I'll be recalibrated and ready for normal reading life again?***Great good gracious. I am honestly a bit tongue-tied, delirious with delight and awe for Donna Tartt and her ridiculous brilliance. This, this is why I read. To have a book seize me firmly by the lapels, or the nape of the neck, or the roots of my goddamn hair, and fling me along ecstatically, plunged deep in its mysteries, hanging on its every slip of phrase and point of plot and shudderingly lush descriptive passage.Although of course I've read this before, I remembered it with nothing more than a vague fondness. I'd guess I probably read it in 2002 or 2003, and although I am a widely acknowledged literary snob now, I wonder if I was actually spoiled from reading better books then, back when my days revolved around work at a bookstore, when there were great golden stretches of time for me to languish over Gravity's Rainbow and Hopscotch and Underworld, before life sped up and filled with real jobs and too much internet-ing and the realities of credit card debt and walking the dogs and proofreading romance novels. What I mean is: How did I not recall this book as the harrowingly amazing accomplishment that it is? Honestly I don't think I even remembered that the book didn't end after Bunny died (hush up with your cries of spoilery; Bunny's death is revealed in the book's very first sentence). I didn't remember a thing about the magical trill of her gorgeous prose, about the great full depth of her characters, who feel more real to me at this moment than many of my friends. I forgot the sheer number of literary allusions she tosses off with such casual aplomb, the way she weaves in four different languages, the way her dialogue burbles, like a perfect stream. I forgot (or may not have quite noticed) how much she hates hippies, how much she loves coke, how she idolizes while pitying the idle rich and those who rigorously devote themselves to worshipping at the altar of intellect. Anyway. I do feel better now, somehow, about moving on back to rest of the universe of non-Tartt literature. It's been wonderful to spend these weeks languishing in her worlds, and to know that they're there any time I should need to slip back into them, to restore my faith in the written word and its power.

I had high expectations for this book, especially after reading ""The Goldfinch,"" which I loved. Unfortunately, ""The Secret History"" was a real letdown. I hated the characters. They were just awful. They were all incredibly pretentious and had no personality whatsoever. The plot was rather ridiculous. I found myself bored and detached throughout most of the book. I just didn't care about any of it.I feel like Donna Tartt doesn't understand what life is actually like in academia. The setting and the characters bore no resemblance to academic life. I would have liked this book a lot more if the depiction of academia were more realistic. I'm not giving up on dark academia.

I have heard & read nothing but glowing reviews for years now. and those edits all over tumblr? MASTERPIECES. let me also say, and I cannot stress this enough: I. Don’t. Understand. Why. right off the bat, I am not a literary fiction fan so take this review with a grain of salt. but every single book I have ever read (past, present, across all genres) I have been able to see why people may like it no matter how much I hated said book. this is the only book I have ever read that I haven’t a SINGLE idea why one would enjoy this book. and you must be asking: heathur how can you say this when SO many people have given this 5 stars? and my answer to this is: I AM JUST AS CONFUSED AS YOU ARE. for once in my life I am not meaning to be come off as a bitch; I really just DONT GET IT. this dilemma of trying to find the source of pleasure in this book has given me more mental stimulation than the entire book itself. I have read almost every review on this site in order to try to open myself up to different opinions. despite my searching, however, no one seems to be able to convey in a none pretentious & intangible way why they praise this so much. but let’s look at some examples, shall we?1. The writing is atmospheric, engaging, & dripping of skill.  now I am not a writer. I am not equipped to “properly” judge a critically acclaimed author. but I can say that I have never read a more bland writing style in my life, regardless of plot (well... lack there of). I can’t even characterize tartt’s writing to give examples because, like the rest of her book & characters, it has no personality. the only instances that were “atmospheric” would be when she described the vermont landscape. but that’s the setting of the book. that doesn’t deserve praise because she can describe snow; that’s bare minimum.  the book is the OPPOSITE of engaging because tartt managed to make murder, rituals, greek culture, and dark academia so boring that you ask yourself time and time again why you’re putting yourself through this torture. THERE WASNT EVEN A TON OF GREEK SHIT. they drank, drank some more, did drugs, killed someone, drank some more, and did more drugs. THEY DIDNT EVEN DO ANYTHING WHIST HIGH OFF THEIR MINDS. honestly my pot head ass’s binge nights of great british bake-off are more entertaining to watch.  if absolutely meandering to no end with no commentary, barely-there metaphors, and lack of flavor is the key to an award winning novel, charles dickens’s legacy must live on. 2. Full of characters that are so complex and bad but you root for them anyway.  10/10 I will root for the villain. I’m just that bitch. these characters real of pretentiousness but I knew that going in. these characters are also horrendous people. they believe they’re better than everyone because they study greek (which btw doesn’t make you cool in the slightest) and they are constantly homophobic & racist (which is all unchallenged by the way, loved that.) but despite that they were the absolute MOST boring characters I’ve ever had the displeasure of reading about. I couldn’t even hate them because they invoked 0 emotions in me. they have no personalities, no interests, nothing (of course besides lot, and lots of drugs). they even had a dionysian sex ritual and we didn’t even get to see that!! HOW DO YOU MAKE CULT RITUAL BORING??? the characters go through a devolution in this book but you can’t even appreciate it because you don’t have stake in the characters. 3. This is a story you won’t forget.  really? because I was forgetting about it 50 pages in. what exactly will I not forget? the time I wasted reading this? 4. This is a modern greek tragedy.  EURIPEDES I AM SO SORRY THAT UGLY BITCH SAID THAT. if you think this is in any way a greek tragedy, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GODS let me know so I can recommend you brilliant plays because clearly you’re not reading the right ones. the only thing I managed to get out of this book was valuing aesthetics over reality and letting those ideas take over. that message did not need to be told in 500+ pages. I truly could rant for days and days over how frustrated I am by how meaningless, uninspiring, and pointless this read was. I know this review is harsh. I know this is a favorite. and please, if you are willing to try and explain further the appeal of this book I am begging you to do so because like I said, I am grasping at straws here. to me, this isn’t a preference thing, this is a self worth thing.

Albeit Richard is accepted by most of his peers, he finds he cannot enroll into the classes of Classics professor Julian Morrow, who limits enrollment to a hand-picked clique of five students: charming but secretive fraternal twins Charles and Camilla Macaulay; Francis Abernathy, a young wealthy gay man whose secluded country home becomes a sanctuary for the group; Henry Winter, an intellectual prodigy with wealthy parents and a passion for the Pāli canon, Homer, and Plato; and Edmund ""Bunny"" Corcoran, a broke and bigoted jokester who takes advantage of his friends. After Richard helps the students with their homework, they give him advice on endearing himself to Julian. Eventually Richard is accepted both into Julian's classes and the friendship circle. ...تاریخ نخستین خواشعنوان: گذشته‌ی رازآمیز؛ دانا (دونا) تارت؛ مترجم مریم مفتاحی؛ تهران، نشر قطره، 1399؛ در 834ص؛ شابک 9786222018634؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 20متاریخ سری یا «گذشته ی رازآمیز» نخستین رمان «دونا تارت» نویسندهٔ «آمریکایی» اهل «می‌سی‌سی‌پی» است که در سال 1992میلادی منتشر شد، یک داستان ماجرایی و کارآگاهی است، که یکی از دانشجویان، داستانِ شش دانشجوی ممتاز مطالعات کلاسیک کالج «ورمانت» را بازگو می‌کند، این کالج در بسیاری از جهات با کالج «بنینگتون» شباهت دارد؛ «دونا تارت» در بین سال‌های 1982میلادی تا 1986میلادی دانشجوی این کالج بوده‌ اند؛ با بروز یک قتل در این گروه، این جمع دانشجویان هم در اجتماعات علمی و هم جامعه، منزوی می‌شوند؛ این داستان بیش از آن‌که به سبک داستان‌های کاراگاهی همانند «شرلوک هولمز» شباهت داشته باشد به سبک رمان‌های پلیسی نزدیک‌تر است؛ در این داستان یکی از شش دانشجو به نام «ریچارد پاپن» راوی داستان است؛ نقل از متن: (من به نهال‌هایی که گذرگاه پشت سرم را بسته بودند، نگاه کردم؛ هرچند لحظه‌های پیمودن راه بازگشت و نخستین دانه‌های برف که از لابه‌لای درختان کاج فرو می‌ریختند در خاطرم مانده است، هرچند یادم می‌آید که چطور با خشنودی درون اتومبیل چپیدیم و مانند خانواده‌ای که از تعطیلات باز می‌گردد، در جاده به حرکت درآمدیم و «هنری» با آرواره‌هایی به‌ هم‌ فشرده در جاده‌ ی پر از چاله ‌و چوله رانندگی می‌کرد، و ما عین بچه‌ها حرافی می‌کردیم، هرچند آن شبِ دراز و وحشتناک و آن شب‌ها و روزهای طویل و هولناکی که در پی آمدند به‌ خوبی در خاطرم مانده‌ اند، فقط کافی است به پشت سرم نگاهی بیندازم و انگار نه ‌انگار این همه سال گذشته است و من دوباره آن تنگ‌ دره را از لابه‌لای درختان می‌بینم، که سبز و سیاه شده است، تصویری که یک لحظه هم از مقابل چشمانم دور نخواهد شد؛ روزی روزگاری تصور می‌کردم در زندگی‌ام ماجراهای زیادی خواهم داشت، اما حالا می‌بینم این‌طور نیست و تنها داستانی که می‌توانم بازگو کنم، همین است.)؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 15/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

83,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/150479757-akio,Rating 4 out of 5,"I'd like to start by saying that the hype surrounding this book was not the reason why I chose to pick this up. The primary culprit was Ava Reid. After finishing A Study in Drowning, I fell in love with reading and want to find more titles that have a lot to do with this whole ""dark academia"" atmosphere that people rave about. I wanted to appear pretentious and as if I read intellectual books for a living. It's a bad idea. Because not doing research on books that are recommended to you might end up in shit such as this.It sounds like I dislike this book, doesn't it? Yes, I do. I despise this book in an extremely confusing way. It's a toxic relationship that's delicious but far from healthy. It has arrived to the point where it affects me personally. I was having trouble focusing on my studies, and I had never wanted to pay more attention to my professors than ever. I just wanted to get my mind off this damn book.I want to divide this review into two sections. The first one is for those who have yet to read this book. Then I may go crazy and proceed over the technical and psychological components of this novel. I'll mark that part with a spoiler sign so you can safely avoid the novel-length spoiler portion of this review.✱✱✱

""Love doesn't conquer everything. And whoever thinks it does is a fool.""

If you don't already know, I absolutely despise this book.I'm going to compare my experience from this book in a way that works: It's essentially a single traumatic experience in my life which I am going to dread in eternity for struggling with, but I'll also be eternally grateful for the way it altered me and portrayed the reality of life in my face.This section of the review contains no story spoilers; instead, I'm rambling about my personal experience with it. But before anything else, how does one convince people to read a book when they don't want to actually persuade people to do so? I have no idea. But I will try.If you relish stories with pretentious characters who think highly of themselves, descriptive prose in a classic literature extent, murder, mind-fuck rituals, and exhaustion, this is the book for you, and you should seek professional help (respectfully).This is a debatable point, but the characters were easily memorable. The main character, Richard Papen, is a student who has gradually grown closer to a group of peculiar friends. The story is told from his perspective as an outsider. As the story progresses, he slowly realizes that this group of people is not your typical collective of existence. The point I'm trying to make is how swiftly Donna Tartt developed memorable and distinguishable characters in a couple of scenes. They have ordinary English names, but I can tell who is who based on how Richard interacts with them. These characters are not at all pleasant to be around. As you read, you should expect to dislike them more and a lot more.The plot is the epitome of slow. But, as a fan of artists like Lana Del Rey, Ethel Cain, and Weyes Blood, this was never going to be an issue for me; slow-paced pieces of storytelling grew on me. The story is divided into two parts: Book 1 and Book 2, and the first was truly literary perfection. It has the suspense, anticipation, and compelling mystery I've always been looking for. It will make readers think about morality a lot.Unfortunately, much of the second half of the book felt exceedingly sluggish and redundant. I wish most of it was trimmed because there was a lot of suspense that concluded abruptly and simply. This book is too long, even for someone who enjoys reading slow-paced novels. The ending was also unsatisfying; I'm not sure what else to make of it.By the way, the blurb for this book is a complete lie. I'll go into more detail in the spoiler section of this book, which is underneath the GIF, so if you don't want spoilers, look away now.

""Beauty is harsh.""



✱✱✱SPOILERS AHEAD. I originally used spoiler formatting to hide this section of the review, but Goodreads decided to make it look unappealing by combining all of the sentences together. It's an error, so I have to make an arrangement here.I. Writing StyleThe author's writing style, like my feelings about the book as a whole, is a love-hate relationship. I can't think of a better word for the writing other than ""descriptive."" The word choices and atmosphere it creates for most scenes are nothing short of spectacular. I can easily picture the setting and character interactions. It's surprising that this hasn't been adapted into a movie yet.I can recall a sequence of events in which everyone is forced to separate due to winter break. Richard had no choice but to live in a dilapidated and dysfunctional shelter with a hole in the roof, so he struggles greatly with it; he even attempted to repair the roof. This isn't my favorite part of the book, but I can vividly imagine the winter and the illness that Richard gradually developed as a result of his harsh environment.There are drawbacks to writing in this manner, and the author has unfortunately reached the bottom of the list of side effects.Sometimes it takes forever to read a scene because it describes everything Richard sees in his immediate surroundings. I've previously stated that this story could have been cut shorter, and I stand by that because of the sixth chapter (there are only eight in this book).Chapter 6 went into great detail about Bunny's funeral. It featured every member of the Corcoran family. Starting with their personality, physical appearance, outfits, and feelings about losing Bunny. I don't give a damn, Tartt; move on. I understand that this chapter is intended to make the characters process the crime they committed and feel guilty, but comprehending everything was unnecessary because there is no reward. The point is, the writing style can be tedious and annoying at times. It made the book feel extremely lengthy without having to be.II. CharactersRichard Papen is the main character in this story, but he doesn't feel like one to me. The entire story is told from his perspective. He is an outsider, which has both advantages and disadvantages. He tries to appear more privileged than he is, and he is desperate to join the elite group of students in the ancient Greek class. He doesn't fit in, but the story progresses to Richard having to tolerate what this group does, even involving himself in a murder and morally agreeing to it. If I set aside my animosity toward these characters and look at it objectively, Richard is still not the best character. I can only use a few words to describe this character: obsessed with the picturesque. He said it himself. I believe Richard crossed that line, involving himself in businesses where he should not be and being used by Henry Winter as a result of his naivety. But it was a smooth progression that I didn't notice for a long time.Henry Winter can be considered the main antagonist, and he felt that way, but because everyone else was so annoying, I secretly rooted for him near the end. Henry prefers to live in ancient cultures rather than the modern world. He is extremely manipulative and, while charming to Richard and his friends, appears strange to those who do not know him well. Henry gradually lost empathy for his immoral actions throughout the story. He will kill anyone who refuses to move out of the way. He's a fascinating character to analyze and unquestionably one of the book's highlights. He's probably the best-written character in the cast.Edmund ""Bunny"" Corcoran was easily my least favorite character in terms of likability. Bunny acts superior and pretends to be wealthy, but in reality, he leeches off Henry and Francis to support his extravagant way of life. Bunny is preoccupied with other people's business. He enjoys attacking people's insecurities, especially after learning about his friends' ""betrayal"" of him. To top it off, he is not only hypocritical, but also misogynistic, homophobic, racist, and everything in between. I took pleasure in rooting for him to die, which is exactly what happened in the middle of the book.Charles Macauley is Camilla's twin brother. He is a heavy drinker, and it worsened after the entire group decided to murder Bunny. I appreciated his kindness to Richard at first, but he's the quintessential example of descending into intolerable territory.Camilla Macauley is the twin sister. Richard's ultimate love interest and obsession throughout the story, who he never had a chance with. She loves Henry, but she also sleeps with her twin brother. It's really disgusting. Also, she is underutilized as a character, and she had so much potential.Francis Abernathy is one of Richard's closest friends, particularly in the second half of the book. He is vulnerable to Charles' charms and has continued to assist him despite his violent behavior towards him and Camilla. I liked him as a character, but he wasn't used as much as I wanted.Julian Morrow is an ancient Greek professor at Hampden. According to the blurb, he is supposed to be charming and manipulative, selecting students he can ""control"" and forcing them to isolate themselves from the rest of the school by only attending classes with him. He was never directly involved in the crimes committed by his students, but when he learns about them, he abandons them out of fear of being involved. He is the book's most neglected character because he is barely involved in anything, even the crimes. He never influenced the students who carried out the Bacchanal ritual, which resulted in the accidental death of a farmer. He had nothing to do with Bunny's death, and he had no influence, despite what the blurb claimed. Julian could have served as an influential character to his students throughout the story. A character who gets off easy because he wasn't directly involved in the crime, as the blurb implied.III. Themes and ToneThis was suggested to me as a Dark Academia novel, and in some ways, it is. However, it is not. Granted, I've only read two Dark Academia books thus far. However, according to the genre's definition, this book only fits its aesthetics. Not on how the genre is supposed to criticize the academy.That sounds convoluted, but what I'm trying to say is that this book is about a group of people who gradually descend into evil. There are different types of evil. The morality of each character, as well as the role of fate, is constantly questioned. The book is a comprehensive character study of not only Richard, but all of the major characters. I don't recall it critiquing the academy in the way I expected; I realized while reading that the tone wasn't going in that direction.But, in any case, I find myself questioning my morality after strongly rooting for the characters to kill Bunny. When Richard described how Bunny irritated every single character by mocking their insecurities, personal issues, or even identity, I was in an introspective mindset of ""just kill him off, for fuck sake.""IV. Memorable ScenesIt would be nice to discuss exactly how I felt while reading these significant moments from the book. But I'm afraid I would incite horrific behavior because this book and its characters know how to implant flawed morality in a reader's mind. I will do my best to convey it without expressing too much enthusiasm, which could be obnoxious. I'll also try to connect these scenes.Three chapters in, and I'll be honest: I was ready to fall asleep. The writing remained consistently good, and the plot moved forward, but the suspense became tiresome because Richard, as an outsider, had no idea what was going on in this group of friends. However, this is a lead-up to Henry's revelation scene. When Richard asked why everyone was acting strangely (avoiding his gaze at times), Henry revealed the ritualistic act they had committed, which resulted in the murder of a local farmer.In the back of my mind, I knew that murder would play a role in this story. However, the surprise comes from the ritual they performed in the woods while drunk. According to Henry, they performed a Bacchanal. Despite the fact that I was familiar with the term, I had to look it up, and it turned out to be a sexual ritual. Yes. It included the twins. Imagine how alarmed I was while reading this; I had to massage my temples to keep from passing out. I held out hope, thinking that the twins must have been separated and had not done the ""thing"" together. I will admit that I'm not sure what a Bacchanal looks like in its entirety, but it's not my fault that this book took so long to paint the whole picture.My hopes were crushed when I discovered that, yes, incest is involved. It is not implied, but rather SEEN. Charles and Camilla decided to make out in front of Richard at one point, and I had to take a break from reading to calm down. What was that for, Donna?I know and understand that this book discusses various types of depravity, but is that the only evil that could have been portrayed as a full scene? Really? Because this book excels at telling rather than showing, but when it comes to showing, is incest the only option to do that? Leave.I'm hoping to lighten the mood slightly in a sick and twisted way by discussing how excited I was when everyone was plotting Bunny's murder. When Bunny learned about the ritual they performed and discovered that Henry had inadvertently murdered someone, his self-centered ass decided to take it personally and make it all about him. Every reader of this book knows what he did after finding out about this. He attacked every character at every opportunity, insulting their deepest insecurities, including Richard, who was never involved in that ritual. Bunny also screams slurs at people based on their gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, and whatever else comes to mind. I was so ready for him to die, and when they did, I wanted to see more because the scene faded into black. The rest of the events were only implied, which adds to the book's charm, but I wanted to see him regret everything he said (or at the very least beg them to let him live).Side note: I read all of this right after watching Gone Girl, so, it was not a good day for my mentality.V. ConclusionThis is one of the novels I've ever read. Yes, you read it correctly. I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to form an accurate assessment about this. It's fantastically written, but it's extremely frustrating. I feel manipulated, and I'm probably gaslighting myself. I would never casually recommend this to anyone. If I had to summarize this review with a quote, it would be:

""I wonder if I will see Henry on the other side. If I do, I am looking forward to asking him why the hell he didn't just shoot us all and get it over with.""

Ain't that the goddamn truth.

84,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken,Rating 2 out of 5,"It's not often you get halfway through a 560-pager, stop, then ask yourself, ""Is it worth going on?"" But go on I did, even if the finish did little to amend my opinion or lift my spirits.Where to begin. First, I guess, with the characters. A small group of exclusive rich sorts, spoiled and coddled all their lives, majoring in the Classics under an eccentric professor who insists that they restrict themselves to his courses and his alone. Enter a lonely boy from California who just happened to take Greek (it happens frequently in California, I guess) in high school. He wants in with these Classical gasses. There is resistance, but he finally gets in and the others come to accept him (well, for the most part).Said Left Coaster is our narrator, our Nick Cares Away, who feels honored to run with this eccentric crew of blue bloods. Most folks go to California to find themselves, but apparently he failed to, so here he winds up in Vermont, the site of our exclusive college, looking for self-worth in all the wrong places (by no means a dis of Vermont, a lovely state).Talking, talking, talking. This has got to be the gabbiest book I've read in years. These guys love to hear themselves talk. Only they don't much care for one of themselves, and this leads to the ""Secret History,"" which is really no secret, as it only serves to show how despicable they all are. Still, the dialogue is there to reinforce the notion. Just listen to what they talk about between cigarettes and booze and quotes from famous Greeks and Romans. Yep. Despicable, all right.And it's not just the talking, it's the writing. Too much writing. Maybe it's all the poetry I've read in recent years, but I find myself less and less tolerant of overwriting in novels, as if the genre is that forgiving (it is not). Where is Edward Scissorhands, Editor in Chief, when you need him?By the end not much changes. I'm still flipping pages, trying to speed read between eye rolls, feeling no sympathy for any warm-blooded (make that cold-) character on the page. Mercifully, the history comes to a close and no one lives happily ever after, least of all me.But, hey. I finished. Meaning I get an award of sorts. It's called the ""permission to read another book"" award."
85,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was one of those books that formed my everingrained inclinations toward the masterful dominions of novel writing-- I uphold the notion that it is above all other are forms. Yes, let me begin and say that I did not think this a masterpiece now, & before (c.a. 2001) I did. This was once, like, in my top ten !!! Tartt writes like any writer wanting to sell copies (masterfully)-- concisely, with a full-rounded voice and interesting historical insight along the way. There is something about reading this AFTER college, after the initial reading was done, that takes away from my more sophomoric reading of it, in which I can attest that my pupils dilated throughout.There is a dilution of facts in the novel since most of them are told to the protagonist second-hand. It is this theme I found most attractive this time around: what if it is all a figment of the narrator's imagination? (a-la ""One Flew Over a Cuckoos Nest?"") What if the college student learns ALONG the way, does not disclose his ACTUAL feelings, but like a maestro, makes them add up to something whole, like a musical piece. I remember me (also a Biology pariah then entering an English program) at that time: trying to embellish the small, & making the irrelevant relevant even. I felt this time that the plot's a wee bit thin (but NOT HOPELESS, like ""The Little Friend""). The characters might be interchangeable, and the secret history is all but hinted at and never actually fully disclosed. That's what I appreciate in this. And there is always the appreciation of having been changed by a masterwork earlier in life, when it actually sorta counted, than later. Melancholic because I am getting older*---that's indeed an accomplishment for a novel to impart, no?*which leads to less time for leisure and more time to NOT read, as is evident by my failed attempts at reading Henry James's ""The Ambassadors"" and ""The Rise of Silas Lapham."" This is why Donna Tartt seemed like the perfect catalyst to disrupt my recent reading stagnation."
86,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/144507126-emma,Rating 5 out of 5,"“Forgive me, for all the things I did but mostly for the ones that I did not.”----My jaw is on the floor. Actually, my jaw has been there for a while. A modern classic. The Secret History was the first book I’ve read from this genre. Donna Tarrt, you totally hooked me up. This was such a complex, poetic written, disturbing and captivating story about moral, guilt and contrition. I even dare to say, that this is one of the books you call life-influencing. But let me tell you what about this book made me love it so much:*this section of my review is full of spoilers*In the Secret History, we follow a young college student called Richard. Unsatisfied, annoyed and unhappy he escapes his home town and parents to go to a college in Vermont. In the Beginning, we get to see a scene of the aftermath of the murder of a student. Bunny. There is shock, but mostly a not really subsumable cold and aloof feeling in midair. It are these feelings, which accompanied me on my way throughout the whole book. Because every character seemed a bit cold and hard-bitten in my eyes. It was a strange emotional setting, always with a creepy undertone, which I liked a lot.After this abrupt and constraining prologue, we get taken back in time, to the beginning, when Richard starts going to his new college. He is obsessed with a cult-like group of 5 students. Henry, Charles and Camilla, Francis and Bunny. And he's somehow able to get into this circle, mentored by Julian Morrow (btw I thought he had a way bigger part in the murder/book, I was surprised that he was barely involved). That’s where the actual drama begins. They start getting closer, we see the problems they all struggle with and how full of ideas they are. Ideas, which are found thanks to all the greek stuff they learn, translate and write. It’s hard to explain how, but yes, they are so obsessed with this world and ideas that they (everyone but Richard and Bunny) accidentally murder a man. I know, what? And we get to know that through Richards eyes. We follow how he gets to know of the murder, how Bunny is changing and getting uncontrollable, how they all begin to change and Henry starts to make a plan. A plan, to murder their friend Bunny, who is on the edge to reveal the previous murder. That's how they, Henry but also Richard, Charles, Camilla and Francis end up planning the death of their old friend.I know, I know, CRAZY. Literally crazy. I don’t know, if it was the bulk of drugs and alcohol they consumed who made them a bit mad, or if it’s just them, but they murdered their friend. It was so captivating, to follow their strange ideas and conversations. All I was able to, was to sit by and watch them (Not to mention I was in a constant phase of shock). They were somehow so calm most of the time – again, I know the drugs played a part in that – and they were just fascinating. Also unnormal. Nobody behaves the way they did, but I guess no sane person would do what they did anyway. Even though they are all murderers, I like them in some way, except Henry and also Charles (to clarify myself here: I did not hate Charles throughout the book, but when I got to know what he did to Camilla I started to see him in a different light. one I don't like).Henry, how Richard correctly says ”[…] is a perfectionist, I mean, really-really kind of inhuman — very brilliant, very erratic and enigmatic. He’s a stiff, cold person, Machiavellian, ascetic and he’s made himself what he is by sheer strength of will. His aspiration is to be this Platonic creature of pure rationality and that’s why he’s attracted to the Classics, and particularly to the Greeks — all those high, cold ideas of beauty and perfection.” Never, not once, I could really like Henry. I kind of lay the blame for everything on him. He is just in his own, greek and a bit sick world – not my cup of tea. Richard was a good main character. Most of the time I felt LIKE I WAS him. When he was confused, I was it, too. When he was even more confused, guess what, I was even more confused, too. And when he felt guilty, irritated, betrayed or unsatisfied, I was there, right next to him and felt what he felt. Bunny was insulting, heedless and mean. But in the first few pages, where I got to know him, I liked him the most of all characters. He was funny, silly and seemed more human than the others. That’s why I can’t despise him in the end - and I think his friends felt the same way. Yes, they murdered him, but they also were his friends - especially Henry had a deep bond to him (ironically, henry is just so cold hearted wow) - and liked him. Or better they liked the older version, before everything happened. One paragraph really made me sad and caught my attention: “Sometimes when I saw him at a distance – fists in pockets, whistling, bobbing along with his springy old walk – I would have a strong pang of affection mixed with regret. I forgave him, a hundred times over, and never on the basis of anything more than this: a look, a gesture, a certain tilt of his head.” Because they still were friends, people who knew each other and talked to each other on a daily basis. Hell, they called him ""Bun"". It is hard to see this black or white, simply because that’s not possible. Except for Henry, they all shared their concern and felt guilty. Not that this makes it any better, but it shows how ""complicated"" the situation was. This story is much more complex and difficult, than I am able to describe. They schemed, built and fought with their ideas, all that with an crazy and irrational undertone. Really, I can’t tell you how captivating it was. To conclude this mess of thoughts: Don’t get me wrong, obviously they are technically not likable murderers, but they are really likable as book characters, if you know what I mean. Donna Tarrt did such a great job. It was A LONG BOOK, it maybe contains only 570 pages, but the words are tiny and close to each other. Nonetheless I devoured the Secret History and absorbed every word. “Death is the mother of beauty,” […] “And what is beauty?” […] “Terror.” That’s exactly what this book shows. How they want to get a hold of the beauty, struggle and fail. And of course it is about guilt and contrition. Beautiful written, this was one of the best books I’ve read in a while and I will think about this for a long time. That’s for sure. ---previous review: ---OKAY are we ready for a storytime? I know we are 😌where I live we have a phone box, which is full of books. You can take one and leave one. IT IS FREAKING COOL. Second hand books for free. it is heaven, I know.

90,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50950278-iulia,Rating 5 out of 5,"I read  The Secret History  back in March and, ever since, I have been thinking about it constantly. If someone were to ask me what is my favorite book, this one would first come to mind. If I were to recommend a book, it would be this book. If I could live in a book.. well, you understand where I'm getting at.First and foremost, I should mention that I am quite a patient reader. I would rather read a thousand pages of slow action, which others may call boring, than a three hundred page fast-paced story that is hurried and insubstantial. I also appreciate florid prose and the deep level of introspection granted by first person narration.That being said, this book has hit the mark for me in every aspect: writing style, character development, intrigue, plot. I could feel Donna Tartt's meticulousness and skill in every sentence. If I could choose to ""borrow"" someone's style for myself as a writer, it would hands-down be Donna Tartt. I find it hard to review books that I loved because it's so much harder to pinpoint exactly what is so great about them. I could talk about many aspects which distinguish this work as a valuable from a literary perspective; a popular opinion since this book has gotten critical acclaim. Instead, the decisive factor for my appreciation of  The Secret History  is the impact it left on me, making me feel immersed and emotionally invested from beginning to end. When I think about its events and characters, I get this almost indescribable feeling of familiarity and remembrance. I'm sure other readers can relate, for me this is the most fulfilling experience one can get from a story.This is one I regret never being able to read for the first time again. So, if any of my friends decide to read it, you have my encouragement and my envy. :)"

I picked this up on a whim--I'd been hearing a lot about THE GOLDFINCH, Tartt's third novel, and THE SECRET HISTORY was on the front table at the bookstore--and after reading the first two sentences I knew I was going to buy it.The writing is superb, and it strikes me that through that great writing (both style and structure) Tartt manages to make a plot that is in truth rather melodramatic and implausible seem completely plausible. She gets you to root for murderers to get away with it. That's good writing."

None was delivered. I'm sorry if it's a favorite of yours - which I know is the case for many - but I just don't see the point of this drag, boring and slow-torture. Like we know what's going to happen from the very first page and nothing from there-on is surprise or even a little bit interesting to keep me going."
95,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5885760-andrew-smith,Rating 4 out of 5,"I read this because I enjoyed The Goldfinch so much. This, her first book, had great reviews and consequently I think I was expecting to find more riches than I actually did. It’s a story about a group of students studying at a New England college and the events that eventually consume them all. Likes:It’s stayed with me and lots of books don’t, even some of the good ones.A certain ‘atmosphere’ is created and there is an ongoing undercurrent of tension that is sustained throughout.The writing is of a really high standard - this lady can certainly turn a phrase.The underlying story is a good one and (if you cut out all the 'noise') it's very well told. Dislikes:All of the protagonists except the eccentric Greek tutor.I don’t feel I really I got to know or understand the person through whose eyes the story is told.It’s way too long and drags horribly at times – there are extended sections where nothing happens.Actually, apart from three short sections nothing much does happen.There’s too much focus on the micro detail of the ancient Greek studies undertaken by the students (the whole book is dripping in quotes and obscure references).The book is too clever by half, in fact it feels like it's seeking to impress on the reader just how clever the author is. For all that, I’d still queue at the bookshop to get an early copy of Tartt’s next novel, based wholly on her expertise as a writer and the amazingness (ok – not a word the author would have used) of The Goldfinch."

97,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27528763-gary,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book will linger in my memory for a long time. I was nearly finished with it last night, and found myself awake thinking not only about how it will end, but about several of the scenes and how they come together in the end. The author wrote this book masterfully and I found myself completely immersed in the story and the characters.The plot moves slowly, but it has so much depth and complexity it needs to. I read this book after Tartt's The Little Friend (despite the lower reviews), and I am glad I did. This book is so well crafted I probably would've been tempted to score The Little friend lower simply because my expectations going into it would've been much higher.The author is able to effectively recreate the mood and atmosphere of a group of people that discover what it really means to kill someone, the aftermath, and the consequences of truly transforming their consciousness into a way of thinking that vanished with the classic era. The superimposition of this world view imposed on modern seekers of the ancient classic culture, and the plot twists and turns that are a direct result of this blend, are intricately woven as the story reveals itself layer by layer.The characters are realistic, believable, and never what they seem. Throughout the story the author wraps up loose ends neatly, moving from section to section in a systematic fashion. The ending of the story is complete and satisfying as was the entire book.Highly recommended for patient and thoughtful readers."

99,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/162695567-tanya,Rating 4 out of 5,"I highly recommend reading this in fall, somewhere cosy.I know all of y'all in the comments want to hear about the incest.This book is set in the 1980s, in a college, with a group of 6 tight-knit friends: Richard (our protagonist), Henry, Francis, Bunny... Charles and Camilla. Charles and Camilla are the twins. Can you see where I'm going with this?It was revealed much later in the book that they were incestuous twins, in this lengthy paragraph, with a conversation between Richard and Francis. Wtf was that????! And then it was barely ever mentioned AGAIN. Like someone said in the comments, it just sort of came outta nowhere and then downplayed loads. But, like another someone said in the comments, the incest wasn't for fun or like some weird-ass kink, it did tie into the story. I just feel like Donna Tartt could've cut that part out entirely and the story wouldn't have fared any worse.To be completely honest, the incest wasn't even the biggest reason I docked a star off this book. The writing was very mystical and compelling, dark academia at its finest, but it was sososo LENGTHY. I didn't like how Richard would literally go off on these tangents that were very abstract thoughts about life?? I think Donna Tartt was projecting a lil' but tbh I didn't really care about that, like WHY are we talking about this shirt and WHEN are you going to tell me what it all means?? The climax of the book was about 200 pages, and I did like that part, but there's still the other 300 that I felt was a lot of smoking, drinking, partying repeat. In terms of the characters, I've heard a lot about Henry, and he delivered. I saw a review that described him as part Sherlock Holmes and part Regina George and I could not agree more. Yes, he's a psychopath, but...I sort of kind of maybe fell in love when he dropped this:“But how,” said Charles, who was close to tears, “how can you possibly justify cold-blooded murder?”Henry lit a cigarette, “I prefer to think of it,” he had said, “as redistribution of matter.”I love how every character extremely complex and morally grey. Our unreliable narrator, Richard, views this friend group at first in awe, and throughout the course of the book, that changes. Every character is flawed, not the perfect people Richard first saw, how that was portrayed, how he slowly was able to see through the facade and find out how fcking diabolical his friends truly were, that was beautiful. Morally grey is honestly an understatement because these people did some terrible things. I believe it's the feral and raw flaws of these characters and the way the author makes us justify their mistakes are the things I love about this book. I wouldn't say any character in this book is truly likeable (except for Judy Poovey I loved that girl).The thing I admired the most while reading this was Donna Tartt's language. It's a clear but complex language. I find that in some books, with more modern writing, sound crude and blunt. That's why I enjoy books like The Song of Achilles so much because the writing was so evocative and pretty back then. “It's a very Greek idea, and a very profound one. Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it. And what could be more terrifying and beautiful, to souls like the Greeks or our own, than to lose control completely? To throw off the chains of being for an instant, to shatter the accident of our mortal selves? Euripides speaks of the Maenads: head thrown I back, throat to the stars, ""more like deer than human being."" To be absolutely free! One is quite capable, of course, of working out these destructive passions in more vulgar and less efficient ways. But how glorious to release them in a single burst! To sing, to scream, to dance barefoot in the woods in the dead of night, with no more awareness of mortality than an animal! These are powerful mysteries. The bellowing of bulls. Springs of honey bubbling from the ground. If we are strong enough in our souls we can rip away the veil and look that naked, terrible beauty right in the face; let God consume us, devour us, unstring our bones. Then spit us out reborn.”That's so good??? How do you write like that??? We have the same 26 letters of the alphabet???This review was all over the place lol (i might be back to edit)- Overall a good book, dark and academic; definitely buying my own copy."
100,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6753400-gabrielle,Rating 3 out of 5,"I cannot make up my mind about whether I enjoyed or despised this book. And the more I think about it, the more I think that it might be because Donna Tartt can’t seem to decide herself how she feels about the Ivy League blue bloods she wrote about: sometimes she loves them and wants to be like them and sometimes she really hates their guts. This feeling of ambivalence covered the entire book like an angry but undecided cloud; it was annoying.I also feel like the book had a hard time deciding what kind of book it even was: the set-up of secrets, murder and paranoia is all classic noir, but it’s not really dark and bloody enough to be full-on noir. The complete lack of moral barometer of the characters, and their obsession with beauty as an end in itself is a great launching pad for a fascinating character study or psychological thriller. But that’s not really the way the narrative is developed, since the story is told as a recollection of events long-passed… It could also be meant to be critical of the elitist academic culture, but Tartt doesn’t have the talent (or wit) of Edith Warton, so it just sounds like she bitterly envies the tweed-wearing, stick-shift driving pompous asses she created.Having read and loved “Brideshead Revisited”, I feel like Tartt wanted to write her own version of the story with Richard as a stand in for Charles Ryder and a murder dumped in the middle of the story. The similarities between the two characters bothered me through the entire book. Just like Charles, Richard just wants to be one of them, one of those privileged, pampered, lazily intellectual classmates he hangs out with. But while I cared about Charles immensely, Richard struck me as a little pathetic. Of course, none of the characters in this book are remotely likable, and that’s perfectly OK with me, but I enjoy characters who are unlikable with a little bit of panache, I guess.The other characters are interesting, but, except for Bunny (who I had quite enough of by page 200) they feel underdeveloped. I wanted to explore their personalities a bit more. The dynamic between the twins as well as Camilla and Henry’s relationship are only superficially grazed upon, when digging a little deeper would have been fascinating. I totally see the appeal of self-absorbed and arrogant intellectuals and how glamorous they seem: I used to want to be one myself! But having seen the ugly side of academia, now people like that just makes me roll my eyes. I also never understood what makes Julian so charismatic, how he has a hold on Henry and how he managed to have such a troubling influence on his entire class. He seemed simply aloof to me, and I can’t grasp how he inspired his students to recreate a bacchanalia. The plot device of telling you what’s going to happen in the first couple of pages was clever: it creates an anticipation. You know what’s going to happen but you want to know how, and I really enjoyed that. The descriptions were lovely and atmospheric and the explorations of the little group’s strange philosophies and ideas was quite mesmerizing - as was the slow and toxic process of their little group falling to pieces. Parts of the book are beautifully written and moving, but it always feels a bit too cold and detached to be really gripping. I can see how some people would love this, but maybe it’s because I’ve been to school with people like that and wanted them dead: I just can’t feel invested. I was curious to know how this all wrapped up, but I wasn’t on the edge of my seat.Even after a second read (which I will admit was more enjoyable than the first), I'm still not sure. So because I can’t figure it out, I am giving this a neutral 3 stars. "

It's invisible, erratic, angelic.""Where do I even start with this book? Insanity personified. Art given form. Life at its base and thought at its most complex. I think that when you can identify with a group of people so far beyond morality, that says something about not only the writing, but the complexity of character. Elite misfits, corrupted beyond the norm, and lost in the influence of a professor, lost in a reality no one but him can touch.I love that Richard explained near the end that a lot of what he wrote of Julian, his professor, was because of his ""own fatal tendency to try to make interesting people good."" I love that in the experience we follow him through, we see how true that is. Each of the characters in this story held Julian up on an undeserved pedestal. And in Julian's appreciation of greek history and ideals, he teaches abstract ideas to impressional students who want to follow in their hero's footsteps.It leads to corruption, betrayal... and true evil. As you read in the summary for this very dark, and very entertaining read.I say this book is insanity personified because there is not a single moment that I don't wonder how on earth I can like Henry. How I feel for his despair and pain even though he is the one that caused it for himself. How I can sit with all that he does, all that he is, and still wish I could give him a hug and wish all of his problems away. It's despicable, it's concerning.This felt like a darker Gatsby, Dorian Gray... but with more than one Dorian (if you know, you know). This touches on addiction, obsession, and what the darkest parts of a human brain can create and rationalize.Oddly enough, the message I'm going to take from this book is that even though education feels like your entire life - for some of us the darkest, for some of us the brightest - it's in leaving it all behind that you find yourself. Some of us are never given that opportunity, some of us want to be who we are then forever, and some of us find that we don't like what comes next. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try. I spotlighted a quote early on in my read that said the only true desire we all share is to live, and one character corrected that by saying ""to live forever."" I thought that made the rest of the text, full of drinking and focusing on being oblivious to reality, to be quite ironic. And isn't that just so interesting?What a read. What a story. What a mind to follow.Dubbed a modern classic and more than deserving of it."

It sounded like a great novel, and I hadn't heard of it before despite it being published for many years.I took the chance...It was a difficult read at first. I started it in March figuring I'd keep on trekking with this year's ""Reading Challenge"" after a good start in January and a failed continuation in February (zero read books that month!)... Somehow, it sat on my night-table throughout April with nothing read again... May passed and then I said to myself... start over, give it a chance and if by page 100 [which seems to be the turning point from other reviews] you're not convinced, then shelve it. I took the chance...And I was intrigued more and more with each chapter. I was also annoyed with the characters. I don't often hate and like a character at the same time, but to feel that way about almost every character in this book -- yikes! I question: Am I fickle or are these people just so raw and emotional that they felt that real? I mean honestly... can't we all say there are some friends we have that we absolutely adore and amusingly dislike at the same time!!! Tartt does a fantastic job at making you feel like you're in the story wanting to punch someone or slap someone. I found myself wanting them to possibly kill their intended victim (really, that doesn't sound healthy, does it?)... but I also felt some compassion for the soon-to-be murdered character as I felt like he possibly had some redemption ahead of him.In the end, I got through the book and would recommend it to those who have longevity in their reading styles. It's one of those books where it's OK to pick it up and put it down a few times interspersed with other lighter reads. You probably don't want to read this one straight through as it is very intense and complex to think about. The plot is actually quite simple, but the various character perspectives, reactions, actions and dialogues force you to really analyze what's happening and why it's happening.Part of me thinks this should be a college read requirement, but then I realize it may give a few students way too many ideas they shouldn't be having!You should take the chance..."
103,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76202320-henk,Rating 3 out of 5,"A atmospheric story on how trying to fit in can turn disastrous. A close knit group of 6 students, isolated by their classic teacher, comes under extreme stressI was stuck with them, all of them, for good.An appropriate winter read (Chapter 3’s cold is almost Victorian and viscerally described). Some elements were very funny to me (like the panic on school, where seemingly everyone is doing coke, speed, pills and massive amounts of alchohol, when a police investigation comes down in full force), while at other times I found the book rather plodding.Richard as narrator is not all too engaging in my view (with a character even saying to him: Richard you are dense, do you have brain damage) and the second half was definitely too long for my taste. Still I liked how the group dynamics developed and how step by step the group slips further and further down their rabbit hole, with every seemingly pristine and aristocratic person ending up flawed, or worse.Richard, trying to fit in (If there is one thing I am good at, it’s lying on my feet. It’s sort of a gift I have), who shifts from biology to the classics to escape his father’s basic California environment, is our narrator.Then there is Henry, brilliant and aloof.Charles and Camilla, twins. Is this a stab at the British monarchy or were Charles and Diana in 1992 still a fairytale?Francis Abernatty, gay.And Edmund “Bunny”. Terrible and homophobic.All under the tutelage of Julian, the hermit teacher of Greek.The group has away days in estates, debates on philosophy, discussion on ethics and what it really means to experience the rituals of the Ancient World.Death is the mother of beauty & Beauty is terror already at the start of The Secret History come back as ominous warnings to Richard, who is besotted with the weird group of aristocrats he starts to spend time with. The ridicule of academia and tenured professors is commented on. And also Richard his classmates are far from perfect, when he starts to hangout more with them.I thought this was hilarious and well executed by Donna Tartt, my conversations with some of my fellow MBA students and their vocations and what their families do are so similar in a way. Also the way that people try to wriggle under their financial commitments at dinners and drinks is recognisable.Bunny shows clear homophobia, while Henry is forced to bail out our main character who is still forced to keep up appearances meanwhile:Have you been in Jamaica? No, not recently.Dying of these conversations. Or people who start their conversations with: that is my grandfather, he died on the titanic, they found his tennis racket drifting in the Nord Sea three weeks later. Another person has a castle of an aunt available for weekends in the “country”.We have people who project themselves so aloof that they say they don’t know people walked on the moon. Croquet, piquet and drinking bloody mary’s at breakfast and martinis from a thermo.Coke (not the cola) and booze are massively proliferated.How cheap are taxis, they taking the them all the time?The Great Gatsby being the favorite book of Richard makes a lot of sense.People are equally mean in the book as well:He is a masterful painter, at least conceptuallyTheir teacher (or any normal adults for that matter) hardly show up. Some of the characters are rather hard to distinguish, Henry and Francis seem rather similar in my perception and in the disclosure in chapter 5 (rather an info dump) the voice of the characters are very similar.What is unthinkable is undoable but from reading the book I quite understand why someone was murdered. I just never met such a bunch of greedy, shallow people definitely rings true, many of the characters feel like people that are just all surface.The second half of the book is a fever dream of people feeling guilty and anxious, while being under the influence of drugs. Life has gotten awfully dramatic all of the sudden is one way to put it, amplified by Godiva chocolates and amphetamines kept in bedrooms of parents. Also, new to me, but was meth already a thing in 1992?The whole crew being stoned at a funeral is subduedly funny.The trouble, basically, was that I was taking too many pills - no shit SherlockAlso unintentionally funny is Richard his obsession with “lovely kneecaps” Camilla, yet nothing happening there. In reality, our narrator even gets closer to gay sex than to her.These pay phones and people not able to reach each other gives an indication of the age of the book which for the rest is quite timeless.Having whiskey delivered in the hospital. Bribing the police. Doctors asking college kids: What did you boys have, a little cocaine, some speed maybe? - why are these Gen X’ers so wild?A lot is implied, including dark themes that made me think - Are we getting incest in the last 150 pages? - Does someone have AIDS? & Friend group is not that friendly anymore are they?Overall this was a very atmospherical read and I enjoyed it, despite the length. Often times I had the feeling that this would make such a good, moody movie, but even as a book it kept me entertained, despite some lulls in the action."

105,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67949588-mary-deacon,Rating 5 out of 5,"""The Secret History"" is the first novel by Donna Tartt.At the age of 19, Richard Papen goes to Hampden College in Vermont, to get away from his parents and his boring hometown of Plano, CA. Having done two years of study in Ancient Greek, he jumps at the opportunity to join an exclusive class of five students studying The Classics under the very selective Julian Morrow. Richard is somewhat dazzled by his fellow students: Henry Winter, dark-suited, stiff, aloof and intelligent; Francis Abernathy, angular and elegant; the beautiful twins, Charles and Camilla Macaulay, and Bunny Corcoran, loud and cheery. Never does he dream that within a few months, one of their numbers will be dead. At the center of this book, both figuratively and literally, is a murder. The narrative's split into two: what led up to the killing, and the aftermath. The story's told by Richard some nine years after he went to Vermont. Tartt advances her story at a slow and careful pace; her characters, flawed and not appealing, develop as Richard gets to know them; her descriptive prose evokes the atmosphere of the New England college. So naturally, do events lead into one another that the reader needs to step back and think: this is murder they are so discussing. Black humor relieves the tension: the twins, upbraided for their failure to plan a meal, “Well if you wake up intending to murder someone at two o’clock, you hardly think what you’re going to feed the corpse for dinner.” As well as giving the reader plenty to think about (the value of life, self-preservation, friendship any loyalty), there is a plot with a few exciting turns and a wholly unexpected climax.

My taste has changed a lot in five years and I thought I would see how this one held up. Is The Secret History pretentious, juvenile, and middlebrow? Yes. Do I like it for those very same qualities? Yes. The Secret History gives you that sweet New England campus a e s t h e t i c that no other book does. Bespoke tweed suits, classical Greek literature, precocious damaged millionaires who drink champagne out of tea pots, premeditated murder. I've worked out why I like it so much - it's simply the most pleasurable book I've ever read. A guilty indulgence."
107,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,Rating 3 out of 5,"The Secret History held my attention until its novelty wore off. Donna Tartt weaves an intriguing tale about a group of mysterious, pretentious college students who murder one of their own. We learn about this act of violence on page one, and the rest of the book describes the circumstances that occur both before and after it. Our narrator, Richard Papen, joins this exclusive clique of Classics students as a naive, longing soul - and he soon realizes that their circle hides more than lots of money and the study of Greek.Donna Tartt's prose makes the plot of The Secret History so much more and so much better than it actually is. On a basic level, the story really does just revolve around the dangerous, melodramatic misadventures of a bunch of snobby kids. However, Tartt imbues Richard's voice with cunning detail and a pavonine nostalgia. Her writing contains a penetrating, chilling quality that pulls you into her characters' lives while supplying them all with an aura of secrecy and deep, subdued emotion.However, parallel to Richard's experience with his peers, I grew tired of Tartt's writing about two-thirds into the book. Her prose got repetitive in that several passages gave off the impression that Tartt wanted them to sound impressive, but they came across as over-the-top or just unimportant in the grand scheme of things. The characters' lives lost their glamor (beyond just the dissolving of their group as an enigma) and the affective distance that once made them all compelling, ended up showcasing the shortcomings of Tartt's overall story in The Secret History. Overall, a decent read that lost its magic the more it neared its conclusion. Because of all the hype surrounding Tartt, I may still check out The Goldfinch, though I do want to read other people's opinions on The Secret History, so maybe they could educate me - and maybe fail to, as Julian did with his students - on why this book has all its hype."

I really enjoyed the atmospheric tones of this, the dread and the build up, the twists. I love that this book focused on classic students and I very much appreciated the Greek and Roman references during this reread as I have read a lot of Greek tragedy/myth, etc., since the first time I read this. I found I was able to understand the references and comparisons a lot more, and fully enjoyed this! Original Review:4.5****”The snow in the mountains was melting and Bunny had been dead several weeks before we came to understand the gravity of our situation.” Well... my university experience was wildly different from this one!!Already at the beginning of this book you know the protagonist, Richard, and his close friends have murdered someone, and so begins the story of how this group of people got to this moment is unraveled. We follow our main protagonist, Richard, as he leaves his average family home in California and sets off to a new far away college. At this elite New England college, he eventually is drawn into the small selective group that studies classics under an eccentric professor. Not only is Richard drawn to this smart Professor, he is also enamoured and obsessed by his elite peers, each intelligent with upbringings wildly different from Richard’s own and each misfits in their own way. This small selective group immerse themselves in Ancient Greek and tend not to take part in the same things that their contemporaries from other courses take part in- drawing Richard more into this elusive group. As much as their teachings and learnings are immersed in Classics- particularly Ancient Greek, so do their lives begin to mirror the tragedies they so love to debate and analyse. You see these characters degenerate and secrets unfold throughout the pages- alcoholism, mental health issues, smoking, and dysfunctional and disturbing relationships, to name a few.While this book is told from the perspective of Richard, every other character is fully developed across the page making it easy to follow who-is-who through the story.This book was tension filled, dark and bleak. The bleakness and tension really kept me trapped in this book. The elements of this book were haunting. I loved the challenges to morality that the characters face throughout the book. I really enjoy the mentions of Greek myth and the debates that took place. My downside to this book is that sometimes Latin or Ancient Greek language would be peppered in a few paragraphs which I didn’t understand. I also found some of the topics discussed were far too intellectual for my brain to handle 😂. ”Love doesn’t always conquer everything. And whoever thinks it does is a fool.”"

111,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/125873468-era,No Rating,"➢[buddy read with the equally-insane Ayla]➢[playlist] I don’t think I’ll ever see the world the same way.I have no fucking clue what to think about this book, probably because I’m currently not thinking at all. How am I supposed to process this??? My eyes have stopped reading the book but my brain just isn’t taking in the words??? What the fuck???This book changed my whole perspective. To put it simply, my brain is much more likely to go on antiquated, philosophical monologues with no prompting whatsoever and at any given time I might see something completely ordinary and immediately wonder how it would fit in with the aesthetics of Hampden College and the Ancient Greek class. The quotes from this book float through my head at any given moment and I still don’t understand half of them.“Death is the mother of beauty,” said Henry.“And what is beauty?”“Terror.”“Well said,” said Julian. “Beauty is rarely soft or consolatory. Quite the contrary. Genuine beauty is always quite alarming.”The events at the end of this book were so incongruous with the beginning, and I don’t know how to reconcile them. I’m still left wondering what the fuck happened along the way, even though I know exactly what happened along the way. The storyline developed so naturally, with this lazy poise that I didn’t know how to follow, and then all of a sudden I was at the end and I didn’t have a clue how I’d gotten there.This is one of those books with a very vague synopsis, and that’s because there’s really no other way to sum it up. Explaining the storyline of this book is virtually impossible. What am I supposed to say? A guy goes to college to escape his dull life? It follows an Ancient Greek professor and his handpicked class? It’s about morals and choices and passions? It’s about a group of college students actively denying their trauma?I still don’t know what this book is even about, but I love it. Yet another lesson I learned from these pages (and Latin class) is you don’t have to understand something to recognize it and to love it.“His students—if they were any mark of his tutelage—were imposing enough, and different as they all were they shared a certain coolness, a cruel, mannered charm which was not modern in the least but had a strange cold breath of the ancient world: they were magnificent creatures, such eyes, such hands, such looks—sic oculos, sic ille manus, sic ora ferebat. I envied them, and found them attractive; moreover this strange quality, far from being natural, gave every indication of having been intensely cultivated.”When I started this book, I was a little intimidated. I’d heard a lot of hype and praise, and I was aware that it was more than five hundred pages. It was honestly kind of daunting. When I started, the beginning was a little slow - a little boring, hard to get into. But when I kept getting through sentences I couldn’t get myself to stop.And then I was hooked. The writing of this book was so strangely addictive. It was made of long sentences and longer paragraphs, lots of rambling and descriptions that made my head spin. But it was so visionary and pretty that once I got used to the scale of everything, I was really going.Farther than that, the writing was so thought-provoking. At least three times every chapter I stopped and stared at the page and couldn’t process that I was reading something that was so true and clear and beautiful, and yet so hard to express that I’d never realized it before. I was amazed and I needed more. This is more than traditional, long-winded Gothic academia writing with extra commas thrown in. This was like the human thought process mixed with enchantments, written down.“Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it. And what could be more terrifying and beautiful, to souls like the Greeks or our own, than to lose control completely? To throw off the chains of being for an instant, to shatter the accident of our mortal selves? Euripides speaks of the Maenads: head thrown back, throat to the stars, ‘more like deer than human being.’ To be absolutely free! One is quite capable, of course, of working out these destructive passions in more vulgar and less efficient ways. But how glorious to release them in a single burst! To sing, to scream, to dance barefoot in the woods in the dead of night, with no more awareness of mortality than an animal! These are powerful mysteries. The bellowing of bulls. Springs of honey bubbling from the ground. If we are strong enough in our souls we can rip away the veil and look that naked, terrible beauty right in the face; let God consume us, devour us, unstring our bones. Then spit us out reborn.”The characters were so intriguing and compelling and I loved and then hated them all. They were so incredibly unique that it seemed like they weren’t human, but so flawed and fucked up that it was clear they couldn’t be anything else.There was this unreal quality about them all, and the way that it seemed so ordinary for them to do these classical, extravagant or wealthy things with no explanation, and it was perfectly normal for their actions to be out of time and place. The way they made some regular college-student things seem so strange, like going to parties, but smoking and drugs were inevitably classy addictions. The academia aesthetic was literally embodied by them, and they romanticized the most fucked-up things with that specific perfection. Everyone was melodramatic in the most tasteful, tasteless ways.Henry was this complex, intriguing enigma. Bunny was a brash caricature who made me question life and the way it's lived. Francis was a quiet force that I couldn’t understand but desperately wanted to. Charles was a welcoming presence hiding something that I didn’t want to grasp. Camilla was a lovely icon with so many secrets and bad habits and beautiful actions. And Julian…I was both drawn in and enchanted by him, as well as wary and cautious. What was I supposed to think about them all?""Once, over dinner, Henry was quite startled to learn from me that men had walked on the moon. “No,” he said, putting down his fork.""It’s true,” chorused the rest, who had somehow managed to pick this up along the way.“I don’t believe it.”“I saw it,” said Bunny. “It was on television.”“How did they get there? When did this happen?”Something I loved was how the main character, Richard, didn’t play into the story the way most main characters do. He wasn’t so much the protagonist as the narrator; he was a bystander in this unfolding modern tragedy and existed solely to give the readers a viewpoint into their hidden world.I also loved the way this book expressed that immersion into history, the effect that academia studies can have on a person. The book was told in such an old-timey way that it was hard to get used to, but once I did get used to it I just…fell into it? This book expressed a detachment from the world and yet this aesthetic yearning that people carry.This whole book - all 500+ pages - is the definition of hiraeth.“They too, knew this beautiful and harrowing landscape; they'd had the same experience of looking up from their books with fifth-century eyes and finding the world disconcertingly sluggish and alien, as if it were not their home.”Reading this felt like seeing a whole other realm of possibilities and limitations. I was constantly amazed at the way that it expressed these concepts that I didn’t think had words in the English language to be expressed - maybe there are a few German franken-words that can come close, but still.The narrative of The Secret History was really centered around people. Civilization and its development. Education and languages. Chance and fate. Emotions. Morals. This whole book was just about human nature and human expression.Certain common ideas become inexpressible; other, previously undreamt-of ones spring to life, finding miraculous new articulation. By necessity, I suppose, it is difficult for me to explain in English exactly what I mean. I can only say that an incendium is in its nature entirely different from the feu with which a Frenchman lights his cigarette, and both are very different from the stark, inhuman pur that the Greeks knew, the pur that roared from the towers of Ilion or leapt and screamed on that desolate, windy beach, from the funeral pyre of Patroklos.And yet somehow, I somewhat hated this book.I don’t know how to explain that that hatred doesn’t negate all the love I have been expressing in the rest of my review. This isn’t the screaming and ranting kind of hatred that I usually stuff into my reviews. This is the kind of hatred that made me constantly hesitate to pick the book up.This book made my blood boil. The characters, while they were beautiful and ethereal, were revolting and by the end I was beginning to hate them all - but still sympathize with them and root with them because how could I not? The story, while it held me by the fucking throat, made me want to scream and cry, because how did things get like this -There was nothing wrong with the quality of the book. In fact, I think it’s a mark in the book’s favor that it made me feel that strongly. Nothing in terms of the critiques of the book had changed.It’s not that my interest in the book was flagging. In fact, I was more obsessed than ever. But I kept complaining to Ayla about the things that were happening. At one point, all I did was scream into our chat. I was just so mad about it all, but I still don’t understand what I was so mad aboutIt is a terrible thing to learn as a child that one is a being separate from the world, that no one and nothing hurts along with one's burned tongues and skinned knees, that one's aches and pains are all one’s own. Even more terrible, as we grow old, to learn that no person, no matter how beloved, can ever truly understand us. Our own selves make us most unhappy, and that's why we're so anxious to lose them, don't you think?”I think this book was honestly just the consolidation of human expression. It is, at its core, just one long philosophy after another. It is morals and the questioning of morals. It is linguistics and the things that get lost in translation. It is history and mythology at once. It is anger and love and fear, recorded in hindsight that hasn't cleared up.The first half left me breathless and obsessed. I wanted to go into the book and live in the writing. It was a slow descent into what would become the madness of the second half, and I still have no idea how I’m going to live past whatever the fuck just happened.“And the nights, bigger than imagining: black and gusty and enormous, disordered and wild with stars.”I think this book will drive me insane with how perfect and yet horrible it was. As Ayla put it so perfectly, I don’t think I’ve ever read a book that’s made me feel this lost before. (her words, not mine, but I’m using them because I wholeheartedly agree)“Forgive me, for all the things I did but mostly for the ones that I did not.”Overall, The Secret History was… flawed. Perfect. Beautiful. Ugly. Tragic. Triumphant. It was disorienting, to say the least. I know I’ve rambled for almost five full pages, and I know my writing is full of incoherency (which I blame on the influence of the book and its writing style), but I don’t think I can ever fully express what I think about it. I’m just amazed at what it managed to capture. This book will leave a thorough impact on me and my mind.“We think we have many desires, but in fact we have only one. What is it?”“To live,” said Camilla.“To live forever,” said Bunny, chin cupped in palm.”"
112,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/115348811-alexandra,Rating 4 out of 5,"""Love doesn't conquer everything. And whoever thinks it does is a fool.""The Secret History by Donna Tartt is the og dark academia book so of course I had to give it a try. This is one of those books where I can understand both the people who think its the best book ever written and the people who think its boring and awful. I personally loved it, but I can see where both sides are coming from.Donna Tartt's writing is absolutely mesmerizing and I annotated and underlined so many quotes (25 notes, I think?). The pacing was really the only place where I had an issue with this book and I thought that things moved at an unbearably slow pace at points. There were certain scenes, specifically between the 25-50% mark, that were boring and completely unnecessary to the plot. Honestly, I thought that this book could have been cut 50-100 pages (it's 560 overall) and it would've been a little more engaging.Those slow parts aside, I really enjoyed the overall story and thought that it was super interesting. I'm not going to give a whole plot summary or anything, but I will talk about the characters. The book is written from the perspective of Richard, a new student in an elite society of Greek students at a liberal arts college in Vermont. I liked Richard a lot as a narrator and it felt as if he was actually telling the story and interacting with the reader. The other students were twins Camilla and Charles, Henry, Francis, and Bunny. Bunny's whole personality was even more annoying than his name somehow, but that was kind of the point. Besides him, there weren't really any characters I didn't like except for Henry in the last 50% (I won't go into any detail because I want to keep this spoiler-free). I felt kind of indifferent about Francis and Charles up until the end and Camilla was probably my favorite out of all of them. I also would like to give a huge shoutout to Judy Poovey (what a name) who absolutely SLAYED every scene she was in. Oh, and of course I can't forget my guy Brandon who had me laughing in my bedroom at 12am because my immature brain found an 8 year old's butthole jokes to be amusing for some reason.The character ""development"" was done so well and it was so intriguing to see the mental decline in each character after the murder (not a spoiler). Before starting the book, I thought that the murder was going to happen at the end, not at 50%. I really loved how Donna Tartt put this event that many people would consider to be a climax that should happen later so early on. Most of the plot actually took place AFTER the murder and there was much more of a focus on how everything spiraled out of control afterwards rather than the buildup. During the first 25%, everyone just seemed normal, if not a little nerdy. Now I firmly believe that everyone belongs in an insane asylum and that's an objective fact.The vibes were IMACULATE and I swear that I will make this Ben Barnes-esque aesthetic my life goal. It wasn't exactly a ""no plot, just vibes"" kind of book (trust me, there is a plot), but I would have loved it nonetheless if it was.The Secret History was a wonderful and depressing ""contemporary vintage"" (as my Kindle edition would say), and I would fully recommend it to anyone who loves academia and literary fiction. It taught me important life lessons on why you shouldn't kill people, how you should kill people, the effects of smoking and becoming an alcoholic, and why you shouldn't have an incestuous relationship with your twin sibling. 4 stars."

Първата ми среща с творчеството на Дона Тарт беше великолепно книжно преживяване, което надхвърли всичките ми очаквания... Романът представлява многопластова и трогателна история, чието действие не е динамично, но тъкмо заради това успява да навлезе в сърцевината на темата за престъпността сред младежите, а и е изпълнена с впечатляващи разнообразни литературни препратки! Дона пише невероятно добре, така че поднася на читателите по много елегантен начин важни за осъзнаване въпроси относно убийството, употребата на наркотици и жестокия морален упадък като цяло... Основните персонажи са ярки и сложни личности, които страшно ме развълнуваха и не бих могъл еднозначно да намразя, въпреки тяхното падение! Ричард отива в колежа в Хампдън, където да учи литература. Понеже в миналото е изучавал старогръцки, той решава отново да се запише за часове по древния език. Този негов избор го отвежда при загадъчния и елитарен преподавател Джулиан, който рядко приема нови студенти. Започвайки учебната година, Ричард бързо се сприятелява с останалите от неговата група - Хенри, Франсис, Бъни и близнаците Чарлс и Камила. Отношенията му с новите и на пръв поглед доста по-богати приятели потръгват учудващо добре. Обаче с времето разбира за някои техни мрачни тайни, които впоследствие водят до трагични събития...„Смутих се, когато станах център на вниманието им. Сякаш изведнъж образите от любима картина, вечно погълнати от собствените си занимания, бяха вперили поглед извън платното и ми бяха проговорили.“„Защото ако съвременният ум е капризен и непоследователен, класическият ум е точен, непоколебим и неумолим. Този тип способност на ума не се среща често в наши дни. И въпреки че съм в състояние да прескачам от тема на тема с най-добрите майстори на разговора, дълбоко вътре в себе си съм склонен да се вкопчвам в една тема.“„Изненадах се колко лесно успяха да ме приобщят към тяхното циклично, византийско съществуване.“„За мен тя бе истински блян: щом я зърнех, у мен се разпалваше безкрайна поредица от фантазии — от древногръцкото до готическото, от вулгарното до божественото.“„— Знаеш ли какво казва Джулиан за „Божествена комедия“?  — Не, Хенри, не знам.  — Че е неразбираема за всеки, който не е християнин. Тоест, ако някой иска да прочете и разбере Данте, той трябва да стане християнин, пък дори и за няколко часа.“„Бъни създаваше илюзия за дружелюбна и непоколебима твърдост, но всъщност имаше изключително непостоянен характер. За това имаше ред причини, но онази, която изпъкваше над всички останали, бе абсолютната му неспособност да разсъди, преди да направи нещо.“„Музиката във великата поезия се усеща дори и когато човек не знае езика. Обожавах Данте, преди да науча и една дума на италиански.“„Именно това придаваше толкова изкусителен ореол на загадъчност на всичко, което правеше или казваше. Няма никакво съмнение, че неговият личен живот бе също толкова несъвършен, колкото и на всички останали хора, но единствената страна от характера му, която ни позволяваше да видим, бе полирана до такова съвършенство, та ми се струваше, че и когато бе далеч от нас, води невъобразимо префинен живот.“„В гласа му имаше тревога, но погледът му бе странно замечтан. Знаех, че цялата тази история го бе разстроила, но бях наясно, че в хайката имаше един оперетен размах, който нямаше как да не му допадне, и че изпитваше смътно задоволство от естетиката на събитията.“„— Напротив, ядосан си.  — Не, не съм — отвърнах. Тези внезапни, панически опити да се помирим ме дразнеха повече от обидите му.“„Толкова ме болеше, докато го слушах — Хенри! — да се запъва с думите — опасявам се, че затова съзнанието ми е блокирало голяма част от тях. Подхвана съвсем типично, като се опита да се оправдае, но много бързо се препъна в безцветния отблясък на мълчанието на Джулиан.“„Когато преразказвах тези събития, се борех срещу склонността да обрисувам Джулиан прекалено сантиментално, да го накарам да изглежда прекален светец, което на практика би означавало да го подправя, само за да направя нашето благоговение пред него по-разбираемо. И да придам на образа му нещо повече освен собствената ми склонност да правя интересните хора добри.“„Мисля си за доста неща. Мисля си за първия път, когато видях бреза, за последния, когато видях Джулиан, за първото изречение, което чух и научих на гръцки. Χαλεπά τά καλά. „Красотата е жестока.“"

115,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/144985499-lancali-lancali,No Rating,"I don’t review books that much because I don’t think my opinions are all that important, but I thought I’d share my thoughts on this one because I want answers. This is not a review as much as is it a plea for someone to answer my raging questions about this novel. Spoilers below. I was hesitant to read this book at first because if I’m being honest I wasn’t a huge fan of the Goldfinch. Tartt’s writing is atmospheric, gorgeous, and showy in the best way, but it’s the content of her writing that always confuses me. The issues I have with The Secret History are the same issues I had with The Goldfinch. But let’s begging with the most glaring and rather easy issue to pick: Camilla. She is the only female character of importance and she, along with the other female characters in the book who are barely seen, are reduced to sex objects or just a fantasy-fulfilling vessel for a male character. I’m taking into account that this may just be how Richard views women as he is a bit of an unreliable narrator, but if this wasn’t intentional, it’s bothersome that a book written by a female author doesn’t pass the bechdel test. Also she is a point of realization for Charles and Francis and has no real qualities of her own. It was quite frankly one of the most frustrating encounters I’ve had with a female-created female character. Second, the first fifty pages or so started off so strong. There was lively discussion, interesting character introductions, vivid descriptions, and most of all there was a POINT. There were ideas presented that I was invested in. The next two hundred or so pages after chapter one feel needless, indulgent, and so barren compared to the rest of the book. I love idea and character-driven stories rather than plot-driven ones, but these two hundred pages contained none of the above. There were no metaphors I could scave, no scenes of interest, nothing of importance happening at all. Tartt is a deconstructionist, a method I’ve also never been a fan of but did she really need 200 pages of Richard’s internal ramblings about freezing in Hampden to set up her deconstruction of the status quo? And then after Bunny is murdered, the story is once again incredibly slow and void of anything important till the last fifty pages. There is tension building, sure, but it is done in such a cold and detached way that I did not care one bit. No ideas. No character drive. No point. Third. This book can be read as a criticism of young arrogance, pretentious narratives in academia, our endless search for a greater, enlightened state, and how easy it is to fall down the rabbit hole when it comes to violence. That is all done beautifully, however, anyone that argues the characters are meant to be unlikeable— I agree— but the thing is I don’t not like them. I don’t care about them. I didn’t care when Bunny died because I knew it was coming. Why else would Tartt make him SO unlikeable? I didn’t care about Richard, Francis, Julian, Camilla, or Charles because we never get a chance to feel anything toward them until after they’d committed the murder. I did care about Henry because I have a soft spot for the intellectually arrogant and he’s the only one who has actual human qualities. He is determined, paranoid, psychopathic, and ruthlessly intelligent. Henry just felt like the only character who was real. I agree with or like Henry, but I cared about him. Maybe this is just my personal taste, but I believe every character of importance in a novel should at least arise some sort of emotion or interest in the reader otherwise what are they but ink on a page? As a wRiTeR, or whatever I am, I do appreciate literary devices like symbolism, targeted connotation, satire, etc. That is what I can agree is well done in this book. Tartt utilized snow, flowers, buildings, mannerisms, and even dreams to say things without saying them. Also, for a book that can be considered very slow-paced, despite the fact that it was boring, I did want to keep reading, partly out of curiosity, and partly because the atmosphere is what makes the story. I’m convinced the reason most people pick up this book is because it is considered the original dark academia novel. I will say the ending was satisfying because finally there was a clear message. A point. I just wish Tartt had refined her writing more and made those plotless, slow portions of the novel actually meaningful so that this read didn’t feel so needlessly exhausting. I can understand why some people like this book, but to be honest, it was a read that, like the Goldfinch, had me constantly questioning why the author made the decisions she made. I wouldn’t recommend or not recommend it. I’m in the middle. Contemplating. Lost. Maybe that’s what Tartt intended…Henry is hot though. I’m a Henry apologist. "
116,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9539140-nataliya-yaneva,Rating 4 out of 5,"Дона Тарт похлопва по оберлихтите на душата и дори да не ви се ще, я пускате. Започва да разказва 19-годишното ѝ Аз, младо, наежено и трескаво обзето от антични видения за красота. Убийствения пъзел дорежда едно с 9 години по-зряло Аз, в което младежката жар е смекчена и е отстъпила място на дестилирани идеи. „Тайната история“ претворява доста експлоатирания в литературата мотив за престъплението и наказанието. Въпросът в писането обаче вече отдавна е не „какво“, а „как“ е написано нещо. А Дона Тарт го умее това „как“. Елегантният реверанс към Достоевски – цитатът от едноименния му роман, разсейва всякакви съмнения, че Тарт се мисли за новатор в жанра. Въпреки това тя играе по свои правила. В едно интервю казва, че е искала да разбере дали може да създаде напрежение и то да ескалира в течение на романа, ако жертвата и убиецът са ясни от самото начало. Резултатът е изпипан реквием за една мечта , в края на който всеки се озовава в своя личен ад.Протагонистът Ричард като един съвременен Разколников остава верен на името и на литературните традиции с двуликия си образ. Събитията, които описва, понякога добиват отсянка на пълна безстрастност, на някаква вивисекция на чувствата, друг път са изпълнени с мрак епизоди на пропадане, дълбоко, дълбоко. Въпреки моментите, в които Ричард се разкайва или ненавижда, или изпитва любов или благоговение, целият му разказ е някак бездушен, не особено емоционален.„– Не си способен да изпитваш силни чувства към другите, нали? Останах слисан. – За какво говориш? Разбира се, че изпитвам. – Така ли? – погледна ме учудено. – Не ми се вярва. Няма значение – каза след дълга и напрегната пауза. – Аз също.“За мен това беше роман, който изследва една неконвенционална лудост. Стремежът към красота и съвършенство са заложени в човешката природа, всичко обаче си има граници. Човешката природа най-вече. И ако преминеш тези граници, си в неизследвана територия, в ничия земя. Може би не ставаш точно звяр, но и човек съвсем не си. Персонажите на Дона Тарт осъзнаваха това.  Почти методичният им стремеж към саморазрушение беше достатъчно доказателство. При калокагатията като идеал изразът, че целта оправдава средствата, не може да бъде приложен изцяло, защото понякога средствата са в пълен противовес с целта. Така още преди достигането ѝ вече си загубил пътя към нея и се луташ нанякъде другаде. Все пак в романа идеята за саможертвеност и самоотрицание си проправят път из мъглите на алкохолните изпарения, безразборните физически контакти и егоизма. Търсенето и намирането са две различни неща. Важно е да намериш, но също и как търсиш. Защото по пътя можеш да изгубиш много повече.Имам усещането, че Дона Тарт знае какво означава да си от другата страна. От другата страна на всичко – на нормалното, на красивото, на истината. Струва ми се, че не би могло да е иначе, когато рисуваш картините си с такава педантична прецизност. Може и да греша. И все пак всяко нещо си има цена. А разколът в душата се плаща най-високо.„– Щастлив ли си тук? – казах накрая. Замисли се за миг. – Не особено. Но и ти не си много щастлив там, където си.“"

Αρχικά, βέβαια και με τρόμαξε ο όγκος του (είναι ένα τούβλο 650 σελίδων), αλλά επειδή χρόνος υπήρχε λογω διακοπών, το πήρα απόφαση. Έτσι, μπήκα στον κόσμο της donna tartt για πρώτη φορά με ό��εξη αλλά και επιφυλάξεις, καθότι είχα ακούσει πολλά σχόλια και παρατηρήσεις για την πολυλογία της. Και οντως, αυτό υπήρχε, μονο που σε εμένα λειτούργησε πολύ θετικά. Η ""πολυλογία"" αυτή με έκανε να γνωρίσω τόσο καλά και να γίνω μέρος της παρέας των 6 συμφοιτητων/πρωταγωνιστων, να δω τα μέρη που συχναζαν μέσα από τα μάτια τους, να προσπαθήσω να καταλάβω τα κίνητρα των πράξεων τους ωστε τελειωνοντας το βιβλίο ένοιωσα αυτό το κενό που μόνο ένα επιτυχημένο βιβλίο μπορει να σου δώσει μόλις το αφησεις:σαν να αφήνεις πίσω σου πρόσωπα κ καταστάσεις που θα σου λείψουν ή που λες ""δηλαδή, τι αυτό που διάβασα δε συνέβη οντως?"" Δε μπορω να το περιγράψω με άλλα λόγια, μου δημιούργησε απίστευτα συναισθήματα, με έντονες στιγμές, με χτίσιμο σασπένς και φυσικά με σημεία που όλη η εξέλιξη ""ξεφουσκωνε"", αλλά για κάποιο λόγο αισθανόμουν ότι και αυτό το χρειαζόμουν για να μπορώ να αποφορτιστω.Τέλος, θα πω ότι για το 2020 είχα αποφασίσει να κάνω ένα book challenge που είχα προαποφασισμενα ποια βιβλία να διαβάσω, όμως το άφησα στην άκρη μόνο κ μόνο για να διαβάσω στη συνέχεια τα υπόλοιπα 2  βιβλία της tartt στο καπάκι. Αυτό.Υ. Γ. 1 : όσοι και όσες λατρεψατε τον χενρυ Γουίντερ όσο εγώ, σηκώστε το χέρι και ελάτε να γίνουμε φίλοι 😀Υ. Γ. 2 :Καλή αναγνωστική χρόνια σε όλους 🙏❤️"

I adore a lot of quotes and they made me think different about some things, and I love when a book does that to me. And, the most important thing to me, I connected with the all characters and I wanted to know more and more about them.

I am nothing in my soul if not obsessive.
The story follows Richard, a transfer student in one of the most expensive colleges, who receives a scholarship and moves to Vermont.Upon his arrival, he becomes obsessed with the elite group of 5 classics students, and does everything in his power to be included in their class. He finds them the most intelligent and beautiful. 
Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it.
We know Bunny, one of the group, was murdered from page 1. The plot is about why it happened, not what happened. There are some spoilers ahead, but nothing major.Richard’s inability to recognise that he is, in fact, the main antagonist was probably the most infuriating yet genius move from the author. Repeatedly he mentions that he is not a bad person. That it was Henry who made him do all those horrible things. Even years after, he still believes he is not bad.He judges every other character’s flaws, yet fails to see his own. Even the fact that he still keeps pretending to be rich when everyone has figured him out. His thought process was disgusting sometimes, especially when it comes to the women in his life. That part when he thinks of abusing Camilla :/ Henry is sort of a leader of the group, as well as Julian’s favourite and best student. But he is also the most honest one if you ask me. He doesn’t pretend to be what he isn’t. The most interesting character in the whole book.He deserved a better ending🥲The twins, Charles and Camilla, were the first to befriend Richard and although they aren’t bad people per se… they’re not innocent either. Especially Charles🙃 I did not care for them whatsoever. Not even Camilla. She knew what she was doing. But then again, none of these characters are supposed to be 100% likeable. Francis is probably my favourite character when it comes to judgement.“Cubitum eamus?” Yes. He’s always the supportive friend, the honest friend, the one that comes to the rescue.Also, consent king. His ending was too realistic, unfortunately. But I agree with him, you can’t be expected to be what you’re not used to. Julian, just as Henry said, is a coward. He nitpicks his students to be better than everyone else, to have a royal education with him and only him. He encourages them to incorporate magical ancient rituals, knowing well how they might end. He succumbs to elitism as much as he can and makes his students fall in love with him. Yet, when they need him the most, he doesn’t care. My opinion about the bacchanal is that it worked. They had the same visions, they did everything right and even cleansed blood by blood. They saw the deity. The prove that it worked is that it was followed by a series of unfortunate events to grant their true wishes, so they all got what they actually wanted. Henry - to feel, Francis - more money, Camilla - to be free of Charles, Charles - for Henry to be out of the way.How they got it is a whole different story."

“There is nothing wrong with the love of Beauty. But Beauty - unless she is wed to something more meaningful - is always superficial.”

I don't know how to explain this in simple words, but I just don't get it. Ever since I finished We Were Liars and enjoyed it -despite the cringy dialogue here and there- I wanted to read this one because many people saw similarities between the two books with most saying this is a better version of the story. Dear reader, I disagree!This also has more than half a million ratings and an average rating of ~4.2 stars which means the majority of readers enjoyed it. And I am not someone who do hate reading because life is too short for that, so I went into this expecting to love it and wanting to love it even.Where did things go wrong?The story starts in a very interesting way with the opening line: 

“The snow in the mountains was melting and Bunny had been dead for several weeks before we came to understand the gravity of our situation”.

This is very smart in my opinion because it gives a lot of information but raises even more questions. Who is Bunny and why is he dead and who are the ""we"" the narrator is talking about?So, we know there's a murder and we quickly get to know who did it and it means we now want the motive so it's a whydunit kind of story rather than whodunit. Up till here everything is okay. The problems for me are the pacing which is very slow, the almost non-existent plot and the length of the story that I still can't understand. This is the total opposite of We Were Liars where the characters were intriguing, and it was fast and kind of short even. The characters in this story are insufferable and the whole motive for the murder is very questionable and may be unrealistic unless you believe these are a bunch of very weird people and they are. It apparently mirrors one of Greeks most beloved tragedies but I did not think it worked in the present time. It can be argued that this book is a character study and I would have loved that if those characters were anything but pretentious and melodramatic, they even gave me Sally Rooney character vibes. Let's be honest, it is admirable that this book took 7 years for the author to write but she was only 17 so I don't expect her to be an expert on the subject. 

“Forgive me, for all the things I did but mostly for the ones that I did not.”

Summary: I really wanted to fell into the hype of this book and love it but I simply couldn't. The writing is okay, the characters are just over the top and I still think something went over my head with the plot. I don't like pretentious books and this was one for sure. I initially gave it 3 stars because it still held my attention to finish it but after writing this review, I am finding out I did not enjoy it that much."
124,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58118625-frona,Rating 2 out of 5,"The beginning of this book gave me an eerie feeling; the focus wasn't where it should be and all the things that seem important were later ignored or followed by a hazy resolution. It felt as if something was misplaced and the setting called for a different examination, more suitable to the expectations it evoked. The natural flow of story was chopped by a robotic hand or some other foreign and unkind force. Over the years of reading I've learnt that this aversion I often feel towards beginnings has a simple cause; the more peculiar and unique the story is, the stronger is my initial resistance and the longer it takes for me to submerge in. Once in, the foreignness disappears and there is a colorful and plentiful world awaiting.But sometimes, like in The Secret History, the robotic hand is not a part of a secret book's organism, but forms its general flaw. The props that were used in this book served only the author's intentions and lacked any development, reason, root, or a life of their own. They were violently plucked out of any imaginable habitat and left floating around to be at the story's disposal in times of need. There was nothing magical about bored college snobs that go on killing people out of pretentiousness. The theme that preoccupied many authors before was degraded to a flavorless, shiny popsicle.Taking it as a modern version of Crime and Punishment, is not only an insult for the latter but also a very rough estimation of the former. Our values and fashions may really have changed, but human nature still has the same basic characteristic, reasons and laws that shape it. We are not floating in a void, even though the divine reason has abandoned us, waiting for literature to do whatever it wants with us. It can, of course, but that's the reason why so many bad books are being produced."

I feel this is exactly the kind of book I would love and I did. I read some of the reviews from people who didn't enjoy it and I can see why they wouldn't have. I think it really comes down to what people like in a book. I really like when something feels well written, I like complicated characters with flaws that I'm not necessarily cheering for, and I love the tension between ideals and reality and when books explore that so I really enjoyed reading this one. Also the book does say that ""Beauty is rarely soft or consolatory. Quite the contrary. Genuine beauty is always quite alarming."" and I think as a piece of art it lives up to that. Also I only realized now that the same person wrote The Goldfinch which I've been wanting to read, so maybe I'll try to get to it soon. "

127,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7317186-celeste,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Secret History is one of those books that I’ve been meaning to read forever. According to my Kindle account, I purchased a copy more than five years ago; somehow, I just never got around to reading it. It’s one of those books that sounds so perfect for me that I’m afraid to read it for fear of it failing to meet the irrationally high expectations I have for it. When my co-blogger Emma informed me that it was one of her favorite books ever, I decided to take the plunge. I’m so glad I did. Far from failing to meet my absurd expectations, The Secret History blew them out of the water and is now happily ensconced on my favorites shelf.“Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it. And what could be more terrifying and beautiful, to souls like the Greeks or our own, than to lose control completely?”This novel is one of the most atmospheric school stories I’ve read outside of the fantasy genre. Tartt was able to capture her setting so well that I could smell and taste it and see it in my core. Richard, our wallflower of a narrator, works his way to Hampden College, leaving his bland suburban life in California behind in favor of a classier, more erudite fresh beginning in New England. Upon his arrival, he becomes fascinated with the intensely exclusive class of Classics majors, five in all, and their professor. They are enigmatic and effortlessly classy and everything else Richard wishes to be; he determines that he will do anything to join that selective class, and he manages it. That decision radically changes his life.“If we are strong enough in our souls we can rip away the veil and look that naked, terrible beauty right in the face; let God consume us, devour us, unstring our bones. Then spit us out reborn.” The group dynamic reminds me of a darker Dead Poet’s Society, or a more academic Cruel Intentions. The conversations that fill the role of classes are profound and profoundly disturbing in their content, and Julian Morrow is an oddly captivating teacher. His larger than life personality compels his few students to see him as the axis around which their entire lives turn, and to feel such honor at being selected as one of his students that they can’t really see the world outside of his classroom. I was completely captivated by his philosophy, even though in reality our worldview are violently opposed.“Love doesn’t conquer everything. And whoever thinks it does is a fool.”While Julian is a hub around which the story spins, he is in no way its central character. Neither is Richard, when it comes down to it. He is an observer, first and foremost, and though he is undeniably involved in the plot, we see the other students in the group as the stars of the show through Richard’s eyes. First we have Bunny, who is larger than life and shameless in his mooching off of others in the group. We know from the first sentence of the novel that Bunny dies, and from the first page that the rest of the group murdered him. What we don’t know is why, and what events led to this radical decision. Then we have Charles and Camilla, beautiful twins who see etherial and fragile and tragic in the Gothic tradition. We also have Francis, the gay hypochondriac who is obsessed with physical appearance and incredibly high strung. Finally, we have Henry, the glue that binds the group together and the mastermind behind every decision. All five of these characters outclass Richard, coming from money or important families or both. Richard lies at every turn, doing everything in his power to slide comfortably and irrevocably into the heart of the group. And he succeeds.“Reason is always apparent to a discerning eye. But luck? It’s invisible, erratic, angelic.”Unfortunately, the group isn’t as charming up close is it is from a distance. I think the group of frenemies can be be described as mirroring the Classics that bind them: decaying beauty. All six of the students have this aloof magnetism that is utterly entrancing but, like Francis’s house in the country where they spend so much of their time, that beauty is brittle and beginning to rot. As the story progresses, we see the friends fall into various addictions and turn on each other as they inwardly decay further and further. “What is unthinkable is undoable.”What I adore most about this book is the unique setup of the plot. Rarely are readers informed from the beginning not only what the crime is, but who committed it, especially when said criminals aren’t in police custody. This would seem to remove the tension in the plot, but I found that it did the exact opposite. I was on the edge of my seat, wondering what triggered this chain of events and what the aftermath would be. I happened to be reading Crime and Punishment at the same time I read this book, and it’s wild how well the two stories pair. There was also a second, completely unpredictable climax towards the end of the book that shocked me. Tartt did a marvelous job balancing the pacing of the book. We were given so many details and ordinary elements of student life mixed with the tension and degradation that defined the group and led to both of the major climaxes of the story. “Some things are too terrible to grasp at once. Other things—naked, sputtering, indelible in their horror—are too terrible to really ever grasp at all. It is only later, in solitude, in memory, that the realization dawns: when the ashes are cold; when the mourners have departed; when one looks around and finds oneself—quite to one’s surprise—in an entirely different world.”Tartt also has an absolutely brilliant way with words. Every single word choice was intentional, and you could sense the care and craftsmanship she put into every sentence. Her prose is lovely, and I think I highlighted close to a quarter of the book. The tale she wove and the characters she crafted were unequivocally entrancing, and I caught myself thinking about them often throughout my days, even when I hadn’t read a page of it that day. Tartt did an amazing job with Richard, our narrator. Like Nick Carraway in The Great Gatsby and Charlie in The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Richard is very much present in the story, but he does his best to blend in and observe what the fabulous people who have accepted him are doing with their lives. This writing choice lets readers view the action a bit more objectively than we could if the action was told from a more central perspective. Also, as with the aforementioned narrators, we’re informed early on in the story that our narrator is not the most reliable and trustworthy of storytellers, so we constantly question what’s being reported. In my opinion, this allows for a deeper involvement in the story, as we are called on to judge the truth of the narrative for ourselves.“It does not do to be frightened of things about which you know nothing… You are like children. Afraid of the dark.”The mix of classical orgy and frat party that defined the characters’ school days was such an interesting duality. It goes to show that human nature has not changed all that much in the past few millennia. Every discussion of religion and self and philosophy and sex and worldview was absolutely fascinating, and I hung on every word. The relationships between this group of friends was one that readers can see is both special in ways that we long for and horribly unhealthy for all parties involved. I also loved the setting. I have a weakness for school stories done well, and The Secret History is among the best I’ve read. “They understood not only evil. It seemed, but the extravagance of tricks with which evil presents itself as good.”Gushing aside, I loved this book with my entire being. I truly believe that it’s a modern classic, and it’s one I plan to reread often. While I can’t speak to the rest of her work, The Secret History alone proves that Tartt is a powerhouse of an author, and I’m already itching to read more from her.You can find  this review and more at Novel Notions.

Oamenii de pretutindeni au stiut-o dintotdeauna. Si credem si azi in ele la fel de mult ca si Homer. Doar ca acum le numim altfel. Memorie. Subconstient.""""Dragostea nu invinge totul. Si oricine crede altceva e un prost.""Am citit foarte multe romane politiste si m-am obisnuit ca victimele si criminalii sa aiba o anumita tipologie, ca mintea criminalului sa fie programata pentru a comite crima perfecta, ori ca aceleasi greseli sa fie comise de ambele tabere. Ei bine, aceasta carte a reusit sa ma surprinda dupa foarte mult timp.Incarcatura psihologica este teribila si foarte ciudat, aerul de confesiune si complicitate al naratorului mi-a placut si m-a deranjat in egala masura. Parca nu doream sa stiu, nu doream sa fiu parte la aceasta crima, deoarece indragind atat de mult protagonistii nu doream sa accept ca ei sunt criminalii. Mi-am dat seama ca noua, oamenilor in general, ne este greu sa vedem acel cusur, acel pacat la oamenii pe care-i consideram foarte buni si trebuie sa recunosc ca la sfarsit mi-a parut rau si chiar mi-a fost mila pentru ei. In mod cert este un roman altfel decat te astepti si pe langa faptul ca e diferit si interesant, te tulbura foarte mult. In ceea ce priveste actiunea, il avem in prim plan pe Richard Papen, un tanar sarac care reuseste sa devina student la Colegiul Hampden si acolo sa intre intr-un grup exclusivist de studenti bogati care invata greaca antica cu un profesor aparte. Stilul lor excentric, misterul din jurul lor si faptul ca sunt aproape inabordabili si de neatins le confera aproape o aura de legenda. Atunci cand Richard descopera ca noii sai prieteni au comis o crima din greseala si ca sunt santajati de catre unul dintre ei apare prima alegere morala pe care trebuie s-o faca - sa taca, sa-i denunte sau sa-i ajute.Personajele sunt foarte interesante si as incepe cu Bunny, cel care ii tapeaza pe ceilalti de bani, un student mereu lejer si glumet, insa care are prostul obicei de a-i jigni pe ceilalti, atacandu-i la punctele slabe. Spre sfarsit ajunge sa aiba apucaturi de psihopat, vanandu-i si terorizandu-i psihic pe ceilalti si transformandu-se astfel intr-o tinta.Camilla este singura fata din grup, fiind totodata atat sensibila cat si puternica. Este caracterizata de catre Richard ca fiind: ""regina care incheia suita valetilor intunecati, a regelui sumbru si a jokerului.""Francis are o aura de lord si este mereu elegant imbracat iar Charles, fratele Camillei are ca slabiciune din pacate, bautura, ce o sa-i aduca multe necazuri.Am lasat la sfarsit cel mai interesant personaj, pe Henry, care este atat de monstruos si atat de minunat construit. Are foarte multe trasaturi bune: este de o inteligenta iesita din comun, este un bun si saritor prieten, fiind cel mai responsabil si mai matur din grup. Totusi cartea la fiecare pas are o tenta insinuanta la adresa lui, facandu-ne mereu sa ne intrebam daca avem de-a face cu un geniu bun sau rau. Eu am considerat totusi ca sacrificiul sau nu a fost unul egoist, ci din dragoste pentru Camilla si ca mereu a urmarit bunastarea prietenilor sai si nu sa-si satisfaca o pofta criminala. Profesorul, in care a crezut ca intr-un zeu, pana-n ultima secunda, ajunge sa se dezica de el, de monstruozitatea faptelor lui si asta il doare cel mai mult, pentru ca lasitatea sa l-a dezamagit profund.Cartea subliniaza in mai multe locuri ca frumusetea doare, e cruda si nemiloasa si consider ca se refera la partea intunecata a lui Henry. Chiar si un om atat de bun si perfect zugravit are acea pata intunecata, acel pacat ce a condus spre crima.Recomand cartea pentru analiza psihologica a personajelor, pentru ca este o altfel de carte politista, in care nu avem de-a face cu un detectiv si cu metodele clasice de investigatie si mai ales iubitorilor de greaca antica.Am selectat ca incheire cateva citate care mi-au ramas in minte:""Si cred ca defectul meu fatal este urmatorul: un dor morbid de ceva neaparat impresionant, indiferent de riscuri.""""... consider ca e mai bine sa stii o singura carte in mod profund decat sa stii 100 intr-o maniera superficiala.""""Frumusetea este foarte rar blanda si consolatoare. Dimpotriva, adevarata frumusete este intotdeauna destul de alarmanta.""""Frumusetea este teroare. Vrem sa fim devorati de ea, sa ne ascundem in acea flacara care ne rafineaza."""

Reading the book made me wish I'd studied Greek classics at University; the stories and philosophies of the ancient Greeks seem so fascinating. This is definitely a very intellectual, psychological read with a lot of mystery. The language is beautiful. I read somewhere that some people complained about Donna Tartt essentially showing off her knowledge and vocabulary in this book but I really don't see what the problem is; I enjoyed how she expressed herself and what's language for but as a tool to be able to express oneself in any way one wishes? The story was pretty enthralling, though I did prefer the first half to the second. The second half was mostly concentrating on the psychological, which was interesting, but there was so much drug and alcohol usage which seemed to drag on too long for my liking."

I truly do not think words are suffice to explain how much I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The writing was just so beautiful, the characters were meticulously distinguished, the story was beyond magnificent; again, just telling you these words isn’t enough. I will say, though, the writing isn’t for everyone. This is a story that is often composed of filler words, if you can call them that, and it’s really up to the reader to decide whether it adds to the plot or if it’s just boring. Regardless, I thought it was marvelous. The only bad thing in my experience of reading this book was the fact that I was not able to read it in one sitting due to school (how fun!) and instead had to read it sporadically.

this book WILL be my personality. indefinitely. a decade of writing is what it took for this book to exist. donna tartt wrote this for ten years, and the intricacy of every line is so incredibly evident. every time i opened this book, each page burst into life with a new, startlingly vivid line of morality or set of beautifully written prose. when they created the cliche of ""entering a different world"" while reading, they meant this.but how, raya, you ask, was it so entertaining and remarkably written?the secret history is a novel that begins with a wave of introductory calm—elaborate, slightly (very) pretentious, almost unsettling—but rapidly evolves into a stunning display of ingenuity, facade, shattered perception, and deceit. more importantly, however, it gives you characters so twisted by awareness of narration you’ll find yourself constantly questioning what you believe.the book is organized into book one and book two; both vastly different. although this is nowhere near a fantasy, there were fantastical elements throughout the story that i found strengthened both the air of surreality and overall disillusionment of the narrative.near the beginning, i wrote that richard had grown deeply connected to the five, so much that something would inevitably tear apart what he loved about them. the novel weaves an illusion then implements a gradual fracturing of it, cracks around the edges that seem of minimal importance until they overlap and shatter completely. somehow, i expected it—i thought, yes, it only makes sense to build something so beautifully in order to destroy it—but when it happened, i was stunned into silence. with the creation of such an illusion, such a kind, united, comforting one, comes a shock not to the mind or logic, but the emotions protected by it. the bonds we’ve linked it to. this is a result of what i believe we call… a secret history.here’s where it becomes truly remarkable: the characters. for students of moral philosophy, among other things, the main six are astoundingly morally unsound. first, we begin with henry winter. fan favorite. sociopath. morally ambiguous but also not ambiguous at all because he likely does not have a moral compass. he also wears dark suits and seems to have an umbrella with him often. tartt brought his flaws equal to his kindness, turning disillusionment into something almost beneficial for him. prior to book two, i would have defended this man in court any day.francis abernathy. this is his world and we are simply living in it. cubitum eamus? richard? maraschino cherries straight from the jar? the emergency room scene? the LETTER? need i say more? he deserves the most and he is truly superior.richard papen, our californian by birth and nature who is obsessed with the picturesque. our lovely student who was afraid to ask for a heating system in his room. our narrator, and perhaps the best and worst kind: the unreliable one. his infatuation with not only camilla, but the others, set him perfectly on the path to destruction.camilla macaulay. the first thing that comes to mind is her being the ultimate female manipulator. amount of times i wrote “girlboss” was unhealthy. maybe she is seemingly kind, perhaps innocuous, at first, but then the cold and calculating??? terrible, but sign me up. i would love to see her roast bunny again any day.and bunny corcoran. i’ll take him on vacation, all expenses paid, and leave him there. you’re welcome.charles… not wonderful, yet i feel terrible for him. he had no idea what was happening to himself nor did he want to. he truly was a pawn.the writing offered incredible atmospherics for dark academia lovers (so, me). coming from someone who adores philosophy, perhaps i’m a little biased in saying this novel offered pure perfection in the “academia” aspect of it as well, but it did. casual discussions on harrowing topics? acts of triviality for the sake of a horrific goal? communicating with your classmates in greek and latin around strangers? check, check, and check.as for the unreliable narrator—the story would have fallen apart without him. some complaints of “detached” tones and “endless” descriptions follow many opinions, but those things are vitally necessary. you can’t destroy a perception effectively if you haven’t taken meticulous effort to weave it into existence. richard was different from the other characters because he was the most active bystander, perhaps the most (or least, in a way) morally sound of them all. instead of suffering consequences of his own, he suffered pieces of everyone else’s. his point of view WAS the reason for disillusionment. it was the reason we all loved the first half of the book far more than the second. it’s all about perception. even now, there is no one description for any of the characters. they shift with situation, with time. true complexity.but of course, with every book comes necessary criticism; there is no such thing as a perfect work of literature. the main students of the secret history are elitist and undeniably out of touch with reality. they drown in indulgence and disregard consequences of their actions. in fact, as much as i adore this book, i am not particularly fond of henry winter (gasp) nor do i romanticize him. the 'dark academia' genre is a wild one, and it comes with its flaws, of which are being brought to criticism today. if you're reading this book solely for the ""aesthetic"" and ""vibes"", i strongly advise you to put it down. return it. give it to a friend. or send the copy to me (of course, we all know i need more than  only  five copies). the dark academia you've been promised is definitely there, but it isn't what we should be taking away from the novel. the book practically screams how there is danger (or terror, should i say) in beauty (aka indulgence), meaning there are consequences to the students' actions. like all great works of literature, it's a book worth appreciating just as much as it is worth criticizing and learning from.overall, i did not devour this book—it devoured me. i mean that. instead of burning through this rapidly, i let it eat away at my mind; ten years’ worth of writing isn’t something that merely sits still and lets you continue on, instead it paints itself into the details of reality until you find that it’s now laced into your world. i’ve written myself into this book (quite literally) and this book has read itself into my own scheme of thought. the easiest five stars i've ever given."

The Secret History dazzles with intelligent turns of phrase and dense writing, and doesn't care if you like its characters.

The snow in the mountains was melting and Bunny had been dead for several weeks before we had begun to understand the gravity of our situation.
Doesn't that scream to be read? I read it and went, alright, time to strap in. We're in for a good one. And this book follows its iconic first line with an expertly crafted novel. I won't pretend that that the pacing was perfect—for anyone who's read this, you'll probably agree that it was long. And even if it doesn't take you too long to read, the intense mental musings of the main character, Richard, are so rambling at times and deviate into interesting memories so frequently that it often feels like you're living this multiple-month story with him. In detail. Play by play. This is definitely not a ""who-dun-it"" novel, but a ""why-dun-it."" We know from the jump that this tight-knit group of friends murdered one of their own one crisp spring morning. What we don't know is why, and what happens to them afterward. The Secret History has two parts, the ""before"" the murder in Part 1, and the ""after"" the murder in Part 2. I strongly preferred Part 1, as the suspense was more important—we knew Bunny was going to die, but when? and why? I loved that level of guessing. Once things evolved...eh, it was definitely more of a struggle. I felt the author lost some of the momentum as the tone of the novel shifted into more of a Crime and Punishment vibe.

I don't know why we did it. I'm not entirely sure that, circumstances demanding, we wouldn't do it again. And if I'm sorry, that probably doesn't make much difference.
Donna Tartt is the queen of the intelligent page-turner and if I had to rank her current novels, this would come third. It feels like a younger book than The Little Friend or The Goldfinch and not just because of the age of the characters - even Richard the narrator is still only 28, looking back at his days at college when he was 19-21. It seems to me that this is a book about youth itself: a time when knowledge still feels new, when we are both insecure and invincible, when concepts like death are almost what happens in books, when our personalities are in flux and when what other people think is almost more important that what we think ourselves. Richard is in this pliable stage when he arrives at a tiny college in Vermont and comes under the influence of a charismatic Classicist and a small group of elitist misfits.I found this compulsive reading though Tartt is never brief in her writing - there's a Dickensian excess in her books, as if her imagination needs the space to bed itself in to this rich environment in order to function. And it's worth immersing yourself in this book because too much reality might well make it unbelievable and the book works precisely because we suspend that disbelief. With references to Greek literature and culture (the Apollonian/Dionysian dichotomy, religious ritual and the sublime, allusions to both The Bacchae and the cursed house of Atreus) as well as the Renaissance genre of Jacobean revenge tragedy, this is gloriously literary though I think it would still work without those subtexts that add texture. Not a book for people who need sympathetic characters to root for as everyone is pretty privileged and vile in terms of being above the usual laws that people abide by - but wonderfully baroque entertainment that still manages to keep its feet in reality.

144,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-mridula,Rating 4 out of 5,"There are three types of fiction that I have encountered: those that are (1) plot-driven (2) character-driven and (3) idea-driven. The plot-driven novel is the most simple: it just charges ahead with the story, paying scant attention to characters and ideas – the only aim being to keep the reader entertained. This is the traditional tale told around the campfire, and the “penny dreadful” you purchase at the railway station bookstore to while away a long journey.As the writer gets more serious, she starts to invest more in her characters; even well-written plot-driven stories contain memorable characters, many a time. But some novels become exclusive character-studies, the plot being only a vehicle to explore the nuances of individual psyches (Dostoevsky is the name that immediately springs to mind).Then you have the novel of ideas (a la Thomas Mann) where the novel is only a device to explore ideas, and action takes place mostly in the realm of the characters’ minds as they toss around theses and antitheses. Most literary novels tend to fall in either of the last two categories: or they may combine both, where ideas are explored through the inception, growth and (sometimes) destruction of characters within the frame of the narrative. ‘The Secret History’ by Donna Tartt is such a novel.***The premise is simple: a group of college students murder one of their compatriots (and no, that’s not a spoiler!) as a matter of exigency – and then they struggle to come to terms with the consequences of their action. Told in a straightforward manner, this story would hardly have occupied 200 pages. But Ms. Tartt stretches it out to 600+, as she explores themes of love, death, friendship and betrayal against the backdrop of the Greek Classics.Richard Papen (the first person narrator) trying to escape a mundane life in provincial California, manages to get a scholarship to Hampden College in Vermont, against the wishes of his parents. There, he falls in with a group of students studying Greek under the enigmatic professor Julian Morrow: Francis Abernathy, the twins, Charles and Camilla MacCaulay, Henry Winter and Edmund (“Bunny”) Corcoran. Though initially they seem unapproachable, he soon starts to meld in – and finds that he has joined an unusual fraternity, to say the least. And when things reach such a pass that the imprudent and obnoxious Bunny has to be murdered, Richard has been fully “bought into” their way of living. And for things to go downhill from there is not only possible, but inevitable.***Nowadays, we use the term “tragedy” indiscriminately: a train accident is a tragedy, so is a building collapse, or the outbreak of an epidemic. While these may be disasters, in the true sense of the term, none of them is a “tragedy”. For in the classic sense, tragedy is something that occurs through a flaw in an otherwise heroic main character: jealousy in Othello, covetousness in Macbeth and so on. In a way, the tragic outcome is an inevitable part of the development and growth of the hero: it is foreshadowed in the beginning itself. The tragic hero brings on his own downfall.In this sense, “The Secret History” is a tragedy in its true sense, and Henry Winter the true tragic hero. The author, by situating it within the lecture rooms of the eccentric Julian where the students are actually persuaded not just to study, but to live ancient Greek culture, is underlining it in red ink so that no reader may miss it.Most of ancient mythology is amoral. Morality is a later concept which never affected the Greeks, as their religion had become defunct by then. So we can see Zeus, Poseidon, Hades and the rest of the pantheon happily drinking, stealing, killing, fornicating, carrying out “unnatural” sex... with hardly a judgemental statement in the huge corpus of mythic literature. The group of protagonists in this novel also seem to live in amoral universe, outside of our time stream.Added to this twilight existence is the crucial Bacchanalia: the celebration to the Roman God of pleasure, Bacchus, which is an ecstatic celebration life without any boundaries. And Bacchus is the equivalent of the Greek Dionysus, who, according to Wikipedia, is “the god of the grape harvest, winemaking and wine, of ritual madness, fertility, theatre and religious ecstasy in ancient Greek religion and myth. Wine played an important role in Greek culture, and the cult of Dionysus was the main religious focus for its unrestrained consumption.” And when we realise that tragedies were usually staged during Dionysian festivals, the purpose of Ms. Tartt in creating the framework for her story becomes crystal clear. The characters are transported out of their everyday setting onto the universal stage. Like a perfect tragedy, the drama on the stage transcends the boundaries of time and space and we are able see beyond the immediate into the eternal, and catharsis is complete.***The novel is perfectly structured. While the prologue foreshadows the action, the narrative is split into two halves with the crucial action happening exactly in the middle. The rambling style of writing takes a bit of getting used to, but the prose is rich with many layers of meaning – take it slowly, savouring each paragraph. You will enjoy it."
145,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16392157-merna,Rating 3 out of 5,"I don't understand. This book was just too deep and profound for me. A person as unsophisticated as me could never hope to understand what it all meant. Why were mere five students allowed have their own and only class in college? What did the Greek classics aspect have to do with the overall story? What was the classics professor suppose to symbolise? What was the point of it all in the end? Who knows. All I know is that it had all the elements of what makes any story deep: incest, murder, homosexuality, drugs, rich white kids with issues and stuff to do with classical Greece.On a serious note, the first half was good but after the murder happens all the excitement drains out from the book. There's no more anticipation and it simply becomes anti-climatic. The second half was just bad. You kept hoping something dramatic was going to happen and it kinda does, but it was not the type of drama you were hoping and expecting. I was also irritated by Julian (the so-called 'charismatic classics professor' as described in the back cover of the book). He's suppose to be a significant character and even helps wrap up the whole story. Yet he appears in the book once in order to teach a Greek lesson and then he pops up very briefly throughout the book. Yet towards the end of the story the main character speaks about how he views him as a fatherly figure, but how wrong he was to do so and that he had completely misunderstood the fundamental character of the professor. And I'm just confused because the professor is so undeveloped that his actions towards the ending of the book end up meaning nothing. Rather than the actions of the professor being profound or very surprising, you just end up thinking 'okay, what? What was that all about?'Don't get me started on the rest of the characters. They're all plain and indistinguishable except Bunny.So the book was entertaining nonsense at the beginning, but went downhill in the later half and just became nothing but nonsense."

But I was ignorant then of everything but my own happiness, and I don’t know what else to say except that life itself seemed very magical in those days: a web of symbol, coincidence, premonition, omen. Everything, somehow, fit together; some sly and benevolent Providence was revealing itself by degrees and I felt myself trembling on the brink of a fabulous discovery, as though any morning it was all going to come together–my future, my past, the whole of my life–and I was going to sit up in bed like a thunderbolt and say oh! oh! oh!I first read The Secret History about 25 years ago, at a time when I was the age of the main characters in the story. I remember not only enjoying it, but finding it rather profound.So, after all these years, I decided to re-read The Secret History. Sadly, I was less impressed reading it now. Completely unlikeable characters are one thing. But unrealistic characters are a bigger problem. “What we did was terrible, but still I don't think any of us were bad, exactly; chalk it up to weakness on my part, hubris on Henry’s, too much Greek prose composition – whatever you like.” I guess what I’d like is a narrator looking back on a premeditated murder to admit that at least one person involved in it was bad, exactly.The murder, which is revealed in the first sentence, occurs at the precise midpoint of The Secret History. The first 250 pages—including the introduction to all the characters, and the long buildup to the murder—are pretty great. But much of the last half of the book—the search for Bunny, the funeral, and the police investigation—take place largely off campus, with unimportant side characters, and to no real payoff. You could cut 100-150 pages from the back half of the book (so that the bacchanal takes place at the 1/3 mark, and the murder at the 2/3 mark) without sacrificing any of the novel’s strengths.And to be sure, The Secret History has strengths. It is beautifully written and atmospheric. Regardless of what you think of the story or the characters, Ms. Tartt creates a vivid picture of this wayward group at this exclusive college in the late 1980s. I’m knocking a star off my original rating because I was a bit disappointed on my re-read, but I’d still recommend the book if you’ve never read it. This novel is loved by a lot people for a reason."

I love school settings2. I was genuinely curious to see how the book would develop, considering the most important event, the murder of one of their own, happens right at the beginning, and 3. This is a beloved classic, one touted as the perfect example of “dark academia” and has very high ratings.When I found myself dragging my feet through the paperback, I used one of my Audible credits to download the audiobook — narrated by the author even! This was going to be good.Good lord, it truly wasn’t.This book is... like an alternate version of The Sun Also Rises, only slightly nerdier and in a school setting.Mind you, the nerdy part is probably the most appealing to me: I loved the idea of exploring ancient wisdom and Greek literature while watching these kids getting mixed up in murder plans. But the academic part of it was such a wash — nothing much of consequence was really delved into, everything was just given a passing reference. Like when they try to recreate a Dionysian rite and things go wrong, and absolutely nothing is said about the rite itself, other than the most basic info about Dionysus and the fact that they seemed to “see more”. This is literally the most interesting part of the book (not to mention the catalyst for the main events), CAN YOU PLEASE ELABORATE??But no, instead we are regaled with talk (and talk, and talk, and talk) of these deeply unlikable and mostly unremarkable characters, most of them rich, spoiled, and shallow. Why would I want to read about these people??This book is self-congratulatory, pretentious, tedious, often rambling, and slightly overwritten.It is also at least 200 pages too long, considering that even after all events are explained, we are somehow punished with many other chapters about the survivors’ lives and belly-gazing.The only reason I didn’t DNF this 400 pages in, when I realized that the interesting content I was expecting wasn’t coming, is that I don’t want anyone to ever talk me into giving this another shot. This is truly one of the most pointless books I have ever read and it is puzzling to me that it is so beloved. To each his own, I suppose.

Cinque ragazzi, per la precisione quattro ragazzi e una ragazza, frequentano la scuola andando a lezione da un unico professore che insegna loro il greco antico.Una notte alcuni di loro compiono un omicidio, e la scoperta di quello che è avvenuto per mano di un ragazzo del gruppo, porterà alla decisione di mettere in atto un altro assassinio.Bene, a grandi linee ho riassunto quello che Donna Tartt scrive in 600 pagine. Io non so nemmeno da dove iniziare. Ho riletto la sinossi che trovo nel retro di copertina. Mi viene da ridere. Si parla di una storia folgorante di amicizia e complicità. La complicità c’è di sicuro, sono tutti complici di reati gravi. Ma sono convinta che chi ha scritto la sinossi non intendesse quello, tanto più che complicità viene dopo di amicizia. Amicizia. Questa è amicizia? Questi ragazzi non sono amici. Si odiano, fanno del male agli altri membri del gruppo piuttosto volontariamente, si tengono all’oscuro di cose importanti, e si odiano, mi sembra doveroso ripeterlo.Nella sinossi si parla poi di amore e ossessione. L’ossessione c’è di sicuro; questo branco di ragazzini viziati che non sanno stare al mondo sono ossessionati dalla cultura greca e dai suoi riti, ovviamente i riti peggiori, quelli di Dioniso, il dio dell’estasi, il dio del vino, il dio dell’ebbrezza, il dio delle illusioni. Che poi, probabilmente è solo una scusa per ubriacarsi e drogarsi, ma su questo ci arrivo dopo.Amore. Parliamo di amore? Dove sarebbe in questo libro l’amore? Non si può nemmeno parlare di amor proprio perché per quanto questi personaggi siano egoistici ed egocentrici non distruggono solo gli altri, non distruggono solo qualsiasi cosa toccano, distruggono pure sé stessi. Non c’è rispetto per sé, non c’è integrità morale, non c’è coerenza. Immaginatevi tutte le peggiori cose e buttatele addosso a cinque persone. Ed ecco i protagonisti di Dio di illusioni di Donna Tartt, il clamoroso bestseller tradotto in 23 Paesi. Sentii imperioso il desiderio di afferrare Camilla per il polso ferito, torcerle il braccio dietro la schiena fino a farla urlare, gettarla sul letto: strozzarla, violentarla, non so che altro ancora.Questo è amore, no? Considerate infatti che una pagina prima Richard, il ragazzo che parla, dice di amare Camilla. Chi non desidera fare questo al proprio amato o subire questo dalla persona che ama? Ah, l’amore.Un romanzo di formazione? Questo sarebbe un romanzo di formazione? Perché? C’è forse un percorso di crescita tra queste pagine? Le uniche cose che ho riscontrato in questo romanzo sono state droga, alcol, menefreghismo, odio, violenza, follia, depravazione, e diciamolo, puro nonsense.Facciamo che di seguito vi metto alcune frasi e vi dico quello che secondo me non funziona. Una breve ricerca rivelò che Francis non aveva in casa né tè né caffè. […] Presi il whisky.Ora, io dico. In casa non c’è tè e non c’è caffè quindi mi bevo del whisky? L’acqua è passata di moda? Questi ragazzi bevono alcol a qualsiasi ora del giorno (pure di mattina) e della notte come se nulla fosse, come se fosse la cosa più normale del mondo e soprattutto, come se fosse la cosa più figa del mondo (lo stesso si può dire della droga e del fumo). Questo è il secondo libro che leggo di Donna Tartt e in due libri su due i protagonisti non fanno altro che bere, drogarsi e fumare. Possibile che questa autrice non sappia scrivere altro? Me lo chiedo, davvero. Perché Dio di illusioni e Il cardellino potrebbero andare a braccetto. La differenza è che nel Cardellino la Tartt ha mandato tutto all’aria verso la fine, facendolo diventare una trashata americana solo ad un certo punto, mentre Dio di illusioni è una trashata americana dall’inizio alla fine.Mi rendo conto che ci sto andando pesante; probabilmente questo mi scatenerà le ire (e il defollow) di persone che hanno amato questo libro, ma non ce la posso fare ad essere carina. Mi sono davvero sentita presa in giro da questo libro. Ma andiamo avanti con il nonsense.Ad un certo punto nella storia, Henry, quello che si crede il genio superiore a tutti e una divinità, compra una pala. Cioè, un universitario, che vive in un campus, si compra una pala? Ma per fare cosa? Un orto? E se state pensando che la usi per sotterrare un cadavere, no. Vi sbagliate. Quella pala è stata comprata e mai più apparsa nel corso della storia. Direi un evento decisamente utile ai fini della narrazione e del tutto sensato, no?Quando Richard, il narratore, mentre parla con Henry scopre che il suo gruppetto di “amici” ha ucciso qualcuno, Henry che fa? Scoppia a ridere. Certo. È una cosa talmente divertente uccidere qualcuno, e talmente normale, sì insomma, una di quelle cose che accadono tutti i giorni, che quando qualcuno ci scopre, scoppiamo a ridere in tutta tranquillità. Perché fosse stata una reazione isterica, potevo anche capirla come reazione, ma no, non c’è isteria, zero proprio.E Richard, scoperto questo, cosa fa? Be’, ma ovvio, chiede chi era. Uno scopre che il tizio che ha di fronte ha ucciso un uomo, e sta lì, bello tranquillo, a chiedergli, come prima domanda, chi era.La risposta? Eccola qui: Si strinse nelle spalle. «Una cosa minima, un accidente».Ci rendiamo conto?Ma com’è successo questo? Perché hanno deciso di provare un baccanale. E Richard dice che questa è la cosa più strana che abbia mai sentito. Questa è la cosa più strana che tu abbia mai sentito? Forse la cosa più strana è sentire uno che con nonchalance ti dice di aver ucciso uno sconosciuto? No, così, chiedo.Ma non è finita, perché Richard ha anche il coraggio di dire che non gliene importava nulla. Questi “amici” hanno ucciso un povero disgraziato e a te non interessa? Ma che razza di persona sei? Anzi, riformulo la domanda, ma sei una persona o un mostro?Giriamo il coltello nella piaga e leggiamo quello che dice Henry: «Si è trattato di un penoso incidente e mi dispiace che sia accaduto, ma francamente non vedo come gli interessi del contribuente o i miei medesimi traggano giovamento dal mio soggiorno di sessanta o settant’anni nelle carceri del Vermont.»Be’, che dire, non fa una piega Henry. Il tuo discorso dimostra una grande personalità, grande intelligenza, un forte senso di giustizia e sviluppata moralità, non ci sono dubbi. Kohlberg sarebbe orgoglioso di te. «La gente di Hampden ha sperato per anni che una cosa simile accadesse.»Embè certo, la gente ovviamente spera che degli studenti uccidano qualcuno per poi vederli condannati. Chi non ha queste speranze?E nel frattempo continuano a ridersela eh. Perché mi sembra chiaramente tutto molto divertente.Oh ma aspettate! Le cose divertenti non sono finite. Sapete perché? Ve lo dico subito. Perché il professore di greco sa cos’hanno fatto, e gli va benissimo così. Denuncia? Chiama la polizia? Ma ovviamente no. Perché mai dovrebbe farlo? Non scherziamo su. Greco domani mattina e mi raccomando puntuali.Uno dei ragazzi, Francis, a un certo punto sbotta dicendo che sì, hanno fatto una cosa terribile, ma mica hanno ucciso Voltaire. Come se il valore di una persona e della vita di quella persona cambiasse a seconda dell’identità (o magari del colore della pelle).Un’altra giustificazione che viene usata per spiegare l’assassinio, è il troppo greco. Avete letto bene. Troppo greco. Quindi state attenti. Non studiate troppo greco che poi vi trasformate in assassini. Un ragionamento che non fa una piega.Parliamo della ricchezza. Chiaramente mi riferisco all’ambito strettamente monetario perché è chiaro che questi personaggi siano sterili e vuoti quanto un campo di cemento in mezzo al Sahara.L’unico di davvero ricco è Henry, che è ricco però solo perché i genitori gli pagano qualsiasi cosa. Gli altri sono tutti poveri in canna, eppure hanno i soldi per stare al college, per vivere lì, per acquistare vestiti firmati, per farseli lavare e stirare in lavanderia piuttosto che arrangiarsi e soprattutto per acquistare alcol e droghe. Come si spiega tutto ciò? Ah io non lo so, evidentemente non lo sa manco Donna Tartt perché di spiegazioni non ce ne sono.Altra cosa che non mi spiego e che non so se mi faccia ridere o piangere: due poliziotti, mica poliziotti qualsiasi tra l’altro, si parla di FBI, non sanno che possono esistere dei gemelli maschio e femmina. Ma la cosa che fa ancora più ridere (sì, a questo punto rido) è che uno dei due è sposato con una donna che ha dei cugini gemelli (le coincidenze!) i quali vanno spesso a dei congressi di gemelli (ma dai?) e poi raccontano loro cose a riguardo. Di sicuro non è mai venuto fuori che esistono dei gemelli maschio e femmina, figuriamoci.Oh be’, poi non poteva mancare l’incesto. Come dimenticarsi di lui.Mi capite? Come faccio a stare calma e tranquilla di fronte a un libro del genere? Non ce la posso fare, mi dispiace.Qualcuno poi mi spiega perché Richard ogni volta che apre bocca dice bugie? Ma nemmeno quando c’è un motivo valido per farlo. Fate finta che io oggi abbia mangiato la pizza. Voi mi chiedete cos’ho mangiato e io vi rispondo dicendovi un piatto di carbonara. Perché diavolo dovrei mentire su una cosa del genere? Non ha senso. Eppure Richard mente e basta, non fa altro (oltre a bere e drogarsi s’intende).Per non parlare poi della notte del primo omicidio. Le cose non reggono. Innanzitutto l’autrice non spiega davvero com’è successo. Si sono drogati? Hanno bevuto? Hanno fumato? Si sono solo immaginati di essere drogati, bevuti e fumati? Non si sa. Viene detto che Camilla era più avanti del gruppo, che al momento dell’omicidio non era lì presente. Eppure viene ritrovata con i capelli e la testa insanguinata. Viene data una spiegazione? Ma assolutamente no.E aggiungiamoci che questi vanno al college. Hanno tra i 20 e i 24 anni, come età anagrafica almeno, perché dai comportamenti, dal modo di pensare e di agire, sembra che abbiano dieci anni in meno. Tant’è che per moltissime pagine, nonostante sapessi che andavano al college, nella mia testa erano dei ragazzini adolescenti perché questo era quello che mi trasmettevano con la loro personalità.Io davvero non capisco come questo libro abbia potuto fare successo. Ho letto recensioni di persone che hanno dato il massimo dei voti a Dio di illusioni (e sono davvero felice se a qualcuno è piaciuto questo libro) e quelle recensioni trasmettono poesia, trasmettono visioni che wow, potrebbero anche farti innamorare del libro di cui si sta parlando. Ma poi ti rendi conto che tu quel libro lo hai letto, e ti chiedi, non con saccenteria ma con pura curiosità, se si tratta dello stesso libro perché in Dio di illusioni di Donna Tartt non c’è bellezza. O forse c’è e io non la vedo. Chiaro, ci sta. Ma il nonsense e gli eventi irrealistici che accadono dove li mettiamo? Li abbiamo considerati?L’unico pregio di questo libro è che si legge velocemente per lo stile di dell’autrice. Devo però aggiungere che ci sono delle parti davvero noiose, pesanti, ridondanti e il libro potrebbe essere lungo la metà.Mi dispiace, davvero. Io ho provato a scovare la bellezza finché leggevo; ho provato a scovare frasi che mi sarei segnata perché mi trasmettevano qualcosa (effettivamente mi hanno trasmesso qualcosa, ma emozioni non propriamente positive come avrete capito); ho provato pure a stare calma finché scrivevo, ma il problema è che mettere per iscritto le cose che non ho proprio mandato giù mi hanno fatto pensare ancora una volta al fatto che mi sono sentita presa in giro dall’autrice. E questa probabilmente è la cosa peggiore che può capitare con un libro."

I expected something different, but I can’t say how it turned out to be was terrible. For sure, this book makes you think. This review will be spoiler free and perhaps a little vague, because I wouldn’t want to ruin it for anyone:)  I suppose at one time in my life I might have had any number of stories , but now there is no other. This is the only story I will ever be able to tell.  The story itself is divided into 2 parts, with 4 chapters in each, plus an epilogue. I was pretty shocked seeing a 500+ book having only 8 chapters to be honest😂The story starts with the narrator, Richard, telling us in the first paragraph he and his friends kill one of the people in their friend group (I won’t say who though). The first part is basically getting up to the point of the death of this person, how it happened and why. It was decent.The second part is a slog. It’s very boring and almost pointless. We have the funeral which is a chapter itself, and it just ends up being very pointless until the final 20 pages or so. The ending itself shocked me, I didn’t quite expect it to end that way. The epilogue is pretty straight forward as well, if not a bit unnecessary at times.In itself the pacing of this book is not that good, but it’s made up for in the writing.The writing is really good. And I suppose it’s the type of writing that’s basic and detailed, which is fine. I think the atmosphere created by it is really one of the best parts of this book. The dark academia theme and vibe to this book is really it’s best factor.  Does such a thing as “the fatal flaw,” that showy dark crack running down the middle of a life, exist outside literature? I used to think it didn’t. Now I think it does. And I think that mine is this: a morbid longing for the picturesque at all costs.  The characters themselves I hated. They are meant to be unlikable, but guys , I read Wuthering Heights, which is practically the classic of unlikable characters, and yet somehow I connected to them. This book just made the characters insufferable.Richard, our MC, is a side character in his own story. His POV is overly detailed at times and often really boring.Henry is a boring white boy that has zero personality and I didn’t like.Francis is the best character in my opinion. He’s funny, and mysterious ish, and I guess he has some personality.Charles is gross. I don’t need to say the abusive and incestous nature of him makes him disgusting because that’s obvious.Camilla is also doing incest although wether she was forced to or not is the question. She was bland and boring though, so I couldn’t care.Julian, the professor, is barley in this book and basically only existed for one important scene before dipping. I hate him though. Bunny is a homophobic boy that’s super annoying so no❤️I feel this is a weird note to make but this book would’ve been better if it was gay. Okay yes Francis is gay, and Richard spends a whole page wondering if Henry is gay and makes a list in his brain to see if he is not not, but the romance isn’t there. And I rarely say a book would be better if it were gay because a romance is a romance. If the author writes it poorly, I don’t think the gender of the individuals involved would make it better. But this book literally has the potential to be a tragic gay dark academic romance and that’s amazing. M/M tragic romances are becoming one of my favourite things (to the great pain of my heart). Examples of such are The Song Of Achilles and If We Were Villains, two books I 1000% recommend. But yeah this book needed a romance plot line and it had to be gay✨Anyways overall the plot was okay. The first part was good but I was sad this certain part was never described in detail because it seemed really important.And I guess I just wished there were more of the classes on page? Because the best scene in this book was the class in the first chapter, no doubt.In conclusion this book was something. I do recommend it because it brings up some interesting perspectives and makes you think. But it wasn’t for me, at the end of the day.  “Beauty is rarely soft or consolatory. Quite the contrary. Genuine beauty is always quite alarming.”"
158,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/81432722-olivia,Rating 4 out of 5,"----------------------------------mar 4, 2023I did it. It took me 10 years, 2 copies, and wrestling with the audiobook, but I finally did it—I’ve read the dark academia girlies founding text and the irony of its popularity is…The way this book stands in sharp contrast to Colleen Hoover’s ‘It Ends With Us’ as the poster children of two very popular but very different sides of BookTok is somewhat perplexing. Although I didn’t enjoy the reading experience, I can’t deny how brilliantly smart this book is. Quite ironically, ‘The Secret History’ has come to define the aesthetic it aims to reject. ‘The Secret History’ is a modern take on greek tragedy but there is no deus ex machina only divine justice with terrible actions having terrible consequences. Through Richard’s eyes, we are captivated by the glamour of a secretive group of classics students. They appear perfect, almost mystical, but as Richard penetrates their ranks he comes face to face with the fatal flaw in each of them, decaying their character from the inside out. Although the significance of most of the classic texts referenced by Tartt undoubtedly went right over my head, I did look into the title, which takes its name from a text by Procopius—one written in secret about the pervasive rot behind Byzantium's beautiful facade. Quite cleverly, Tartt mirrors this fall from grace in her own novel, ripping beauty at the seams to reveal the harsh pretentious truth behind the cult-like classics students at Hampden college. Side note: I will be thinking about the role Julian played in all this for a long time (racketeering ? Cult leader? Henry’s mentor?) ( 3.5 rounded to 4 because I didn't love the reading experience but the more I think about this book the more I think it's very clever.)----------------------------------sept 10, 2021DNF at 100 pgs This is the second time I DNF this book. It’s just so dull and dense to start out, nothing about it captivates me. Donna Tart’s writing is atmospheric, but the characters are so pretentious I’m not at all curious to stick with it. Will i revisit this? Probably, but for now it’s going back on my shelf unread."
159,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56542831-bella,Rating 5 out of 5,"“It is is better to know one book intimately than a hundred superficially.” Trigger/Content warning: murder, incest, alcoholism, drug abuse, attempted suicide, physical, sexual and verbal abuse, racism, homophobia, animal cruelty, slut shaming, ableism, self-harm, rituals, classism, etc. Ah where to begin with this book. When I first read it, I was conflicted, did I like this book? Did I not? Now, several months later, it is a book I think about quite often, a book I use as a standard which I compare other books to. This book is haunting.Donna Tartt is the author of two of my favorite books of all time; I wonder why hehe. Her way with words is simply unmatched, she hooks you in with her clever and articulate writing and keeps you engaged with her plot. The prose, the aesthetic, the setting, the characters, everything was so beautiful and elegant. The Secret History, a modern-day Greek tragedy, follows Richard as he transfers into a private liberal arts college and discovers an elitist “Classics” group he wishes to join. He quickly makes the acquaintance of Julian, the professor of the Greek program, and his classmates, Henry, Bunny, Francis, Charles, and Camilla. He quickly learns that these people share his intellect. This is the story of a murder, of privilege, of class. The Secret History is divided into two parts, before and after the murder. As the second part began, it felt like the story was losing its coherence and beauty, my attachment was slowly slipping away, however everything quickly fell back into place when I realized the reason I felt that way was due to the incredible narration. Richard is the epitome of an unreliable narrator, everything is turned and twisted through his eyes. I could no longer trust the words on the page, I detached myself from the story completely and started piecing things together on my own. This only enhanced my reading experience and made this book more enjoyable.There is nothing clear about this book, your understanding of it stems from your own perception of the characters. The batshit crazy characters, that is. The Secret History is nothing short of a disturbing masterpiece.I loved it:)"

Richard is telling us this story years after he has already moved on from it. we are not experiencing it in real time but only through the parts of his memory that remain of it. and as he tells us from the very first paragraph, he has  ""a morbid longing for the picturesque.""  which means he is right off the bat an unreliable narrator. meaning that he will remember things slightly incorrect due to his desire for a 'picturesque' story. this flaw of his is easily seen in his  ever shifting view of Henry and Camilla. despite the characters being  pretty much insane murderers,  i loved them. there was just something simply magnetic about them. the characters were all complex, imperfect, flawed, which is what i enjoyed the most. it made them feel so much more real and human.I found the story to be completely gripping and I found myself relating to the way Richard was very much an outsider even among his own friends. Friends whom never tried to understand him and he never quite got around to understanding either. The thirst to prove yourself, struggling to fit yet trying not to hard, hesitancy for asking help, a people pleasing innateness, thoughtful, avoiding confrontation as much as possible.. made Richard a simple and humane character. I believe it's the feral and raw flaws of these characters and the way the author makes us justify their mistakes are the things I love about this book. some quotes i loved: ""Forgive me, for all the things I did but mostly for the ones that I did not.”“Love doesn’t conquer everything. And whoever thinks it does is a fool.” “I am nothing in my soul if not obsessive.” "

It's hard to care about these pretentious teenagers, talking about Greek, philosophy and whatever else. Maybe it is because I personally don't know even one student (and I have spent a fair amount of time in undergraduate and graduate school) that was this wrapped up in these subjects. My experience with school was more practical, with people studying to get jobs, worrying about paying their tuition bills, meeting deadlines and passing exams. Students in this book, as well as in The Marriage Plot, are foreign to me, I fail to understand their thoughts and aspirations. "

Its a wonderful debut- psychological novel with an interesting protagonist— California born, Richard Papen. The Vermont liberal arts college setting with a bunch of Greek scholars is inviting —— but I had to suspend belief about the main story and the characters several times. We meet *THE* Professor, Julian Morrow, (Holier than thou), and his exclusive group of students. Besides Richard, we meet Henry Winter, Frances Abernathy, Edmund Corcoran,(Bunny), and twins Charles and Camilla Macaulay. Each of these characters have distinctive qualities - backgrounds, and personalities. Five male students and one female student…..and reflections on what lead up to a murder….of “Bunny”. Ha……But….. …..This is one of those times (again) - when so many people have already read it — (with over 14,000 ratings) — another review from me — is certainly not necessary— But…..I’ll share a few things anyway. Right away, I felt similarities with “Dead Poet’s Society”. The other thing I noticed (ha—doing a little comparing with another book I’m reading “The Covenant of Water”, by Abraham Verghese)….is that both books are long with heavy descriptive prose. The difference for me is — I ‘feel’ the purpose for the descriptions in “The Secret Society”….and the purpose > interacting with the other students and their intricate-involved relationships…..(each inebriated much of the time), throughout this story. But  …..in “The Covenant of Water” …..I ‘don’t’ always understand the reason for the embellished descriptive prose…the added side-bar stories that feel like unnecessary tangents. But back to “The Secret History”…..I enjoyed it — not as much as “The Goldfinch”….but it was ‘fun’…..with cuckoo twists and unbelievable plots. Great writing….Greek loyalty, sacrifice, tragedy….. …..part thriller — part social satire. The famous first line: “The snow in the mountains was melting and Bunny had been dead for several weeks before we came to understand the gravity of our situation”. "

She has immersed us in a masterful unraveling of a crime by five east coast college students who are studying the classics. She sets it in a picturesque stereotypical New England college and town, complete with autumnal weather patterns, crisp air, winter snow storms and spring blossoms.The characters' wealth, their elitist and separatist attitudes, their knowledge of Greek and Latin works, and their interpersonal relationships can seem repetitive but they are never dull. Bunny's cocky irreverence, Camilla's ethereal being, Charles's conflicted loyalties, Francis' fidgety-ness and Henry's stiff formality are superb portrayals of privileged young adults whose wealth cannot protect them from themselves. The first person narrator is reminiscent of Poe. This is definitely about the atmospheric journey not the destination.The writing is addicting and truly masterful."

Maybe the Greeks accidentally killed people when they were striving to attain Nirvana and maybe they didn't. Inadvertently, we did kill people and then that lead to a whole new problem....

On the one hand, it's very atmospheric and can be very suspenseful at times. On the other hand, it's elevated language sometimes seems out of place, and it can drag during the calmer sections. The first and third sections are quite good while the second was dull and hard to get through. I swear that the characters spend half of their time asking where each other are located (if I had to read ""Where's Camilla?"" one more time, I was going to abandon the book), and the sentence ""[He/She/I] awoke with a start,"" was used so many times that I would audibly groan every time I heard it.The story is good, but this book really could have used a good edit for length.

Muy pesada y contemplativa con elementos de ambientación que solo dan rodeos. Pero ese no es el problema en realidad, lo que pasa es que para tener por móvil un crimen que desde el momento uno sabes por quién fue ejecutado y quién fue el asesinado resulta bastante aburrido seguir el hilo.No termina de explotar. Me parece todo el tiempo anticlimático. No hay un punto de quiebre para empatizar ni para encontrar algo interesante en sus personajes que me parecen muy fríos, casi acartonados.Quiero seguir leyendo a la autora porque recibe muchas alabanzas y tienen uno que otro premio encima pero de momento, aunque no tenía expectativas salí muy decepcionado."
175,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59033840-althea,Rating 4 out of 5,"You definitely have to understand that this book has a satire undertone to appreciate it. I wouldn’t read this for it’s mystery but more so for the writing, atmosphere, commentary and feeling of getting buried into a narrative with characters you aren’t expecting to love. I see why this is a polarizing book either way.That isn’t to say I didn’t find the mystery shocking because… i was shocked. The themes are well preserved and played out. I love it.
“Beauty is rarely soft or consolatory. Quite the contrary. Genuine beauty is always quite alarming.”
It’s dark and slow paced, full of irony and easter eggs. To me, the point of this book was how boring, pretentious, and arrogant the setting & theme actually is. I understand when people say how bland Richard is but I regress to say that it’s what puts the whole story into focus while driving it’s point. The fact that pretentious ignorance, arrogance, and superiority complexes became the foundational pillars for the ironic problems in this story…. hit hard.Although, the most creative aspect from a reader’s perspective was, to me, how the mystery was written and presented to the reader in a non-linear manner. My curiosity was being fed and the way the timeline was spread throughout the book rather it be a linear plot, intriguing me.
“Forgive me, for all the things I did but mostly for the ones that I did not.”
The characters are meant to be unlikable. But it drives the relatability of reading from richard’s pov and how conflicted his feelings towards the rest of the characters are. Even though there are areas of the plot that irked me, I have to admit that this is one of those mystery books that I could actually feel sinking into me. I wasn’t just reading scene after scene happening but was actually feeling how everything played out.Moreover, at first I thought I hated the funeral chapters but I have come to realize that it translates how grief plays out in real life. It feels long, grueling, never ending… and ironic that mundane tasks play on in the middle of your grief that you just have to deal with. BUT! but. What’s real ironic is that they weren’t actually grieving and more complex emotions were at play. Their own instincts for survival kicking in over their grief.
“It is is better to know one book intimately than a hundred superficially.”
Someone mentioned how Bunny by Mona Awad is a homage to The Secret History and I definitely see that. Something clicked and I just have more appreciation for Bunny, both the book and the character. Even if you don't end up loving TSH, I see how you'll appreciate it for it's contribution to modern english literature. lol I’m amused because I started this book 2 years ago and hated it at the beginning. I was gifted a physical copy by a friend and thought to give it another chance. I am beyond glad I did. 
“In short: I felt my existence was tainted, in some subtle but essential way.”
I was so surprised to find out that this was published in 1992, that’s more than 30 years ago from the time of writing. It feels modern, timely, and something that i expected was written in the early 2000s. So I’m surprised to see how it tests the trials of time given that I can see easter eggs of history and modern coincidences sprinkled throughout the book. The fact that it’s still a widely talked about novel now, is interesting and stands to show how polarizing of a read it is.This was addicting to read. The reason this wasn’t 5 stars was more for my opinion of how the plot turns out than the actual writing. Ultimately, your mood when starting/reading this book will decide your enjoyment.
“There are such things as ghosts. People everywhere have always known that. And we believe in them every bit as much as Homer did. Only now, we call them by different names. Memory. The unconscious.”
I do think the writing is exquisite and Donna Tart is a MASTER at setting the atmosphere of a book. I am still snickering a lil bit from that ending.Read it for the vibes and you’ll be all set.— 4.0 —content warnings // slut shaming, use of the R word, homophobia, hate speech, fatphobic comments, racist comments, animal cruelty, sexual assault, incest, performing rituals, suicide, alcoholism, drug abuse, and murder"
176,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11622254-jeanette-pham-semi-hiatus,Rating 5 out of 5,"My review does not contain any spoilers here!The Secret History is the first novel written by Donna Tartt and she debuted her novel in September 1992. 



Before I'll move on to the next topic, I just wanted to say that I've never read any of Donna Tartt's books until I started reading The Secret History. The reason why I've decided to read it was because I participated my very first BOTM, and I've seen some great reviews about it. ☺️ What's the book about?The Secret History is about a 28-years-old man named Richard Papen - who is a graduate student in California and is the main character and narrator in the story. Since he is the narrator in the story he will tell his story on how he and his friends killed Bunny and then goes on to tell the story of how the event happened. Richard will also tell his story on how he left his hometown in Plano, California to study at the elite Hampden College in Vermont, and how he met his classmates in the ancient Greek class: Henry Winter, Charles Macaulay, Camilla Macaulay, Francis Abernathy and of course Edmund ""Bunny"" Corcoran. My thoughts and opinions on The Secret HistoryAfter I finished reading The Secret History I was like ""Wow this book is dark"". Not only it was dark, but it was also haunting too. I usually read my favorite genres such as fantasy, romance, YA and NA but to be honest with you I've actually enjoyed it a lot. I didn't expect to enjoy it either! Okay let's go into on what I liked & disliked about the book: What I liked about The Secret History?🍁 The plotThe plot was amazing! The Secret History is divided in: prologue, part I, II and III, and epilogue. Each parts were exciting but personally I love part III. 🍁 Donna Tartt's writing styleBeautiful, elegant, chic, unique and poetic. 🍁 FrancisI hope I'm not the only one who thinks that Francis are better than the rest of the group. I love his personality too! 😃✨  What I disliked about The Secret History?🍁 BunnyEdmund ""Bunny"" Corcoran. Annoying, dumb and stupid. I just don't like Bunny, okay! 😂 When he met Richard for the first time I already felt suspicious of him because the way he talks and acts toward Richard and to his friends, makes me want to vomit. The way he treats his friends makes me want to vomit too. There were some parts where I felt triggered which made me want to give him a big punch. So nope: I don't like Bunny. 😤🍁 Charles*sigh* Charles... I used to like him but as the story progresses he's just disgusting. 🙃🍁 Short chapters Remember, it has 595 pages and it has only 8 chapters and an epilogue which made me a bit impatient. Like, I will be excited if I see another new chapter but when I read The Secret History I was like ""Oh my gosh when will I reach to the next chapter!? 😩"". And each chapter has like 66 pages! 🤯 🍁 Only Richard's POVI did enjoy reading Richard's point of view (because he's obviously the main character and narrator of course), but it would be interesting to read the other character's point of view. Especially Henry and Francis!🍁 EpilogueI don't know what to say expect that the epilogue made me feel sad *sigh*. 😭 SummaryIt's fantastic! 🤩👏 Again like I said, it was enjoyable to read The Secret History and I like it a lot! I'm glad that I've read it! If you like dark academia, classics, mystery and contemporary you might like The Secret History. 💛 How many stars would I give to The Secret History?4.5 ⭐️If you want to have a book talk about The Secret History, feel free to send me a DM. I love to hear your thoughts and opinions too 💛"

I'm sure the characters are mostly unlikable, but I worried about all of them like they were real people and wanted them to pull things together and find a way to be happy.My only complaint was that they didn't seem like particularly good students (until the end, when we get a very quick look at how they're much better at Greek than other people). I get that more attention to the process of them learning Greek probably wouldn't fly with most readers, but I was more curious about what that looks like and how it changed their perspectives. There's a ton of that already, sure, but I guess for a book focusing on an elite group of students, it was odd that they mostly seemed like bad students.Hey but whatever, really it was a page turner and presented a very careful look, through some dramatic events, about how hard college can be on people. Oh and there are murders and searches for meaning in life and that kind of stuff. Pretty bleak overall, but it makes a real statement about learning and academia. I think it'll stick with me."

""Does such a thing as 'the fatal flaw,' that showy dark crack running down the middle of a life, exist outside literature? I used to think it didn't. Now I think it does. And I think that mine is this: a morbid longing for the picturesque at all costs.""– Donna Tartt, The Secret History; chapter one, paragraph one
the story follows a Californian named Richard who moves to a private college in New England. he becomes enthralled in a group of rich, pretentious students obsessed with the classics – and they murder someone. (that's not really a spoiler; it's the first thing you learn.) but that's not really what the story is ~about~. those are the facts but it feels indescribable. it's like trying to explain someone's LIFE – filled with twists and turns and filler. in a lot of ways, it IS like reading about someone's life.so, these characters: they're terrible. they're either racist or homophobic or abusive or problematic in some other way. BUT for some reason, i kind of love them. i was somehow drawn to all of them, in their own individual ways. they were all so interesting and authentic. the story is told in first-person, past-tense and it actually feels like Richard (the main character) is telling this story – not an author telling a story of a story.my favorite part of this novel is, by far, the ambiance. it was probably the main reason i felt so strongly about everything. i could see them all so clearly – a grainy, tinted, picturesque film in the 60s. set on the backdrop of lush trees and greek literature, it all seems so... perfect. the stark contrast of the actual plot was still part of it; it just felt like a stain or a layer underneath the costumes. it's so picturesque it almost seems fake (in a real way???). it's a contemporary, but Donna Tartt's writing makes it so atmospheric it almost feels like a fantasy (it's not actually, but you know what i mean).this book feels uselessly big. much of it is just Richard recalling little things on their year – trips to the bar, dinner conversations, so on. however, if the story was anything less, i don't think i'd be able to appreciate it as much. these small, mundane things added up to the bigger picture. it was WHY i could see the setting so clearly, and why the characters were so fleshed out. it reminded me of real life because real life is usually filled with filler. buuut it is quite long and difficult to finish in one sitting.the writing took some getting used to. it starts off with many references to characters and actions you've yet to learn, but it's written in a way that assumes you already know. as the pages turn, you're like, ""OHH that makes sense now."" immediately upon finishing, i felt compelled to start all over again. (i actually did start again, about halfway through, then again after i actually finished.) that's to say: it'll probably be a joy to reread.those were my main thoughts on The Secret History. albeit long and unusual, i loved this novel."

Možda nije puko pitanje godina, decenija i vekova, već ostavljenog otiska na svest čitalačke publike- iz generacije u generaciju. "" Tajna istorija"" se uklapa u oba parametra, to je jedna od ""onih knjiga"" univerzalno poznatih skoro svima, a danas, trideset i neku godinu od objavljivanja, moderni čitaoci se mahom dele na one koji su je čitali i one koji će je čitati. U svakom slučaju, možemo reći da je u pitanju, kako izdavači vole da navedu, moderni klasik.Moderni klasik Done Tart započinje ubistvom, ali već od prve rečenice znamo počinioce, stoga refleksnoj kategorizaciji(triler, triler!) ovde mesta nema. Nije pitanje ""Ko?"" već ""Zašto?"", a odgovor nam donosi jednu od najkompleksnijih i najkompletnijih književno-psiholoških studija. Mala grupa studenata polu-elitnog Hempden koledža, pod uticajem profesora klasičnih jezika, upušta se u alternativnu stvarnost i poteru za transcendentalnim postojanjem, sa tragičnim posledicama. Izolovanost je jedan od stubova radnje. Svaki od glavnih aktera je otuđen na jedan ili više načina. Emocionalna i psihološka alijenacija, beg od ruine porodičnog života; zamena jedne samoće za drugu u želji da se, bar nekako, bude deo kolektiva, duboko ukorenjeno mentalno nasleđe straha od večite materijalne oskudice i svest da si svega jednu generaciju udaljen od siromaštva iz kog su tvoji potekli; maskiranje sopstvene mizantropije velom kvazi- intelektualizma. Ima tu još mnogo odgovora na ono ""Zašto?"". Put do istine sakriven je u lirskim pasažima Done Tart, rečenicama i stilom pripovedanja koje će odjekivati kroz još mnogo generacija.Kada je objavljena, ""Tajna istorija"" delovala je egzotično, plod velike mašte o skupini nekih tamo. Danas, neki tamo su postali ovi ovde, a dok se izuzetak sve više pripitomljava u pravilo, ova knjiga postaje sve relevantnija.Neki će reći da je predugačka, sa previše praznog hoda. Mada, ako razmislimo, sva navedena stanja mentalnog kolapsa su kao fitilj koji sporo sagoreva. Bršljan na pojedinačni prozor u svet, polako uzima svetlost, iz dana u dan, dok jednom čovek ne ostane u potpunom mraku."

I was never interested in The Secret History because I read that it was about murder committed by a group of college students and that just didn'tappeal to me at all . Because there are glowing reviews by several of my Goodreads friends and so many 5 star ratings, I thought I would try.I tried and it’s just not for me. I should have trusted by initial gut feeling about the book. It's not that the writing isn't good, it's great. I just did not enjoy the story. I read a little more than half of the book and I have no desire to go any further. I won't give it a rating since I am abandoning it. Maybe I just didn't get it, but that's okay with me.

The Secret History is a murder mystery where the murder is revealed in the introduction. So, it's not a real murder mystery, it's a murder mystery in reverse. Or something.Nevertheless, I found the novel to be really compelling, even though I loathed practically every character. The upper-class, priviledged, rich, spoiled young people aren't exactly the likable sort, especially concerning the crime they commit, which is the murder of one of their friends. Face it: they're rich snobs, and murderers. But what drove them to murder? Is there justification? Can any murder be justified?Or ""murder"" the right word? Bunny, the character who's murdered on the first page, is quite probably the most loathsome character ever written, and for that reason alone Tartt's novel stands out from many mysteries and thrillers. I don't know if it's a modern classic, as the back cover proudly announces - who's to judge that? - but so far Bunny remains one of the few fictional characters for whom I felt palpable hate. Tartt grabs the feelings of the reader...and squishes them, pouring the bloody remains onto the page, with surgical precision aiming exactly where it hurts.This is a compelling novel, even though the characters are unsympathetic: their story is compelling, and the pages turn themselves. It is quite a feat, as it concerns the school life of students who learn ancient Greek. Although I enjoy novels concerning school life, some elements here could be expanded a lot more: the ""special teacher"" that's such a mystery at the beginning is completely undeveloped and therefore completely wasted. His character is easily the most interesting, and could prove for endless possibilities, which Tartt never considered.I have a hard time recommending The Secret History to anyone, because it does play with your feelings in the most unpleasant way. It's truly painful to read at times, not because it's bad but because it's good at being bad. It plays with your emotions, yet never manipulates them. It's also compelling and intelligent, and its 600 or so pages genuinely fly by. Read at your own risk - but be careful when you meet a group of people looking for new ferns. "

I do believe that great books lead to an accumulation of small alterations which further develops a, thinking-self. This is a self, in Svenn Birketts article in a past issue of the American Scholar, that exists parallel but apart from the self that is goal-oriented and copes with the world. This other self is inward, reflective, contemplative, associative and devoid of goals. It exists for and within itself. It leads us to face and explore the burden of the self rather than flee to conformity and acceptance, groups and organizations we can safely huddle within as members, religions and philosophies where we can gain a name, a stance, a conjured identity.It is this interior life that I strive for and this book has added its small but significant alteration. It accomplishes this with no bravado or bows. It employs the beauty of language not trying to be beautiful. The book has no need. It knows its own breadth. The first person narrator is Tartt's genius. She set her camera lens at the precise distance for this meaningful story to be told. Without ever notifying us she resets the delicate lens as she allows the young narrator to mature and develop. She is so quiet and confident.Early in the book she let's us know what it is to be about, so it will not be a spoiler for me to reveal it in this review. The narrator coming from a dull town in California attends a small private college in Vermont. He signs up for Greek, his fallback, not knowing what else to do. He finds himself joining a group of five other students, four boys and one girl, who have been together for some time. All their classes will be taught by a professor considered peculiar by the rest of the faculty but is kept on because of his years served and his not accepting pay for his teaching. The administration is inept and little oversight is provided. There was for me the thrill of intense study, research, the gain of knowledge and promise if wisdom. Julian the professor, ""...was a marvelous talker, a magical talker..."". When filling out a review of him later one of the students complained how difficult to explain on a form since they were in the presence of the, ""Divine.""During one of the first Greek classes Julian lectures, ""All truly civilized people-the ancients no less than us-have civilized themselves through the willful repression of the old, animal self. Are we, in this room,really very different from the Greeks or the Romans? Obsessed with duty, piety, loyalty, sacrifice? All those things which are to modern tastes so chilling."" A few lines further, ""And it's a temptation for any intelligent person, and especially for perfectionists such as the ancients and ourselves, to try to murder the primitive emotive, appetitive self. But that is a mistake."" Further, ""The more cultivated a person is, the more intelligent, the more repressed, then the more he needs some method of channeling the primitive impulses he's worked so hard to subdue. Otherwise those powerful old forces will mass and strengthen until they are violent enough to break free, more violent for the delay, often strong enough to sweep the will away entirely."" He offers the ancient Greeks as a solution; ""To sing, to scream, to dance barefoot in the woods in the dead of night, with no more awareness of mortality than an animal! These are powerful mysteries. The bellowing of bulls. Springs of honey bubbling from the ground. If we are strong enough in our souls we can rip away the veil and look that naked, terrible beauty right in the face; let God consume us, devour us, unstring our bones. Then spit us out reborn."" At the beginning of one class he announces, ""I hope we are all ready to leave the phenomenal world and enter into the sublime.""The heightened writing leads to heightened tension as each character lives a consuming trail of self evasion through endless bottles of alcohol and pills, swallowed and popped during all times of day and night. Tartt must have partied herself because she got it right. How would I know...that's for another review. The abundance is obsessive. They have removed themselves from their self, from reality by existing in a cover of fog. It is furthered by taking on false roles, delving into the costumery of condescension and acts of class privilege. Their immersion into study, reading, academics, serves as another role to evade the burden of the self-a tricky proposition since I am reading about reading being an evasion of the self. They are lost as a mystery builds within the story. This is a true suspenseful mystery where I could not put down the book. I had to find out what happened next. The magic was that the mystery was not tacked on as a twin billing. Seamlessly, it emanated from the story. Form and content, art carefully but appearing effortlessly stitched together.So, yes there was from this exceptional book a small alteration leading to a further accumulation of such alterations resulting in the further richness of my inner life. That is as much if not more than I can ask for. "
193,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70726259-briana,Rating 5 out of 5,"“But how can you possibly justify cold-blooded murder?” “I prefer to think of it as redistribution of matter.”Welp, I did it. There isn’t anything that I can write in this review that hasn’t already been said in the past 30 years and said more eloquently than I could ever pull off. Because of that, I’m going to treat this as less of a review and more of a space for me to spew my many thoughts about this book. Spoilers ahead!1. The chapters were SO LONG. I thought it would bother me more than it actually did, but once I started reading, it was impossible to put the book down. Donna Tartt made 60 pages feel like 10, and that is sorcery, my friends 🤯2. The fact that the book wasn’t explicitly stated to happen in a certain time period, is what will make it live on for ever and ever. 3. I expected Julian to play a bigger role than he did. I see how he is essentially the “cult-leader,” where his teachings were so internalized by Henry, who was the instigator of all major events in the book. But once Julian learned that his teachings actually worked he just *poof* disappeared. Interesting? Strange? I don't know how to feel about that.4. The fact that the entire book is told from the POV of our outcast and unreliable narrator, Richard, was just as frustrating as it was genius. What do we know about Camilla because of this: Essentially, nothing. Since we see Camilla only through his romanticized lens, we never really learn much about her character at all. At least, not in the same way we learn about all the other boys in the friend group. Camilla is this sort of Greek Goddess to Richard that he always wants but can never have. Even when these INSANE things are revealed to have happened to her, it never really means much to Richard. Oh, she's been abused and forced into incest with her brother? But look how beautiful she is. She went mute for a period of time after the first murder? No, let’s not ask how she's doing but instead marvel at how the sun hits her face just right at this angle.5. On to our sociopath, Henry… This man scared me from the second he was introduced. His end, although it seemed to have come out of nowhere, makes a lot of sense when you think about what Julian meant to him and how quickly he fled from their lives. He just had no one to impress anymore, and at the end of the day, no matter how much he loved Camilla (can sociopaths even love?), what love could possibly grow from being the one to kill her brother? Side note: WHAT DID HE WHISPER TO CAMILLA AT THE END? WHAT WAS IT? Why do authors feel the need to write something in a story that will never ever be revealed? 6. The second half of this story was a work of art even in it’s borderline mundanity. The way Donna Tartt showcased the fall of each and every one of the main characters was absolute perfection because really the story could have gone one of two ways: either they get caught or they don’t. The latter is the more interesting of the two outcomes and seeing how Bunny’s death slowly ruined all of their lives was just as satisfying as it was sad (yes, by the end of the book, I somehow came to care for this group of psychopaths).7. The TWIST that the twins took in the second-half of this story was insane. They seemed to be the most welcoming of the group in the beginning and then by the end, I just wanted Charles to take a really long walk over a very short pier. (I get it though, this was Donna Tartt showing us that something that looks so perfect on the outside can, in reality, be something disgusting and corrupt on the inside — genius.)8. JUSTICE FOR FRANCIS. This guy was not perfect, but out of all the characters I just want the best for him, and only him.9. RICHARD'S INTRUSIVE THOUGHT ABOUT CAMILLA MADE MY EYES POP OUT OF MY HEAD. Where in the holy hell did that come from?!Anyway... these are my initial thoughts about this book. Although, I can't seem to get it out of my head and whenever I think about it, I seem to have something new to say so I expect that I'll keep adding on to this mess of a review/list of rambling thoughts as time goes on. Donna Tartt, I may never read another one of your books, but hot damn, this was a good one. --- Original review below --- What did I just read? Why am I crying over the deranged characters that make up this book? I’m so confused. Somebody please explain to me what I should be feeling."

 this is the only story i will ever be able to tell 	i am a very character driven reader, and man, let me tell you - 'the secret history' has so many perfectly flawed, realistic and relatable characters that are easy to attach oneself to. tartt gives us so much background on each character that it seems like we've known them since they were in diapers. this group of terribly privileged and somewhat pretentious group of college students was easily my favorite part about reading this novel. for starters, henry winters is quite definitely the character i was drawn to the most (to me, he was like a mash-up of victor from 'vicious' and gansey from 'the raven cycle'). henry is one of those people that are good at everything they do, be it from growing flowers to learning languages and linguistics. anything you can think of; he can probably do it better than you. and despite that, he is not cocky in any way whatsoever. he's someone who, deep, deep down, really takes what others think about him to heart. he wants to be known for his kindness and his heart, rather than his seemingly limitless bank account and his extensive knowledge. henry's character was quite complex and had the most depth to him. after my beloved winters, i'd have to say that camilla macaulay is my second favorite character. when we first are introduced to her, we imagine this soft haired blonde angel of a girl (thanks for that, richard) who could seemingly do no wrong. however, camilla is honestly a queen. she's the only girl in this elite group of students, and yet she's able to handle her own much better than any of the other boys are. she stood up for herself when necessary, took absolutely no shit from anyone, and we later find that she isn't as innocent as she seems (well, none of them are but that's a story for another day). next in my favorites ranking is francis abernathy, who, in the beginning, i was somewhat indifferent about. he felt more like a comedic relief character to me, though i loved him all the same at the end. he's a very neutral character, too, i believe; which is why he isn't an absolute favorite or an absolute hated. no, that title would belong to none other than charles macaulay and bunny corcoran. for starters, i did like both of their characters in the beginning. however, the more i read, the more i started to hate bunny. he is my absolute least favorite and was just an absolute mess of a character who had no redeeming qualities whatsoever. i did feel bad for him at the end, but honestly...he got what he deserved. similarly, i felt bad for charles, too, but ultimately i was just upset with his development. or, i guess i should say i was upset by the enlightening that happened towards the end because up until that point i did really like him. other than these main five, i was also partial to their professor, julian, up until the end.  i prefer to think of it as redistribution of matter	now for the plot. going into 'the secret history', i had absolutely no idea what it was about other than the fact that it involved murder and was considered a cult classic in the dark academia genre. having read 'if we were villains’' and 'vicious', i've fallen pretty in-love with this genre and was eager to pick up the book that arguably started it all. the synopsis on the back of the book is so vague, and i really didn't want to read too much about this novel before i picked it up so i decided to jump into it partially blind. i'm still not too sure if that was the best decision, though i can't imagine what all i would have needed to know in order to prepare myself for this book. yes, i had expectations and no, none of them were met, but i wasn't even mad about it because the actual plot was a lot wilder than i ever could have imagined. like, a group of elite college students murders a former member of the said group for what? the aesthetic? honestly, it felt like that's why they did 85% of the things they did (which is totally relatable because i, too, do things for the aesthetic all the time). i can safely say the plot in this book was dramatic as hell, but also very inviting in a sense. there was also a mystery element thrown in which i greatly enjoyed. though not expected, i did end up loving the plot quite a bit. there was a lot of humor throughout, which, with a book as dark as this, was greatly appreciated.   no person, no matter how beloved, can ever truly understand us	in the end, i was left with a haunting feeling that still hovers around me when i think about this book. the ending was so abrupt but fitting that i'm still thinking about it and tearing up slightly. 'the secret history' was an interesting read that i would recommend to those who are fond of the wonderfully disturbing aspects of human reality, and to those who like reading about pompous and dramatic college students who seem to have no care in the world."

""Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it.""

 First and foremost, this book was in fact beautiful. I will not deny that about it, the way in which it was written with the detailing being so intricate and complex. However, I struggled with its length, the chapters were draining to me, I feel that could in retrospect convey the feeling in which we are meant to feel with this book. Though there were times I wanted to completely stop reading this book, I couldn't. It's like I was entranced by its own dazzling complexity. In truth, I had to look up a lot of things to understand the concepts of this book, which I do actually enjoy, but I feel for those who aren't English fans would really hate that. However, by doing a little digging and research into the metaphors, I was able to gain a better liking for this book. I do not love it and nor would I compare If We Were Villains to it. It was really its own entity and entirely different. 
 Here is my warning for any spoilers that may come ahead, please, turn around and advert your eyes, unless you want to hear my further thoughts on this, or do not care if you're about to be spoiled.
 We are centred around our main character and narrator, Richard Papen. Richard is what are the words to use, bland. He cannot seem to fathom beauty into his life, he feels almost morally grey.
""Does such a thing as 'the fatal flaw,' that showy dark crack running down the middle of a life, exist outside literature? I used to think it didn't. Now I think it does. And I think that mine is this: a morbid longing for the picturesque at all costs.""
 Richard has this obsession with beauty, it feels like its his own hamartia. Especially as we learn of course he comes from a poor background with a poor outlook on life and when he finds himself studying Greek, he finds the beauty within it and he wants to continue to grasp at it. Of course this projects his fascination towards the secretive group at Hampden Collage. In this fascination he wants to become a part of this thing he finds beautiful, yet, like the beginning quote states ""beauty is terror. . ."" , and unfortunately that is true. Especially with everything that plays out within this group of young adults that he winds up wrapped up in. We are introduced to the individuals who all play a crucial role for this novel and its center around Greek history and in of itself how they find themselves becoming a Greek history all on their own...(see what I did there? did you see? . . .I'll see myself out).
""After all, the appeal to stop being yourself, even for a little while, is very great' . . . 'to escape the cognitive mode of experience, to transcend the accident of one's moment of being.""
 They had become obsessed with the obsession to move beyond this ideals of this world. However, it ceased to truly happen when the five of them, excluding Richard, had taken it upon themselves to attempt one of their own rituals that the Greeks had. To be completely and utterly honest with you, Henry Winters, scared the living shit out of me. At first he seemed, quiet, brief, knowledgeable, but yet sweet. However, within his beauty, he was terror. He was the front ringer of everything that had unveiled itself to the group. He led them all down the supposed ""rabbit hole"" if you will and they were forever changed. Yet, the thing with all of them, is they were all sadistic and murderous villains. Edmund ""Bunny"" Corcoran, was a complete and utter jackass. Yet, the fact of the matter is the symbolism behind his nickname. The fact that Bunny is never called Edmund unless by Julien their professor is really quite interesting. Especially in his characterization. As rabbits were often given as a gift for abundance and as a love token. For Bunny, he enjoys indulging himself in divine and abundant riches that which he does not obtain himself, rather through Henry. Whom, he forces to pay into his lavish lifestyle. Bunny abuses this power he holds over them, and of course this projects his ultimate demise. 
""Once I hit a deer with my car. It was beautiful creature and to see it struggling, blood everywhere, legs broken . . . And this was even more distressing but at least I thought it was over.""
 The symbolism hidden within the relevance to them hitting the deer (which of course we learn was in fact not a deer), and as well as Henry's speech in describing the scene. A deer can reiterate to several ideals, being that of gentleness, caution, and power. It feels like they are that of a deer caught in the headlights and losing focus. Especially in that of what the ritual was meant to be and rather what it became. It alludes to their own realization of the crimes they committed and furthermore when they all willingly plan to kill Bunny.
""The woods were silent, not a sound' . . . 'why, looking for new ferns.""
 It's interesting the way in which they devised their plan, at first, it had been that of microdosing using various poisonous mushrooms. Which in of itself is also a hallucinogen, therefore making it feel as if this crime they are all about to willingly commit is not ""real"". However, of course this is changed, as it is not viable to Henry. They need to make it look ""accidental"". Therefore, we are left in the woods with the ""ferns"" being our last interaction between Bunny and the rest of the group. Ferns also have an interesting symbolism to them, usually meaning that of ""eternal youth"", which really corresponds to the idealism of beauty this novel portrays as well as how Bunny is now left in an ""eternal slumber"" if you will. As well it feels that Bunny continues to live on and haunt each of them individually for their injustice against him. Again, blackmailing beyond the grave. Of course we begin to see their spiral as truths are revealed to us. Particularly, within the twins, Camilla and Charles Macauley. Who reminded me heavily in regards to what is known as the Oedipus Complex and if you don't know what that is. It's gross. That's all I can say. As well as the way the Richard was entranced by Camilla, he expresses several times throughout the novel that he is in love with her and even proposes to her at the end. Yet, she cannot accept, as Henry, (who in theory was the reason for all of this and yet he kills himself as a self sacrifice in the end), she is still in love with and cannot fathom anything else. Which again sets up this feeling of did Richard really love Camilla? Or did he love the beauty she emitted? Even with Francis Abernathy, who is also intertwined with Charles. The way in which he loves him feels unattainable. Even his gesture to end everything and ask Henry the why of it all. Yet, he survives, which makes it feel like even he is unable to escape this disastrous life they created amongst themselves.This novel and its characters (who I found extremely unlikable for the most part), also felt very rigid, hardened like stone. Which to me feels like they themselves have become a statue, a moment in time where we reflect upon it and what it makes us feel and the deeper meaning behind its voiceless, yet timeless self.
""The dead appear to us in dreams,' . . . 'because that's the only way they can make us see them; what we see is only a projection, beamed from a great distance, light shining at us from a dead star. . .""
 This is one of the final quotes we receive from Richard's tellings of this long and dreary story, and it truly allows for this final sequence. The dead are that of a projection in the light in which we see them. They are something to bewilder and be uncertain of. They haunt us in a way in which we do and don't want to be, they are a beauty that is filled with terror, but yet, we can never look away until they dissipate and cease back into that of a memory.  Overall this book was a lot and I am both overwhelmed and underwhelmed by it. I truly can't say whether I loved or hated it. However, I can say it left an impact on me. I still feel uncertain of a rating, but I am going with what my gut is saying. But, on one final note, there is no book quite like this and it really is beautifully terrorizing.3.75/5"

 Alas, poor gentleman,He look’d not like the ruins of his youthBut like the ruins of those ruins.–JOHN FORD,The Broken Heart It is only later, in solitude, in memory, that the realization dawns: when the ashes are cold; when the mourners have departed; when one looks around and finds oneself—quite to one’s surprise—in an entirely different world.
To talk about this book is really not an easy task. First of all, you should understand that when I started it, I had absolutely different image in my head. I wanted to read it for a while and during that time, as our MC Richard pictured the group of five people and their professor as some kind of mysterious and divine creatures, I pictured this book in a similar fashion: an old university, elite students and secrets as thick as the ivy that surrounds the building of that university. Something out of a movie or out of a book (obviously). But what I found was of a different kind and depth. Old university - yes; elite students - yes; secrets - yes; but no conspiracies or out of imagination drama - all that happens in this story strongly resembles - is - a life in its truest and sometimes ugliest form. Also, you should understand that there's no likable characters. Every one of them, though wrong and mislead by imagination way stronger than their own, are not the kind of persons you can sympathize with. They do not get education to be fully engaged in social activities or to get a profession: what they get is a very narrow knowledge, the one that can only strengthen one's believe in their own superiority. But that is also not why I strongly dislike these characters; it is because they are cold and unfeeling in the ways that count the most. We know from the first pages that they've killed their classmate - a part of their closed circle - the only question is why and could those reasons be justified by murder?  What we did was terrible, but still I don’t think any of us were bad, exactly; chalk it up to weakness on my part, hubris on Henry’s, too much Greek prose composition—whatever you like.I won't divulge into explaining whys of my dislike, because it will require to evaluate some of the characters' actions, and we can't do that without revealing some of the important plot moves. You will have to draw your own picture on every one of them: six characters different in many ways, but similar in one - superiority and ignorance of reality, sometimes in a way that borders on cruelty and indifference.His students—if they were any mark of his tutelage—were imposing enough, and different as they all were they shared a certain coolness, a cruel, mannered charm which was not modern in the least but had a strange cold breath of the ancient world: they were magnificent creatures, such eyes, such hands, such looks—sic oculos, sic ille manus, sic ora ferehat.This book is highly philosophical: one of the main issues is the difference between classical mind and a modern one. How would ancient people act in a particular situation? Should me try to achieve their level of philosophy or the way of living? What drove them on and so on. We already know that the result of such pursuits will not end well. And in a way it's a story of crime and punishment: moral and physical, but don't be so ready to label it as another detective story with culprits and victims - it's way more than that. I also wouldn't say that this book is fast-paced, on the contrary, it's slow and languid; I would even cut a hundred of pages or so out of it with no regret, because sometimes it was too hard to swim through its waters of slowness and contemplation. Do not expect mind-blowing twists: things will surprise you, but it will happen gradually, and the premonition of something terrible will always follow you, so whatever turn the plot will take, won't be a total surprise to you.I would recommend this book. As it always happens with books that describe life in its different ways, you will always find something personal in it or something that will touch hidden strings of your soul. Such books make us really thinkabout roads and turns we make on our long way called life. Any action, in the fullness of time, sinks to nothingness. "

There’s all kinds of substances in this book, yet no substance in the writing itself. It’s so painfully shallow in the way Tartt flexes her academic knowledge by listing philosophers, thinkers, writers, schools of thoughts, great literary works etc and does nothing with them aside from creating a contrast between the characters' vast academic knowledge and their overall idiocy. This book is the definition of what a dark academia pinterest mood board would look like in words or what those people whose experience with intellectualism started and ended with some deep quote on instagram think intellectualism is.The plot itself is overstuffed yet the only two interesting things that happen on screen are the climax and an unexpected finding near the end. That’s it. Aside from the bizarre YA soap opera at the end, every major event happens off screen. Tartt’s writing formula goes like this: first, we’re being given painfully obvious hints of what our dumb mc doesn’t realize his equally dumb buds do behind his back, and then someone describes to us what happened. She does this with characters interactions too; Richard tells us a lot how much they all love Julian and how charismatic and enigmatic he is (btw the blurb on the back is a joke, these mfs don’t do nothing bc of their “charismatic” teacher’s ill fated influence, he barely is around, as a matter of fact) and we’re supposed to believe him bc we’re never shown why. The one time Tartt has the chance to make him relevant, she just writes him off.Speaking of irrelevant characters, the number one spot belongs to Richard. He isn’t just bland, he feels like he doesn’t exist; you could rewrite this novel in third person narration, cut him off entirely, and you wouldn’t feel like anything changed at all. His friends aren’t any better either. Camilla exists only to stir drama once Bunny is dead (not a spoiler, it’s in the prologue) and to serve as some kind of love interest even though she and Richard have no chemistry whatsoever - this right here is why fandoms are usually more interested with gay pairings than the straight ones, the chemistry of the latter is literally non-existent most of the time, yet authors keep pushing them down everyone’s throats, and Tartt is no exception; Francis is the very stereotypical gay token who wants to fuck his straight male buddies; Charles is yet another stereotypical degenerate bc of course he is, how else are you going to make twins interesting if you don't spice up their relationship with shock value tropes that nowadays work better in fanfiction for a reason; Henry is not exactly bland, but we never really get to properly understand him. Imo he would’ve made a better protagonist - practically he is the protagonist - but we’re stuck in Richard’s pov from start to finish.Last thing I want to mention is the random insertion of social awareness at some point; I’m not saying she’s wrong in her portrayal of racism, nor am saying bigotry is limited by borders, but it’s definitely an interesting choice to do that in a book which is mainly set in Vermont, one of the most progressive American states. Btw, unless they are part of the targeted groups - or the whole work revolves around it -, good writers usually manage to make powerful statements on social issues without using slurs. Tartt, unfortunately, isn’t one of them.DNF at 64% because this book is way too long and way too boring.I get what Tartt was trying to do here, I really do, but she kind of sabotaged herself when she diluted her story with lots and lots of unnecessary aesthetics that ultimately had no purpose whatsoever and a plot that had no reason to be this tediously paced."
207,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13080935-simon-fay,Rating 1 out of 5,"Tell me why I should finish this book.So far, the charismatic classics professor mentioned in the blurb has been aloof and barely present. The clever group of misfits who discover a new way of thinking, 'a world away from the humdrum existence of their contemporaries,' have been utterly lacking in any interesting qualities, and the new way of thinking they discover has barely been touched on other than with a very long and drawn out story that might as well have been summed up as, 'We discovered a new way of thinking. It was great.'Surely a book that puts Greek writing and philosophy at the forefront of its themes should offer some insight into Greek writing and philosophy. The characters are supposedly in love with it all, but aside from name dropping a bit of ancient literature every now and again, the book never even attempts to illustrate what exactly it is about the culture that drives them to such extremes.I can forgive the book for not living up to the premise marketing decided on. In fact, I am pretty sure the author's intention wasn't to achieve a book that features a kookie bunch of kids and their darkly compelling college professor. She probably meant to draw them as pretentious and unlikable and hoped to create a dry, acerbic tale that alluded to the banality of evil. Unfortunately for her, she was completely handicapped by bland writing, uninspired set pieces, and an ill conceived goal to reach a high wordcount. The lists, my god! She was only capable of describing things by listing out items that happened to populate any give room. Sure, evil is banal, but you're able to make an interesting piece of fiction out of it. Go watch a Coen Brothers movie.Anyway, I left the book at a friends house, so I have about 150 pages left to read. I don't tend to abandon books, but I'm very tempted to with this one. Can anybody give me a reason to finish it off?"
208,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56662187-emma,Rating 4 out of 5," The Secret History is haunting and beautiful. It will wreck your heart, and consume your thoughts long after you finished reading. Watching Richard Papen and his five friends spiral towards ruin, I felt the tragedy and fiery excitement of youth. These characters are incredibly morally gray. The first half of the book portrays their strengths of character and makes you love them. The second half shatters the view you'd built of them and makes you afraid of them. These are not the type of characters that you can completely love or hate. You feel both for them. They feel both for each other. Their relationships are a tangled mess of toxicity and sacrifice.  The writing also makes you pause every other page to think. I'm not sure I've ever read such a quotable book. I don't write in books, but this one had me itching to pick up a pen (I didn't). Donna Tartt also focussed on a view of college that's different from others. Yes, the drugs, drinking, and sex were there, but it reminded me more of an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel than anything else. In fact it reminded me a lot of Fitzgerald. The feeling of impending doom, and knowing that in the end the characters will not, cannot be happy. Speaking of the ending... (SPOILERS AHEAD------------------) I couldn't have imagined a better ending for their story. I kept wishing for some redemption, someone who was happy, (maybe Francis and Richard could have gotten married??) but it wouldn't have fit the story. The whole point was for them to end up where they did. It wasn't all hopeless though. I think Henry's sacrifice in the end was meant to remind us again of the ambiguity of these characters. Hubris is his fatal flaw, YET he's capable of love and sacrifice. Sure, you could say he did it for selfish reasons, but I choose to believe the opposite.  Overall I loved this book, but I won't be rereading it anytime soon because my emotions are still a mess. "

I probably read at least half of this and it just felt so long. I realized I should just DNF it because trying to make myself finish it felt like torture. I know this is beloved by so many but it was not for me at all. I think I like books inspired by TSH more than I like the original (i.e. If We Were Villains). I like the idea of an exclusive club and a close knit group of friends with secrets. But the pacing of this book *killed* me. There were a lot of time jumps where months would go by and things would just be summarized by the main character. I felt like I was watching these character through hazy vignettes and I wasn't allowed to know all the details. It was an extremely frustrating feeling. I know that most people love this book for the characters and the writing but it just did not do it for me. I DNF'd this before the murder even ended up happening. I'm not sure where this was exactly in the book but I listened to at least 12 hours of the audiobook before giving up. Booktube | Instagram | Twitter

But not that much ago to not remember what I was thinking then. When I started I was like: oh, dear me, it surely will be a five star book. About two hundred pages later my thinking was more like: hmm, well, it’s not that the book isn’t still good but there’s something not quite right about it. And finally, as one can see, I ended up with three stars. And it’s a really generous rating because I felt that I was only some pages from throwing it to the wall.I’m not sure what really happened and what had gone wrong. After promising, disturbingly ominous beginning, decent middle part such totally fucked up, long-winded second part of the book. But the worst of it, it was just deadly dull. I’ve lost totally my interest how it would end. I realized that didn’t care about this bunch of pompous snobs nor their so called charismatic teacher. I even double checked meaning of this word in dictionary because couldn’t notice any charisma in him. In one word: it’s all the same to me."
211,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75886236-parmyc-grimm-pitch,Rating 1 out of 5,"Every good review, in my opinion, needs a good start. A catchy headline is needed to make people go “hmm, so what next?” Or “wow, that sounds like a good critique.” Ladies and gentlemen, here’s my intellectually quick to impress headline for TSH: WHAT THE FUCK?The Secret History, undoubtedly, wins the “Most boring, uninteresting, overrated, totally not worth the hype, the writer had zero idea what she was talking about, what a waste of fucking time and money” Award of the year which is something, really. This book had no fucking plot besides killing off an annoying bitch and still, somehow, managed to be 700 pages long. I had never, in my professional reading life, came across a book that used so many words but actually said nothing. So, what the fuck even happened for 700 pages? | Characters: Stereotypes. Everyone’s obsessed with Henry Winter but you can’t be as obsessed with him as Donna Tartt was. The amount of energy she put describing this boy is beyond me. He was such a cliché i can’t even describe his features without laughing. Glasses! Suits! Dark and mysterious! Knows it all! Good at everything! Cold and intelligent! Moral compass currently on a vacation! Knows 78 languages because why not! Probably got a degree at age 12! Meanwhile all the others share one braincell all together, there’s not much to talk about really, a bunch of minions, by some standards they look good too, some are rich some are broke, one got temper issues,one is an absolute arse, one looks kinda fem, the supposed MC is not even worth having a bold feature, whatever man, Henry loves his coffee black, write that down. There’s also this one girl in their group, Camila, that is only ever sexualized and apparently has no other reason to exist besides being pretty so that Richard can drool over in any chance given. Everyone has slept with everyone. there’s no end to that. You can’t really connect with any of these bitches because they’re either too shallow or badly described that they don’t even feel like a real character. Richard, you can sometimes feel related to, but definitely not when he thought about RAPING Camila because what the actual fuck was that. The guy that gets murdered, y’all know who he is, is constantly characterized as a sexist, racist, homophobe, annoying piece of trash that you never even “like” him. So you don’t feel shit when he’s finally dead. (A good murder case, in my opinion, are the ones that they kill off someone you had a reason to like at least. in some cases even those you loved! That makes it way more interesting than killing someone everyone already hated. What happened to mixed feelings in murder mysteries, Donna?) Wrapping up this category, sometimes you can tolerate a bad plot for good-written characters. In this case, abandon hope all ye who enter here.| Plot: bitch, what plot? A group of fools kill another fool and that’s it. No sub-plots.No interesting turns of events. Nothing. It’s not even about the Latin classes you were promised it’ll be about! Richard was like “Yeah there’s this class that everyone looks interesting in it and they study Latin. I really wanna know what happens in those classes! What are they learning about?!?!?! Okay so i entered the classes now! I’m one of them! *fuck everything that happens in it i ain’t gonna speak about what makes this class and the professor so special you’re not gonna get any context here* so anyway we killed our mutual friend.” So no, you’re not gonna know anything about those classes beside that “What is beauty? Terror” shit that used to be a thing for a while on Dark Academia boards. But!!!! You’re gonna read about the boy’s funeral for 19 fucking pages!!! Details!!! Of all the grandkids and great grandparents!!! So important and worth reading about!! At some point, i started taking notes, making a list of all the sub-plots that were worth mentioning, and believe it or not, i ended up listing out 16 sub-plots only! 16 sub-plots for a 700 pages book! How is that even possible??? I am speechless in a George Costanza way.For me, this book felt like something Donna Tartt was trying to prove to the world. Everytime i was reading it, i couldn’t shake the feeling that she’s only trying to use hard-to-pronounce words to show the audience how well-educated she is. Because unfortunately, as beautiful as those words were, they had nothing more to offer. No plot, no actual story, nothing to make me like this book. You read about it online and think “hmm. This sounds intense.” But when you actually read the book, you’ll realize that was all it was. An intense looking illusion. I’m sorry but no one can convince me that this book had something deeper in it than what i just said. Point proven Donna, you’re smarter than those you hated back at college now. ( Also, Persian and Arabic are two different languages. If you’re so into this, you ought to know it.)"

I went to college several thousand miles from where I lived, so I remember pausing and reflecting on this paragraph.“The idea of living there, of not having to go back ever again to asphalt and shopping malls and modular furniture; of living there with Charles and Camilla and Henry and Francis and maybe even Bunny; of no one marrying or going home or getting a job in a town a thousand miles away or doing any of the traitorous things friends do after college; of everything remaining exactly as it was, that instant – the idea was so truly heavenly that I’m not sure I thought, even then, it could ever really happen, but I like to believe I did.”Donna Tartt - The Secret History"
213,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21700817-cyra,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book was bad. I’m only giving it 3 stars because it got me hooked on the first portion of the book, then it went downhill. Before I get into detail, I’d like to talk about the very reason why you should NOT read this book: Richard. (TW for his paragraph: Mention of abuse & rape.) At some point in the book, Camilla goes over to Richard and talks about how Charles was abusing her. (He ripped a good chunk of her hair, gave her a bruised wrist & put out a cigarette on her arm which looked pretty bad. Even though it’s not mentioned, I am sure there was more.) Right after this conversation, Richard had this ""irresistible desire"" to rape Camilla. I'm not even exaggerating. Here's the quote: ""I felt a fierce, nearly irresistible desire to seize Camilla by her bruised wrist, twist her arm behind her back until she cried out, throw her on my bed: strangle her, rape her, I don’t know what.” The 'bruised wrist' which was the result of a very recent abuse, yes. He, our protagonist who was supposed to be at least an okay guy, has thoughts like this. ELECTRIC CHAIR.Also, Camilla ran away from her house because Charles was beating the shit out of her and she openly talked about this but Richard was obsessed with sending her back home because Charles was sad? SAD? (Add sparkle emoji here.) And this book had the audacity to make us think Bunny was the villain when Richard is an abuse supporter and someone who thinks about raping the woman he claims he loves. Now back to my normally planned review: Let’s start with Bunny who was the only good part of the book because he, to some extent, made me feel something. (If he was slightly, just a little bit likable, the story would be more effective though.) Bunny was the most despicable, annoying little piece of shit, I had the misfortune to read about. By the time he died, I was so done with him that I CHEERED. And I went absolute bonkers when they felt bad about his death, he deserved it and worse. (These were my thoughts before I saw the real Richard.)Camilla had literally no layers. She had the personality of a doorknob. (I know it sounds stupid but if you read the book, you’ll somehow agree.) She was just there to be sexualized and be obsessed over by Richard. (They didn’t even have chemistry. They were the embodiment of the ‘standing man emoji’ when they were together.) I honestly can't believe Camilla was written by a FREAKING WOMAN. Disgraceful. Julian, their teacher, who had a big influence on the group was absent for most of the story. He was like a decoy when he should’ve been way more important. He wasn’t a mentor nor an important person. We were told he and Henry had a close relationship but like, where? Lastly, I’d like to talk about how unreasonably long this book was. It could’ve been shorter very easily. Some would say it’s the style of the author, I’d say it’s boring as fuck. The writing was not bad but the drag of the plot and unnecessary details pushed my limits.When I started this I really had high hopes, after all this book was the birth of ‘dark academia’ but I was highly disappointed."
214,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5512657-sara,Rating 4 out of 5,"Bunny Corcoran is dead, and Richard Papen, his friend, participated in his murder. That’s not a give-away, we are told that on page one. But walking through it all was one thing; walking away, unfortunately, has proved to be quite another, and though once I thought I had left that ravine forever on an April afternoon long ago, now I am not so sure.For me, that was the hook. The first half of this book held me enthralled and wanting to know the why and wherefore. The tension built beautifully, and the character development was clever and complete. Bunny was an unpleasant person, a bit of a cad, and it was hard to feel any overwhelming sorrow at the prospect of his death, but then there was so much we did not know. So much Richard, indeed, did not know, and we were relying on him to give us the facts. As the story progressed, my point of view changed and with it my opinion of these “kids”. The amount of alcohol alone should have killed them. As the story progressed, I wondered why Richard wanted to involve himself with such a seedy group. The camera kept changing angles and showing me bits and pieces I had failed to see before. I began to wonder whether there was a moral code at work here at all; I began to examine the lives they had lived before college, and to see how their parents, teachers and guardians had shaped or failed to bother to shape them. The second half of the novel did not live up to the first half for me. It went on too long and revealed too little. I recognized shades of Crime and Punishment, which was obviously intentional, since some time after noting that, there appeared a quote directly from that work in the mouths of one of the characters. The psychology of the characters was paramount, but there was much of the mindset that I never clearly understood. I was left with unanswered questions.My hat is off to Donna Tartt for the scope of what she attempts here. It is a debut novel, after all. It falls short of The Goldfinch, but it does accomplish most of what it sets out to do. There was still something intangible, something elusive, that kept it from being fantastic to me, something vaguely inconsistent about the characters that bothered me at times, even in light of the unreliable narrator. At the end of Book One, I felt I was headed for 5-stars, by three quarters in, I knew it would not be that. I am glad to have read it and I think Tartt is a strong writer and will not hesitate to read her again."

Εκεί, υπό την επιρροή του χαρισματικού καθηγητή Τζούλιαν Μόροου, που επίτηδες τον απομονώνει, όπως και τους υπόλοιπους πέντε φοιτητές του, από την λοιπή ακαδημαϊκή κοινότητα του Κολεγίου Χάμπτεν, εμπλέκεται, άμεσα ή έμμεσα, σε μια σειρά φρικτών γεγονότων που οδηγούν εν τέλει στην αναπόφευκτη κατακλείδα: την δολοφονία του φίλου και συμφοιτητή του Έντουαρντ –Μπάνι– Κόρκεραν, από τον ίδιο και τους άλλους τέσσερις επίλεκτους της ομάδας του Τζούλιαν Μόροου.Με όλη την ένταση της αριστουργηματικής της γραφής, που αν και δεν δυσκολεύει στην ανάγνωση είναι εμφανές πως έχει προκύψει μέσα από μεγάλη αφοσίωση και επιμέλεια, η Ντόνα Ταρτ αφηγείται μια εντυπωσιακή ιστορία που δίνει την αίσθηση, ακριβώς λόγω αυτού του εκρηκτικού συναισθηματικού της πλούτου, μιας ειλικρινούς ημερολογιακής καταχώρησης. Ο εξομολογητικός τόνος του αφηγητή, η μετάνοια και η μελαγχολία του, ο τρόπος που εμμέσως κατηγορεί τον εαυτό του για την εμπιστοσύνη που έδειξε σ’ εκείνον που ανέλαβε τα ηνία για την εκτέλεση του σχεδίου της δολοφονίας, είναι τόσο απανταχού παρόντα, τόσο αισθητά στις σελίδες και τόσο αληθινά, ώστε το κείμενο στο τέλος εντυπώνεται όχι απλώς ως λογοτεχνικό έργο, αλλά ως συγκεκαλυμμένη ομολογία.Αν και το κεντρικό σημείο της αφήγησης είναι η δολοφονία του Μπάνι, η ίδια η πράξη περιγράφεται, στην ουσία, κάπως παρασκηνιακά. Η Ταρτ δεν ενδιαφέρεται τόσο για το έγκλημα όσο για τον λόγο για τον οποίο διεπράχθη, με αποτέλεσμα το μυστήριο εδώ να μην είναι το ποιος, αλλά το γιατί. Και παρόλο που οι σελίδες είναι πολλές, παρόλο που γνωρίζουμε τι συνέβη και ποιος το έκανε από την αρχή και παρόλο που η αφετηρία της αφήγησης είναι το μηδέν –με τον Ρίτσαρντ πρώτα να εξιστορεί το απώτερο παρελθόν του–, το ενδιαφέρον διατηρείται σταθερά ακόμη και μετά τις εξηγήσεις, μετά την πράξη, μετά τις αντιδράσεις, έως τον αντίκτυπο που είχαν στους εμπλεκόμενους και που αποκτά χαρακτήρα στο τελευταίο κεφάλαιο του βιβλίου.Η Μυστική Ιστορία είναι, εν πολλοίς, ένα πολύ δυνατό, πολύ ιδιαίτερο, πολύ προσωπικό μυθιστόρημα. Μου φάνηκε πως διαβάζοντας συμμετείχα σχεδόν βιωματικά, ορισμένες σκέψεις και ορισμένα συναισθήματα που δεν ήξερα πριν πώς να τα ορίσω πήραν εύκολα σάρκα και οστά μέσα από τις σελίδες, κι έμεινα στο τέλος μ' ένα μούδιασμα, μια μελαγχολία και την αίσθηση πως τόσο το κείμενο όσο και οι χαρακτήρες του θα μου λείψουν.

I put off reading The Secret History FOR YEEEEAAAAAARS because I was afraid I would hate it in comparison to The Goldfinch (which surprised no one more than my own self when I loved every single word of it). As someone who tends to guess the whodunit in supposedly “never saw it coming!” releases, let me tell you there is nothing more tasty than a big ol’ helping of knowing immediately who the killer is. Donna Tartt is freaking magical. It’s like she had a professor at one point who told her that her writing was pretentious and from that point on she was all “hold my beer” and somehow she makes it work. Notes to myself are also of the highbrow variety such as “ooooh so olde timey – me likey” and “I is gonna be smort after reading this one.” Nailed it! Now maybe I can tackle The Little Friend."

I used to think it didn't. Now I think it does. And I think that mine is this: a morbid longing for the picturesque at all costs.""Richard, a college student from California, has arrived on an elite New England college campus, determined to continue his study of the classics and leave his failed attempt at medical school behind. He is soon drawn up into an unlikely group of disgustingly wealthy, self-consciously clever, and blazé students, just as obsessed with Ancient Greek as he, and all entranced by their kind yet mysterious professor and mentor.What follows is an unravelling, a spreading darkness: obsession, envy, and a tendency toward the brutal and dramatic. What follows is murder.The Secret History is viewed, by many, as the modern birth of Dark Academia, and it certainly delivers on both darkness and the academe in spades.Richard, our protagonist, is a compulsive liar, weighed down by ennui and disdainful of just about everything and everyone around him.Francis, Henry, Bunny, and the twins are all battling their own demons; addictions, hatred, secret trysts, a craving for blood.These are not your typical college students, and this story is not your typical mystery.The characters in this novel were its highlight, immoral and insufferable and yet somehow sympathetic and charming. Their complexity and richness of development drew me in and made me care, even while hating them (which I did, entirely and at every moment of the 500+ pages of this novel).The writing is beautiful and often lyrical, the pacing is quick and engaging, and the story itself plays out like a piece of classic tragic theatre, leaving your heart aching as you observe the mess of wasted lives at your feet, lost due to unimaginable choices that were also, somehow, inevitable. Simply the culmination of a fatal flaw. This book is deeply pretentious but in a self-aware campy way that pokes fun at itself and revels in the ridiculousness of it all.""It's a very Greek idea, and a very profound one. Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it...

La loro è una continua ricerca della bellezza e del piacere, un tentativo di venire inglobati dai libri di testo e vivere indietro nel tempo.Qualcosa di tremendo accade però una di quelle notti fatte di alcol, eccessi, droghe e baccanali. “È un’idea tipica dei greci, e molto profonda. Bellezza è terrore. Ciò che chiamiamo bello ci fa tremare. E cosa potrebbe essere più terrificante e più bello che perdere ogni controllo?”.Questo romanzo gioca con la nostra mente e in un qualche modo perverso anche noi veniamo trascinati in quella malia, quell’illusione.

This time I listened, and found sitting down and immersing myself in the reading was more enjoyable. This is such an epic novel and listening frequently allows for distractions which cannot be afforded to fully appreciate and absorb the essence of 'The Secret History.' Donna Tartt narrates this herself, and she is absolutely fabulous in this role. Too often, authors should not touch the narration and leave it to the pros. However, Ms. Tartt has the narrative skills to rival the best of professionals. Her voice takes on many various forms with seamlessness and made all the difference (for me) as a listener and huge fan of this wonderful and timeless novel. An undeniably beautiful listen."

234,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan,Rating 5 out of 5,"4 ½ starsI actually almost gave this novel only 4 stars, but how the heck could I not give 5 stars to a book that got me to care so much for these characters and at times to even root for them?! Also, I’ve never read a story quite like this one.After reading The Goldfinch and now this book I have to say that I am inordinately curious about the author, especially about her childhood, adolescence, and young adult years. I’d love to have a conversation with her, about her books and also about life in general. I’m impressed with her ability to think up and write such unique books, and she’s a fine writer. By the time I got to about 100 pages from the end of this book, I wanted to immediately reread it, already knowing the entire scope of the story and its characters. However; I have my next 4 books waiting with time constraints and there are just too many other books I want to read, including the books I tend to occasionally reread. The book is very long, with much longer chapters than I prefer. One chapter was nearly 100 pages long. Overall, I found it to be a quick read. For me it dragged only for a brief time, somewhere in the middle. The book really changes course, not just with plot and characters but even re type of genre. It started as a sort of pretentious, heavy duty Greek philosophy tome, or at least I thought so, and I was afraid it would remind me too much of being back in certain English literature courses and I might get bored or irritated. I ended up loving that part. Then it turned into what I at first thought was a rather ordinary if smart mystery post mystery and (not true) crime story. I ended up liking that part too. Peculiar story. Peculiar characters; they’re fascinating. Given the subject, the story is surprisingly touching and full of humor. The narrator character is engaging and interesting and tells a great story.I think it’s ideal to start the book knowing very little. I thought I knew more than I did, as I was mistaken about the details of one thing I thought would happen. That was fine with me. Throughout there are perspicacious and entertaining observations about a variety of things including academia, intellectuals, families and family backgrounds and family secrets, new and old money, class, voyeurs of true crime, police work, drug & alcohol abuse and education, personas, appearances, friendship, mentorship, various cultural things, and the human condition. Warped sense of humor that I have, I laughed a lot. I hope that what I found humorous is what the author intended. Great first sentence!: “The snow in the mountains was melting and Bunny had been dead for several weeks before we came to understand the gravity of our situation.”I love how in the Epilogue when the reader is told what happens to many of the characters a minor cat character is included. I got a kick out of that. Quotes that I liked:“After all, the appeal to stop being yourself, even for a little while, is very great”“It was like waking from a nightmare to a worse nightmare.” Some big spoilers:  I wondered all along about Henry’s head injury and if it could have contributed to his psychopathy. I think it must have, yet all of them were a bunch of sociopaths. I actually thought in a way that Bunny was the biggest psychopath of the bunch, and at times wanted to kill him myself. He has only a very thin veneer of charm, never caring about anyone other than himself, caring only about how he can use people, and not just by getting Henry to pay for his expenses and even before he starts his blackmail, and he’s definitely the most cruelly sadistic to others, with a knack for it, common among sociopaths.I was surprised to find out what I did about the twins. Perhaps I’m dense and it should have been obvious. I partially understand but I wish could understand more fully the motivations of the narrator character. Yes, they were all unappealing and frightful people, yet I cared about them and cared what would happen to them. So in my opinion the author is brilliant!I started reading misinformed. I thought that they all, Richard included, had killed their classics teacher. I was fine with being wrong and would have liked to go in even more ignorant than I was, easier to do when reading books when they’re brand new. The first sentence did give me a clue right away, but I still knew nothing about the first death. That was weird but after mulling it over, I could sort of believe how it could happen given these people and their circumstances. "

So this book starts with Richard telling us that they killed Bunny. YOU GO BACK TO THE TIME HE WAS BORN (was it freaking necessary????????????? NO NO IT WAS NOT ) and then he tells you how he met his five classmates  murdermates  and how it led to them killing Bunny. ""Hey that doesn't sound too bad........ you might say"" EXCEPT THE SYNOPSIS IS THE ENTIRE STORY ALMOST ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENS AND THE THINGS THAT DO HAPPEN I COULD NAME IN LIKE TWO SENTENCES  Henry killed a farmer during a ritual, Buddy found out, blackmailed him and he decided to kill him. Henry in the end dies because he wants to blood sac himself  And the reason for killing Bunny was so underwhelming half of this book took in building it up and everything was so disappointing and so many things were just left handing  who the hell was that mysterious german man following them around in Italy??? I DON'T KNOW  THIS WAS THE MOST BORING BOOK I'VE READ IN MY LIFE AND I FEEL UTTERLY STUPID FOR SAYING THAT Also I do understand that the book was one of those ""no plot, just vibes"" books but the NO PLOT PART IS A  A LITTLE BIT  OF AN EXAGGERATION, right??RIGHT??? A book has to have a plot of some sort, this almost did not  Setting  But thankfully, the only thing keeping me from rating this 1 star is the setting. (Also the ending, I did like the ending  maybe because this finally ended I don't know  I LOVED THE SETTING IT WAS SO MELANCHOLIC and so depressing and just so weird and extremely dark academia. Characters Which brings me to my next point, this book had a huge contribution to the dark academia genre and as a nerd for that aesthetic, I wanted to love this but apart from the setting everything was blanddddd as heckkk The characters were all annoying, bland, boring, uninteresting, everybody was sleeping with everyone, everyone was constantly on drinks I realize that ok? I realize it's supposed to be that way but they are extremely bland and flat, NONE of them felt 3d. The characters don't have to be likable, they just have to be interesting which they were not. The main character I will not talk about cuz I kind of get why he is so boring and the fact that he's narrating this just makes him fade, I get that but the side characters were not it. Henry was the only one I liked a tiny bit Writing The writing was fine I guess, I liked the way it was written. The ending felt kinda beautiful?? The way the tragic things were being described, I can't deny that this book was in fact beautiful. Conclusion In conclusion, I hated this book because nothing really happened and the characters were extremely uninteresting. I did love the writing and how beautiful tragedy was portrayed and the setting felt amazing. If you like classics, maybe you would love this.  Please don't call be illiterate for not understanding the ArT of this book, thank you Thank you for putting up with this stupid review, I appreciate you putting up with me being annoying as usual.

237,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"This 1992 debut was more of an acquired taste than Donna Tartt’s 2014 Pulitzer winner The Goldfinch. The book was essentially a university campus murder mystery. The victim and the perpetrators were clearly spelt out in the prologue, and we got the hint that the killers might have managed to get away. The book proceeded to let the reader in, gradually, on the “why” and the lasting impact on those involved. The narrator Richard was an unfortunate son of a dysfunctional California family living a subsistence lifestyle. Longing for glamor and being stuck in harsh reality, Richard through sheer luck got admitted to a small elite university in Vermont. Another stroke of luck had him included in an intimate classic Greek program with one charismatic and ostensibly caring professor Julian, and five fellow classmates, all of them bohemians smart in their own ways, and two had significant discretionary financial resources to support the group. The close-net group lived in a cocoon, shunning the outside world, and Richard was slowly allowed in, at least it appeared so. However, it was what Richard was not privy first led to the crime, and Richard was sucked in, not entirely at well. All the main characters in the small closed group were well developed. None of them was perfect, or even likeable, but each was distinct and memorable. From a cool-headed, bookish, resourceful de fecto leader, to a seemingly innocuous but conniving leech. Richard’s evolvement and awakening was in the foreground, while no one else was what they were initially seen.Tartt executed the inverted detective structure well. From the very beginning she took the readers on a captivating journey of discovery. At each phase, i.e. before, during and after the murder, we were made aware by in large what to uncover, and yet incapable to foresee the road ahead. With the increasing tension looming over us, we were sucked deeper into the whirlwind, and found ourselves lost in conflicting impressions, and struggling to trust anyone. The pacing at some parts were a bit slow. For example, the drawn-out discussions on classic Greek and roman philosophies deserted my attention after a while, although there were plenty of good quotes. The ten-day manhunt could also be compressed. Actually selective shortening, at least taking out some drinking and doping, would make the book much more compelling. That said, Tartt’s sharp and flowing prose carried me easily through even the slowest parts.This book was solid as a debut, although I admit The Goldfinch was better—a dozen years certainly made a difference."

I loved watching the infamous group develop, and Henry's mystique grow and then seeing it all crumble. I’m well aware that idolising his dark sort of melodrama would be missing Tartt’s point, but I absolutely adored him. I think Henry Winter might just be one of my favourite characters ever.All the characters were unique and unforgettable in their own odd ways; and as a result, I was almost immediately invested in their fates. I loved Frances, Henry and Camilla, though I couldn't quite tell you why. They're living proof that the people we rely on who we built our society with are proved to be unreliable at best; scarred, immoral degenerates at worst. Tartt chronicles, very poetically, how easy it is to lose ourselves, and to justify evil. I loved the dark, contemplative tone, and the lavish prose made it almost feel like a classic—though I think it’s already well-deserving of the accolade modern classic. I couldn't put it down. Physically, I’m here, but mentally I’m in a doomed group of pretentious misfits at an elite Vermont college studying Greek poetry and attempting to eclipse the ideals of the contemporary world."

243,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44450617-eva,Rating 2 out of 5,"✦✦✧✧✧ ½ | it was average | rounded down because I was BOREDBurn all my certificates. Throw every qualification I have ever earned out of the window. My biggest achievement in this life is finishing this book and not skipping a single word. Let's see who ignores THAT resume.The Secret History by Donna Tartt is a book. Now that it is finally over I can sit down and ruminate. What did I gain? Of course, not all books must offer some great enlightenment, but from a book dubbed a ""tour-de-force"" and ""eye-opening"", I can say I expected as much. I didn't receive as much, in my honest, humble, and frankly quite uninformed BUT GREEK opinion. /sSo many people in my private life have suggested this book. The thing is, I'm Greek. So naturally, in everyone's mind, I must LOVE this book and it is unacceptable not to do so. Turns out, the only thing my ethnicity offered to this reading experience was unsolicited eye-rolls during those Greek lessons and utter confusion when a bunch of characters LITERALLY saw Dionysus before them. If anything, reading this in Greek made it so much worse, but we'll get to that. The Good WritingI reckon this was the saving grace of this book. I honestly can't say much for it since I read a translation, but from what I gathered the writing is great, very descriptive — if not too descriptive — and captivating. But THE RAMBLING. Oh, God. Whenever these characters went on another damn vacation I knew deep down that we were going to get dozens upon dozens of pages describing literally the most useless scenes and experiences. I guess that enforces the casual aspect of the writing style, but  jesus, who told you we want to read a fourty-page report on what every single character is doing at any given moment? I don't care if Henry is out smoking. A sentence would be enough, but nooooo, we get three pages about it. Pity us, Tartt, pity us.When they embarked on their way to the funeral, I knew there was another fucking road trip coming up and I just — I almost dropped it. True story.The AWFUL TranslationI will obviously not take this into account, but the translated book I read was damn awful. If any other Greek has read this (the 1992 publication) please tell me I'm not crazy. There were random italicized words everywhere — ""Richard, do you want coffee?"" —, the word choice was criminal, and there was actual legitimate slang in there. I so regret wanting to brush up on my native language, I really do.The ""Plot"" That Didn't Really ExistOkay, crucify me. THERE WAS NO PLOT. You want me to summarize literally everything that happens? Richard enters the lessons. They go on vacation to Francis's house. Bunny is a little bitch. Weird cult shit is happening. They kill a guy. They go on winter vacation. They kill Bunny. They go to Bunny's funeral. Henry dies. Richard graduates. Roll the curtains.  Honestly I expected so much more from a highly acclaimed 600-page book. This could easily be a 200-page novella, I swear to God, but as mentioned before the rambling really bumped that number up. The thing is, although the major plot points were mildly interesting, they were dilated by so much useless information that all interest was lost.Furthermore, there were so many actually needless scenes. Like that time Camila cuts her leg? Or that time  Francis  hits on  Richard  and then denies attraction for the other party and then we forget about all that? I feel there was some kind of hidden symbolism in those scenes that my peasant brain didn't understand. But now I feel robbed. All these moments now seem like blatant page fillers. The Character(s) Have you ever eaten dry, unseasoned chicken? That was the taste this cast gave me. The only interesting characters are Bunny and Henry, and they are both assholes. The author tried to give Francis a personality by doing you-know-what, aka applying the magic recipe for diversity, but imo failed. The problem is that when the characters are introduced their personalities are announced; they never prove those characteristics with their actions. They are all drunks and idiots and pagans. I see no difference, and frankly, Tartt made no attempt to show it instead of straight-up telling it. The Redundancy Of It All Prepare to have an existential crisis. When I put this book down, as mentioned before, I thought; ""What did I gain from reading this?"" As someone who primarily reads for entertainment, I was not entertained, so this is already two stars down. I lost sleep to get through it, I scoffed, I got sore eyes, but did I really earn anything valuable? Then I fell into the endless rabbit hole of 'why do we read at all?' and cried in the shower. It was fun.But seriously, I didn't quite make out the themes this book was trying to imply. It was something like Heathers but ten years later and in a cult, I suppose; it really emphasized how Bunny was absolutely despised when alive but worshipped when dead. I also appreciate how it was revealed Henry wasn't a good guy at all, after all, because Richard couldn't figure it out for himself. Upbringing, manipulation, the 𝓅𝑜𝓌𝑒𝓇 𝑜𝒻 𝒻𝓇𝒾𝑒𝓃𝒹𝓈𝒽𝒾𝓅 and other such themes are confronted, but nothing unique or at least remotely interesting.The final third of this book seemed so redundant. After Bunny's funeral what more is there to say, really? But let me tell you — I was AVENGED. The Weirdly Satisfying Conclusion It was great.  Henry  dying was so fitting; he was a huge manipulator and self-proclaimed psychopath, but I still didn't see it coming. I really appreciate how Tartt used the casual writing here, too. He just dies, he falls on the floor and that's it. Nothing too lyrical, because he doesn't deserve it. Overall This book is overhyped. There, I SAID IT. I honestly don't see why this is a ""modern classic"" but again, this is just my opinion. Maybe my desperation to get this over with blinded my judgment. But I am telling you; I have never DNFed a book and this time I got scarily close to doing so."
244,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39589830-zala,Rating 2 out of 5,"I'm a few decades late to the party, but that's alright since I was only reading this as context for Babel anyway.The first thing I noticed about The Secret History was its title; I don't know if it's an intentional nod to Procopius' The Secret History but, considering the author's background in classical literature, wouldn't be surprised if it was. I listened to the audiobook narrated by the author, so I can't say whether I would have enjoyed this more or less had I read it in physical form. I can say, however, that I liked the different voices she gave to the characters, but it also exposed her bad Latin pronunciation (a strong blow when you're trying to sell believable classics nerds).As for the story itself, I have to admit I enjoyed the first third of the book immensely - it was atmospheric, and I liked the slow build-up to the inevitable murder. That is where I started to have some doubts about the whydunit aspect of the story, though. You're telling me that four nerds who idolize the ancient Greeks/Romans and try to emulate certain practices (down to the incest, hubris, animal sacrifice, prophesies, and so on) would hang out with someone who is as blatantly homophobic and puritan as Bunny? Why on earth would they include him in the Bacchanalia reenactment?? And, on that note, why on earth would someone write about a murder they committed in their diary?The way the other characters chose to handle Bunny's knowledge of what they did was flat-out stupid, but I would have still enjoyed the rest of the book had it not been for one huge issue. The murder happens, the aftermath is explored, and Bunny is found, and yet the story just keeps on going and going. There were a few more interesting moments after the murder, and I didn't mind the ending, but this story didn't need almost 600 pages to be told (I've seen some pretty interesting fan theories on what Richard could have lied about, but the unreliable narrator aspect, while interesting, doesn't make up for the absolute tedium that was at least a third of this book). And what was up with the fictional Arab country? A rather pointless inclusion of even more racism. 2.5 stars"

I used to think it didn’t. Now I think it does. And I think that mine is this: a morbid longing for the picturesque at all costs.”  One of those murder-mystery-on-campus novels I plan on rereading for the sheer joy of uncovering all the breadcrumbs the author left for us, which I must have missed the first time around, then simply enjoy the genuine talks of Greek philosophy, history, and notions of beauty, as I paid little attention to this aspect of the book, having been focused more on the drama and its characters. Speaking of characters, I realized halfway through that that I should have looked at Julian more closely, the eccentric, yet morally fraudulent master of ceremonies, and his role in the story.Oh, and since my rating doesn’t scream loud enough: I absolutely loved 
The Secret History

252,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57003346-matthew-ted,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Secret History has the pleasure of being my 100th book of 2019. Milestone time, woop.Now, I have a lot to say, so I'm going to try and organise my thoughts in the best way possible; I know now that I will undoubtedly fail. I may begin with Tartt herself. I painstakingly transcribed this from a 1992 interview, rewinding and rewinding as I tried to type and keep up with her surprisingly, but oddly charming, Mississippi accent. She's talking about where The Secret History started.'The very first step in a way was deciding to reveal the murderer on the first page,' here, the interviewer interrupts (he's rather annoying), but Tartt, eventually, continues: 'one of the reasons I why I wanted to do that, it was partly because I'd been studying Greek and, you know, there's tremendous suspense, and in The Iliad you know everything that's going to happen, they tell you everything's going to happen in the first six lines and I mean this was just a very interesting question to me, how do you create suspense from knowing what we already know? And then, it was funny, I love Alfred Hitchcock and I read something that Alfred Hitchcock said, he said suspense doesn't come from having a bomb thrown from nowhere, you know, at the hero, suspense comes from having, you know, two people sitting, talking, at a table and there's a bomb ticking underneath the table and the audience sees it but the characters don't, and that's what suspense is.'This book is long, it's just shy of Moby Dick's word count, in fact, and I suppose in reality, it didn't have to be this long. It could have been shorter. Yet, I've heard people talk about 'control' when referring to Tartt's writing and it's absolutely right. Every scene, every piece of dialogue is building, in a minute, microscopic, way towards her end goal. I thought the characters were wonderful, not as people, but as constructions. Tartt writes with such movement, they are always doing something, smoking, slouching, moving their hands, she writes characters so well and animated. I was at a talk once and they said, paraphrased, 'New writers always fall into the trap of writing about photographs early on in their stories because they are static, easy to describe, they underestimate how hard it is to get characters moving and doing things.' That's right, certainly, I've remembered it for several years. Tartt has no trouble with it, though.So, we are told who is murdered and who is the murderer on the first page. Then we are taken on an almost 200,000 word plot. The characters, Richard, our first person protagonist, Henry, Bunny, Francis and the twins, Charles and Camilla. They study Greek; they are the only ones in this little elite class. The first portion of the book is normal, it doesn't get caught up in being a 'murder mystery', it's reminiscent of Bret Easton Ellis' work (of course, him and Tartt were friends, part of the Literary Brat Pack and in fact, The Secret History is dedicated to Ellis), the characters smoke, read, talk, go for dinners and get drunk. It takes a turn, naturally, towards murder and the building suspense, but it's well balanced, I think.Finally, some quotes to showcase some of Tartt's wonderful writing. It's controlled, I can agree with that word now, powerful and descriptive, but not over the top, which is surprising considering the length of the book. I won't write all the lovely Greek quotes, the Plato, the Aristotle, because then I may as well be reviewing them, or The Odyssey, or The Iliad. 'Everything was faded and silent in the dawn - dirty teacups, unmade bed, snowflakes floating past the window with an airy, dangerous calm. My ears rang. When I turned back to my work, with trembling, ink-stained hands, the scratch of my pen on the paper rasped loud in the stillness. I thought of Bunny's dark room and of the ravine, miles away; of all those layers of silence on silence.' 'White sky. Trees fading at the skyline, the mountains gone. My hands dangled from the cuffs of my jacket as if they weren't my own. I never got used to the way the horizon there could just erase itself and leave you marooned, adrift, in an incomplete dreamscape that was like a sketch for the world you knew - the outline of a single tree standing in for a grove, lamp-posts and chimneys floating up out of context before the surrounding canvas was filled in- an amnesia-land, a kind of skewed heaven where the old landmarks were recognisable but spaced too far apart, and disarranged, and made terrible by the emptiness around them.'In honesty, I could keep on quoting but I won't, I'm anxious the review will go on too long. However, this quote is said fairly early on, and quite apt for the book, maybe:'Any action, in the fullness of time, sinks to nothingness.'"
253,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51227238-fifi,Rating 4 out of 5,"From the very first page this book had me hooked. Tartt’s writing is absorbing and expects a level of involvement on part of the reader. It starts off with many references to characters and actions you’ve yet to learn, Tartt’s has this manner of dropping hints about upcoming events and you know it’s going to happen soon, but you can do nothing as a reader except read on to find out what unfolds. From the very beginning of the book, the reader is aware that the group commits a murder and the rest of the novel is the slow unwinding of that tale. The first half of the novel is almost entirely set up to the climactic scene of murder. In disclosing in the first sentence who dies and who does the killing, the story revolves around understanding the motive behind the act much more than how it was committed. It is riddled with suspense and has a very ominous tone throughout. Parts of it were genuinely creepy. Tartt’s character building is brilliant because these characters are terrible, they’re either racist or homophobic or abusive or problematic in some other way and yet I liked them. The life led by them is almost enviable, they are almost likeable, they are almost good people and their actions are almost justified. I wanted to kill them and join them, see them fail and defend them all at the same time.Richard is one of the most unreliable narrators I ever read. Despite becoming part of the group and forming close relationships with the others; he remains an outsider through much of the book. A lot of the book’s events and character development is seen through the eyes of someone who slowly begins to realise that he doesn’t really know that much about anything after all. I also liked how the book events are in the past for Richard.This filter of memory and the very act of remembering also adds something indescribably sad to the nature of the story, as well as reaffirming how unreliable of a narrator Richard is. I’ll be honest: it drags. It can get boring and repetitive, especially during the winter break section where Richard describes the blistering Vermont cold for about five pages straight. But the second half I find is a lot faster, as the reader gets to see the characters that have been painstakingly developed and described in the first half break down and change in drastic ways in the second.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed The Secret History. I would recommend this to fans of more drawn out mystery novels with complex characters and evocative prose. This novel isn’t for every reader but I believe every one should give it a chance. "

I could squander my review space on a running dialogue that is the beginning, middle and conclusion of the story itself BUT that is merely the sum of it's parts NOT the sum of my reading experience. I could hide myself behind a shadow of past choices and realizations, as I did with Tartt's The Goldfinch, but I feel that would do a disservice to this novel. So what shall I do, you ask?! The Secret History is a story which can, and will, mould and change with you. No two people will ever read this story the same way. Nor, I daresay, will one person ever read it the same way twice. The beauty in Tartt's prose is that it is a glorious tool in self-actualization. It is a foundation by which you may roll and alter within the ebb and flow of your own current - or past - life experiences. I read this story in three chunks, over the space of 15 months, and while I don't recommend this method - the revelations and moments became dreamlike in time-distance - I am not, entirely, sorry to have done it thusly. We, as readers - as people, are ever-evolving and ever-changing and this story feels designed to grow with it's readers. To branch out, narrow down or broadly encapsulate as so suits the reader's mood. I have dozens of sticky-noted passages I could share here that changed tones or stole my mind for a time; and hundreds more which I'm sure to find on my next reading. I'm left unsure of how to express my love and fear of this novel...
Beauty is harsh.

“Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it.”
Wow. What did I just read? I finished it a few hours ago but I still feel like I don’t have any words worth this book. It truly is an intense experience that I highly recommend to everyone– serioulsy, go read this book. Please. And no need to know what it’s all about– it also is what makes this reading experience so special.
“I suppose at one time in my life I might have had any number of stories, but now there is no other. This is the only story I will ever be able to tell.”
You have to know this about me: I am obsessed with novels that take place in college. I have no idea why, I just do. And when I realised that this book was one of them, it made me the happiest. However, The Secret History is very different from what you may usually read– at least, I know it was for me. Little did I know that this book will go this far, will push the characters so much, will make me feel so many things and experience so much.What I may have loved the most is Donna Tartt’s writing style. I believe that a few but intense things happen throughout this novel (well, truly intense) but still, she manages to get us hooked from the first page. There may be a lot of narration and the whole plot may be slow, you still cannot put this book down. Also, even though we know from the first page what the main event will be, it doesn’t ruin the whole book. On the contrary, the author creates a tension which grows more and more through each chapter until the whole thing somehow explodes. It is amazingly well-done and I wish I was as talented as Donna Tartt is. Trust me, you really don’t know where this story will take you.When it comes to the characters, they were all flawed and, let’s be honest, ominous. The main character, Richard, isn’t really the main character– it’s the whole gang that creates the story and he is just here, not doing much but doing enough to let us see correctly through his eyes everything that is happening. Following him allows the reader to totally be in the story and to see everything from inside. As a reader, we somehow become a witness of this Secret History and that is why the whole book is so captivating. You can truly see, witness, how the tension is created, where everything started, when it changed, where some made a mistake, why it went in this direction...As for who was my favourite, I may have to say Francis but I didn’t really give much thoughts about it. Every member of this Greek gang was special and interesting– they were all peculiar, unique, disturbing even but oh so fascinating, dazzling. 
“Are you happy here?"" I said at last.He considered this for a moment. ""Not particularly,"" he said. ""But you're not very happy where you are, either.”
I wish I could write more but I’m afraid I will end up spoiling anyone. All I still need to say is that this book is beautiful and disconcerting. It is deep, somehow completely crazy, but also completely captivating. And the ending… well, let’s say that I still don’t know what to say. I put a hand on my mouth while reading it, as if it was happening in front of me, and even though I know how it went this far, I still feel aghast.So please, read The Secret History. Do not wait any more minute, do not do like me and let it stay in your TBR pile forever– it is a pretty book but it is so much more than that. The story will stay with me for a long time and it definitely is one of my favourite book of the year (well, maybe ever)."
263,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,Rating 4 out of 5,"A book that kept me at arm’s length in a claustrophobic plot and circle of youth for so long that the resolution of the last hundred pages was like water in the desert. We see from the prologue that our narrator has participated in some form of group murder in the Vermont woods of a student peer and that this story has defined his life to some distant point he is writing from. With the true beginning, we follow Richard arriving at the fictional small liberal arts college Hampden as a fish out of water, a working class kid from California among the snobby and aimless rich. His minimal sense of identity makes it easy for him to succumb to the allure of scholarship with a clique of five others under the guidance of master Greek classicist Julian. I so admire the skill with which Tartt draws the characters out and Richard’s pathway to belonging to a sort of tribal family he never had, inspired by the wise and devoted father figure Julian. While other students may pursue the nirvana of drugs, sex, and rock and roll, they assume a mantle of exclusive superiority in their high purpose. They all shared a certain coolness, a cruel, mannered charm which was not modern in the least but had the strange cold breath of the ancient world : they were magnificent creatures, such eyes, such hands, such looks - sic oculos, sic ille manus, sic ora ferebat.But the seed Julian plants is dangerous when the class explores his thoughts about the Greek’s version of Wallace Steven’s “death is the mother of beauty”: It's a very Greek idea, and a very profound one. Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it. And what could be more terrifying and beautiful, to souls like the Greeks or our own, than to lose control completely? To throw off the chains of being for an instant, to shatter the accident of our mortal selves? …If we are strong enough in our souls we can rip away the veil and look that naked, terrible beauty right in the face; let God consume us, devour us, unstring our bones. Then spit us out reborn.The core of the group, sans Richard, follows their leader Henry with attempts to achieve this state of wilding Bachanale, with disastrous consequences. The threat of discovery of their secret moves Richard to cross a boundary of civilization. The foundations of trust, friendship, sacrifice, and classical heroism are all undermined in a long downward spiral, like watching a train wreck in slow motion. There is an elegance is Tartt’s unfolding of this tragic tale. But personally I lost a lot of patience with what in effect becomes a prolonged psychological horror story. Richard survives somehow the unveiling of masks that most people live behind, and I suppose that confirms Nietsche as peachy with his “that which does not kill you makes you stronger.” Still, as we say in the science fiction sphere, the world-building here is a marvel, consistent with this distilled thought: For if the modern mind is whimsical and discursive, the classical mind is narrow, unhesitating, relentless."

It deserves all the praise of it being a ‘modern classic’ and all of the stuff. It is immersive, hypnotic, and all entrancing. I felt like I was high and living the experience of being an elitist college student learning Classics in 1980s. This is the literary masterpiece that everyone has been raving about, sublimely put together with complex and charismatic ensemble of characters, and I’m so proud that I have experienced all this. I feel like, along with Richard, I too, was an outsider that got absorbed into this world full of sophisticated young scholars, living the tale of how obsession eventually turns them into monsters that eats away at their souls. I too, was drawn to this particular group of friends and found myself, at times, obsessing over them. It is a whole new experience, and one of the best I ever had with a book. The plot is slow, painfully so for its six hundred pages, but even then, Donna Tartt has a way to make the story alive somehow. I could easily get lost within this story and could read about these characters for six hundred more pages. So it is no surprise that I grew so attached to the characters that the ending actually caused me an almost physical longingI could perhaps make comparisons with Donna Tartt’s other book that I’ve also read recently, The Goldfinch. Though the two are scarcely, if anything, similar, I would daresay that both books contain equal sweeping-you-off-your-feet quality in terms of the writing. But I enjoyed The Secret History more immensely and it would certainly be a book I remember throughout the years. The ending, more specifically the very last scene struck a note in me. It was a very VERY powerful ending that makes the whole thing rather ironic, but also fitting. Though I’m at least three decades late to the party, I couldn’t deny that The Secret History is indeed, a triumph."

Además, hubo cosas que a mi parecer quedaron inconclusas, como el misterio detrás de Julian, el profesor de este grupo de chicos.El libro comenzó muy bien, pero de repente se puso a dar vueltas sobre lo mismo; las vivencias de los personajes se convierten casi que en cualquier experiencia universitaria, con la tragedia como componente extra. De resto, incluso las clases de griego, que parecían tan prometedoras al principio, pierden del todo su protagonismo y la atención se vuelca sobre rivalidades, malos entendidos, reuniones, alcohol y drogas. Pensé que la novela explotaría mucho más el componente estético, ya que se supone que es la biblia del Dark academia. Bueno, para mí no lo fue (La sombra del viento sigue siendo mi favorito de esta temática). Y, para dramas universitarios existencialistas, considero que Tokio blues, de Murakami, es un libro más maduro que este.Quería darle tres estrellas, pero debo reconocer que no es una historia mala y que tiene un gran atractivo en sus personajes, en especial en los secundarios. Me gusta el metalenguaje que emplean para comunicarse entre ellos, bien sea a través del griego o de gestos que aprenden a leer a través de la intimidad que logran desarrollar. Por lo demás, es un thriller entretenido y, pese a que la narración es en gran medida directa y sencilla, hay momentos en los que se vuelve sublime. Me habría encantado que eso abundara en el libro y que se aprovechara mejor los elementos que nos presentó al inicio en vez de dirigir su atención al drama universitario que en realidad es. No hay tanto misterio, sino más bien suspenso y carga psicológica. El misterio es una promesa que se insinúa al principio, mas no llega a cumplirse al final."

This is the type of book that you will love or totally hate, there's no in-between. At this point, I'll just let Donna Tartt f**king with my mind and I'll still thank her. She created an atmosphere that was filled with raw and evocative imagery and it became brutal in its subtlety. Every sentence she wrote sprawling in such a magnetic ruse that offers some clear allegorical perspective at once and loses nothing on the process; smart twist, whirlwind pacing, pure madness, and entertainingly unhinged characters. No matter how odd the plot growing, I refuse to part and let them eat me up.

I ended up LOVING IT. This book was beautifully created with such lyrical prose and many notable quotes. Donna Tartt did such an incredible job at creating a vivid, mysterious and dark atmosphere that only enhanced the plot and I could imagine every single scene perfectly. Aswell as this, THE CHARACTER ANALYSIS was amazing and I was constantly left baffled at how complex and intricate each character was (specifically Henry). It was fascinating to see how each character would justify their terrible actions and their reasonings. Characters that are far from perfect and that are painfully ambiguous are always my favourite kind of reads and I absolutely loved pulling apart each one of them. AND THE ENDING?!!! "
269,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/151433374,Rating 5 out of 5,"'The Secret History' is about eccentric students in a prestigious arts college in Vermont, who let Greek culture go to their heads. They decide to have a Greek bacchanal, which goes horribly wrong. During a successful Dionysian frenzy, they murder an innocent farmer, and that's a crime they have to cover up in the end by murdering a fellow student who knows too much. It deals with deception, corrupted innocence, coming of age, and complicity. It's in love with Ancient Greece and full of quotes to Greek philosophy and literature. A highly enjoyable, dark, mystical tale with an underlying message of satirical criticism of privilege and classicism. Reading this book felt like a very complex, adrenaline-rushing ride of a rollercoaster in a satisfying way. The story is captivating and powerful, magnificently written and well-paced. I thoroughly enjoyed my reread, and I recommend it to anyone who likes novels with a deeper meaning in almost every sentence and thought-provoking themes."

Página a página Donna Tartt crea un despliegue inusual de belleza que consiguió estremecerme mediante una prosa rica, reflexiva, un ansia de sabiduría y trascendencia que se tiñe de cruda perversidad y un elenco de personajes que aún siendo mezquinos, peligrosos y superficiales me resultaron irrevocablemente seductores. Los amé. De una forma enferma, corrupta y desesperada los amé, como Richard los amó. Richard, un joven de clase media, escapa de la insignificancia de su vida cuando en una elitista universidad de Vermont se le permite el ingreso a un ambicioso y exclusivo grupo que se dedica al estudio del griego y los textos clásicos. Un banquete de intelectualidad, belleza, filosofía y amoralidad se abre ante él no para ser devorado sino para devorarlo. Las amistades que forma entonces cambian el curso de su vida de forma inequívoca.La autora consigue que en un marco de sabiduría y riqueza se explore la superficialidad e indiferencia de jóvenes regidos por un desdén a lo ordinario, que convencidos de una superioridad intelectual trascienden las normas de la propia moralidad y que incluso en su decadencia, sus vicios, su macabra corrupción individual y colectiva, y con consciencia de que una debería despreciarlos, me hallo seducida por ellos y la podredumbre que esconden bajo los caprichos lujosos y las réplicas agudas. Una novela sobre el crimen, el control, la culpa y la ausencia de ésta, sobre vínculos insólitos, indomitos, sobre actos -y afectos- que escapan de la ética que prima en nuestra modernidad. Una novela que critica la pertenencia a cualquier precio, la impunidad de una clase y el caprichoso desprecio de la juventud hacia todo aquello que no le sea propio. Me arrodillo ante Donna Tartt y le agradezco sus recursos estilísticos, su idea, su exploración de los clásicos, su espiral a la demencia, sus inimitables personajes y su brutal belleza.Camilla Macaulay me es, desde este momento, sagrada."

“For if the modern mind is whimsical and discursive, the classical mind is narrow, unhesitating, relentless. It is not a quality of intelligence that one encounters frequently these days. But though I can digress with the best of them, I am nothing in my soul if not obsessive.”

post-book depression really feels like a period of mourning, you know like, you've fallen deep down the rabbit hole of despair and grief because of the characters you loved for the entirety of a book and now suddenly you are hit with the realisation that you’ll never be able to make new memories with them again... they just linger inside of your soul and refuse to leave...My mind is so deeply scarred after reading this book but somehow I am still trying to squeeze some thoughts out of it and trying to jot them down in this review aaahhhh I am just so blown away by this book. The most aesthetically pleasing and at the same time terrifying piece of literature I’ve ever read.

""It is better to know one book intimately than a hundred superficially.”

 
What’s it about?

the secret history in a nutshell™️:
 flowy white dresses and black suits, the scent of old books and the sound of a typewriter, empty libraries and victorian buildings, existential questions and solitary confinement, 'doing it for the aesthetics', intellectualism™️, self intoxication, ridiculously amplified angst, moral ambiguity, Homer and dead languages and zee 
greek culture.
Disclaimer: this book is really not what it’s synopsis suggests that it is about. It’s so much more than that, it’s about fascination turning into unhealthy romanticism and obsession, about the shallowness of beauty and aesthetics and of the morbid longing that one can have for the picturesque. I can go on and on about all that this book had to offer but I’d rather keep my sporadic thoughts to myself because I think this is one of those symbolically written books that every single individual has to read & experience for themselves, ending up being either in the most darkest/gloomiest or the emptiest corner of their mind ((miserable nonetheless)).

""Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it. And what could be more terrifying and beautiful, to souls like the Greeks or our own, than to lose control completely? To throw off the chains of being for an instant, to shatter the accident of our mortal selves?”

 
The writing.
Goodness I don’t think I’ll ever be able to articulate what I thought of the words of Donna freaking Tartt. I have never read anything like the secret history in my whole life. It’s so so sooo accomplished and is a work of genius. The book’s written in a very nostalgic way and had a really eerie and reminiscent air to it that I rejoiced in *swirls in the true spirit of the theatrical* I don’t know if I have ever felt so known through a writer’s writing??!! I mean is that even a thing… the writing's super dense and hella pretentious but in the best way possible. And it is what stood up the most to me. Really artsy and eloquently poetic. 

“Does such a thing as 'the fatal flaw,' that shows dark crack running down the middle of a life, exist outside literature? I used to think it didn't. Now I think it does. And I think that mine is this: a morbid longing for the picturesque at all costs.”

 
!!!!The characters!!!!
I am going to keep this as brief as possible but know that I am dying to write tombs of books where I fetishize and fangirl in a daze about these characters and also hate them with every inch of me gosh they were terrible and problematic and ignorant and arrogant and so bloody self-consumed but I STILL ENDED UP SYMPATHISING WITH EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM AND THAT’S ALL THERE IS TO IT! PLAIN SYMPATHY CAUSE LOVING THESE CHARACTERS IN A LITERAL SENSE WOULD BE ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMATIC AND WE DON’T WANT THAT!ALSO FIRST THING FIRST THE CHARACTERS ARE SUPER GAY YESSSSS UMM EXCELLENT!!!!Starting from our narrator aka Richard [my fav] papen: he has become one of my most favourite characters ever and I saw so much of myself in him and truly I wouldn’t have wanted anyone but him to narrate this story. Although his narration has been called unreliable which to a certain extent it was but that, was the beauty of it ((the amount of irony that I now see in the word “beauty” is indescribable lmoa)). The fact that we explored all these dynamics and were given these entire characters arcs through his narration & perspective leaves us with an enormous magnitude for personal interpretations which was something that I absolutely adored cause at the end whatever information that we are able to collect regarding the characters was through him which can easily be reinterpreted. The internal contradiction that tartt presents and creates through his narration is absolutely amazing and brilliantly done.

""But isn't it also pain that often makes us most aware of self? It is a terrible thing to learn as a child that one is a being separate from the world, that no one and no thing hurts along with one's burned tongues and skinned knees, that one's aches and pains are all one’s own. Even more terrible, as we grow old, to learn that no person, no matter how beloved, can ever truly understand us. Our own selves make us most unhappy, and that's why we're so anxious to lose them, don't you think?”

[[Richard deserved to be loved, he’s so underrated and it breaks my heart knowing just that!!!!]]Bunny the murdered fellow aka Edmund Corcoran: A homophobic, sexist bigot but probably the only one with a sane mindset (of sorts).Henry White: A sadist psychotic ignorant fool and the leader of the gang™️ who was romanticised a bit too much but god wasn’t he one heck of a fascinating nutcase!! and I hate to admit it but I was so drawn to his character that his death almost made me want to tear up, keyword: Almost!].The twins named Camilla & Charles Macaulay: love me a peculiar pair of siblings. Both of them were honestly a mess and pretty toxic but It was enjoyable reading about their fuckups and just getting to explore a really unhealthy sibling dynamic. I found them to be more interesting than the characters who I initially thought had more to offer but on god these two were a different breed!Francis Abernathy: HE DESERVED BETTER. THAT’S ALL. ((bless his gay, cat loving anxious heart)).Julian Morrow: I guess a quote will do for him:“Julian, will never be a scholar of the very first rate, and that is because he is only capable of seeing things on a selective basis.” Followed by:“There is nothing wrong with the love of Beauty. But Beauty - unless she is wed to something more meaningful - is always superficial.”OVERALL The Secret History is a modern classic and a one of a kind masterpiece. This book's written for all the thinkers out there. A thinking person's treasure. yes! that's how I'd refer to it from now onwards. Please pick it up.  

“There are such things as ghosts. People everywhere have always known that. And we believe in them every bit as much as Homer did. Only now, we call them by different names. Memory. The unconscious.”

This is the only story I will ever be able to tell.”The Secret History is a book unlike any other. Nothing could ever hold a candle to this reading experience and while I wish I could explain to you what this novel is….words just somehow diminish it. Donna Tartt’s ability to write is absolutely incredible. I never knew that the English language could be so beautiful. It almost doesn’t matter what she is writing about. It doesn’t even matter that the characters are despicable, selfish, snobbish rich kids with no sense of compassion for their fellow man. The story is so compelling you can’t stop reading. “It is easy to see things in retrospect. But I was ignorant then of everything but my own happiness, and I don’t know what else to say except that life itself seemed very magical in those days: a web of symbol, coincidence, premonition, omen. Everything, somehow, fit together; some sly and benevolent Providence was revealing itself by degrees and I felt myself trembling on the brink of a fabulous discovery, as though any morning it was all going to come together–my future, my past, the whole of my life–and I was going to sit up in bed like a thunderbolt and say oh! oh! oh!”In the opening line of this book you are told of a murder. You are told by the narrator that he assisted in that murder. Where the story goes from there- the hindsight, the regret- or in some cases, lack thereof- speak volumes of the human condition. If there is one thing Tartt understands- it’s people and their nature. “Could it be because it reminds us that we are alive, of our mortality, of our individual souls- which, after all, we are too afraid to surrender but yet make us feel more miserable than any other thing? But isn't it also pain that often makes us most aware of self? It is a terrible thing to learn as a child that one is a being separate from the world, that no one and no thing hurts along with one's burned tongues and skinned knees, that one's aches and pains are all one’s own. Even more terrible, as we grow old, to learn that no person, no matter how beloved, can ever truly understand us. Our own selves make us most unhappy, and that's why we're so anxious to lose them, don't you think?”You have a beautifully painted picture in your mind of your surroundings- a Vermont college, a group of wealthy twenty-somethings, an elitist Professor of the Classics, Greek study, philosophy, drug and alcohol abuse, blackmail….and of course- murder. No matter what you are doing in your everyday life you will be so distracted by these characters and this story. Your mind will wander endlessly for weeks after you have finished it and you will find that everything you pick up after this book will feel insignificant. “White Sky. Trees fading at the skyline, the mountains gone. My hands dangled from the cuffs of my jacket as if they weren’t my own. I never got used to the way the horizon there could just erase itself and leave you marooned, adrift, in an incomplete dreamscape that was like a sketch for the world you knew -the outline of a single tree standing in for a grove, lamp-posts and chimneys floating up out of context before the surrounding canvas was filled in-an amnesia-land, a kind of skewed Heaven where the old landmarks were recognizable but spaced too far apart, and disarranged, and made terrible by the emptiness around them.”The writing. My god, the writing. If you love words and sentence structure and just the elegance of writing that you had possibly thought of as a lost art- please look no further. This is a book I will revisit over and over. I cherish this book on such an intense level. I had forgotten I could feel so strongly about a book. But, as Tartt herself said in this very book- “It is is better to know one book intimately than a hundred superficially.”"

But I didn’t enjoy it.I think any kind of book that has become hyped takes on a whole new form in your brain: you imagine the plot and the characters to be something that they almost always are not. And I did that because I’m a whore! I couldn’t just set aside my expectations and read it. I was fully expecting this book to change my life, and that’s a big reason it got such a low rating.Of course, I can recognize that the writing is stunning (although sometimes it felt even pretentious), I am tired of boring character driven stories. There are absolutely amazing character driven stories out there that actually explore the characters’ emotions and motivations. But here we are left with a whole bunch of unlikable characters. Yes, I’m well aware that their unlikability is the whole point, but could we at least have had insight into why they acted the way they acted? Give me their passions! Give me their hatred! It felt very surface level to me. In the first couple hundred of pages, I was so excited. The author introduced new aspects of stories, and then just completely ditched them. I was thinking, “Oh my god, this part seems so interesting. I can’t wait to see what will happen with it!” And then we went nowhere with it. And all we got was more of the characters acting like themselves. We get it. The characters are bad people. But what can we learn from that? What was the message? If someone could enlighten me, I would genuinely be very appreciative. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed the storytelling, especially in the first half. But the second half heavily let me down. All of this buildup and foreshadowing that had amounted to nothing. Yeah, maybe that’s how life is, but damn. I could have known that in 200 pages rather than 559. I don’t know guys. If you liked it, please please give me your opinion. I may change my mind about it because I am so malleable it is embarrassing. But that’s my take on it."
286,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,Rating 2 out of 5,"Mixed feelings about this book. Okay, it's well composed, with rich references to high culture (philosophy, the ancient Greeks, Rome ...), quite exciting too (though there were some chapters that slowed down the pace), but I'm not completely wild about this book. Thrillers and detective stories not really are my thing, but if I understood it correctly, the author wanted to offer more, perhaps a kind of 'Crime and Punishment' à la Dostoyevsky? The story is certainly going in that direction, but it is disconcerting that the guilt-issue is not really worked out; Tartt is constantly circling around it, and in the epilogue all remaining protagonists seem not aware of any harm done. Then, is it perhaps more of a study on a special friendship? Certainly, and it particularly is a sketch of how a circle of close friends can fall apart after a traumatic event. It is also interesting to see that Richard, the narrator (very reminiscent of Nick Carraway in 'The Great Gatsby'), really remains an outsider. Perhaps the best way to read this book is as a study on Evil: evil with its very 'normal', humanlike face. Tartt suggests that almost anyone can commit the deeds the five friends did, given the right circumstances and a diminished ethical sensitivity. To me, this was the most interesting angle of the book. But then, I have some issues with a few of the characters. The charismatic personality of teacher Julian initially works very enticing, but he just fades away and remains enigmatic (a kind of demon against his will). The character of Henry is pivotal of course in the story, but his mysterious side does not convince me, he is too 'constructed' by Tartt. Finally, a really troublesome element to me was the careless and thoughtless way of living of the friends (with the exception of Richard): with an endless trail of drink and drugs, which made the second part of the book rather tedious. In short, not a bad book, but one with a number of issues. (2.5 stars)"

I can certainly appreciate how clever and well-written it is, and I will definitely read more by Donna Tartt in the future (I've already bought 'The Goldfinch' so I'll definitely be reading that one) but actually enjoy it? Absolutely not.My main problem with the book is that the central group of characters are a bunch of pretentious, proto-intellectual, effete twats who look down their noses at absolutely everybody other than their beloved teacher, who is also a pretentious twat and who drops them like a red hot shit when he discovers what a six-headed monster he's created at the end of the book.Now, I'm not somebody who has to fall in love with the protagonist(s) in every book I read. I don't even have to like a character in an 'I'd-like-to-hang-out-with-you-in-real-life' kind of way, but for me to connect emotionally with a book, there has to be at least one character I can empathise or sympathise with on some level. It doesn't have to be a big thing; just something, no matter how small. With the characters in this book, however, I could not find a single redeeming feature. Not one thing that made me give a shit what happened to them... and if you don't care what happens to the characters in a book then, really, what's the point?Without empathy for the characters, reading a book becomes and entirely intellectual exercise and if I want that I'd much rather read non-fiction.I didn't completely dislike this book (I don't give three stars to books I completely dislike) but it's never going to make a list of my favourite novels."

I count myself among those who can inhale a novel in 1 or 2 days, but many of these books, wonderful they may be, don't really linger in my memory beyond a few days. Picking up this novel (560 pages; long but nothing crazy), I knew within a few pages that Donna Tartt had written something that would force me to slow my pace and really live with her story for a bit longer than I'm used to. This novel was a shock to my emotions and I found myself in tears by the end. It is really quite a simple story: utilizing just a whisper of magical realism, the author dreams up a group of Greek students who accidentally commit murder while in the thrall of an ancient Greek ritual and subsequently, one out of the group finds out, antagonizing all until they are seemingly forced to murder their friend to escape the consequences of their actions. In the aftermath, after successfully getting away with murder, the repercussions are inevitably tragic. The thing so magical about this book is the heavy heavy suspense, almost brutal in the way it goes on for hundreds of pages, which along the way is written in gorgeously rich, detailed prose. So by the time the murder happens it is an immense relief...but the murder is not the point, it almost feels anticlimactic when it happens; the real suspense--starting from the first page, and on past the murder--is what happens in the aftermath. It is so so haunting and I experienced such a heavy rush of emotions in the moment that the true denouement happens. I'm so grateful for this beautiful novel's existence, it is most certainly one of the best I've ever read. "

I listened to the audiobook and it's 22 hours long, but it's worth sticking with it. Donna Tartt herself acts as the narrator and I can't say that I was particularly thrilled with her performance of reading the novel. There were several choices made with the voices she used for certain characters especially that didn't quite work for me. That said I still enjoyed following Richard's story, even if Richard himself is mostly an onlooker and a bystander in his own story. Personally, I think the story should have been narrated by one of the other cast members to make it a bit more engrossing. Either way, though, I still found myself quite intrigued by the audiobook as it was. "

Розповідь про рідний Південь і дорослішання їй вдається значно краще, ніж стилізації під Діккенса та кампусні романи.Щодо ""Таємної історії"", то в неї спільна проблема з ""Щиголем"", це невиправдано затягнутий роман. Історія про гурт студентів класичної філології, чиє прагнення досягти античного ідеалу призводить до кровопролиття, звичайно, цікава, але не заслуговує майже шісти сотень сторінок дрібним шрифтом. Втім, на перевагу від ""Щиголя"", Тартт тут під кінець не вмикає Достоєвського та не принижується до дидактичного моралізму, хоча не забуває в епілозі підсумувати ніцшеанські амбіції героїв цитатою з книги Буття: ""Бо ти порох, і до пороху повернешся""."

It’s about a group of eccentric college misfits (Henry, Richard, Charles, Francis, Charles , Camilla, and Bunny) who under the tutelage of their enigmatic Greek professor Julian become tangled in a web of self destruction when they push the limits of role playing far past those of normal morality. Shades of the educational eccentricity of Kleinbaum’s Dead Poets Society combined with a cast of spoiled unloveable characters such as those in Ellis’s classic Less than Zero, all told here in a first person narrative.

Donna Tartt is a genius for writing the most evil characters, yet making us still idolize them through Richard’s unreliable narration. Henry’s character is the most interesting in my opinion, as even though he turns out to be the real villain; a psychopath and a master manipulator, he kills himself as a form of self-sacrifice so the other can avoid prison.this book is the definition of pretentious, yet in reality, it is a satire that showcases perfect examples of elitism, social class, and manipulation in academia.I love this book. for some reason, it just stuck with me and even though the characters are infuriating and accomplices to murder, I still think about them and probably will forever."

Figlio di un benzinaio e una casalinga -che immancabilmente gli fanno capire di essere solo un peso- cresce tra ” drive-in, case mobili, ondate di calore che montano su dai tetti di catrame.”. Insomma una provenienza che non ci tiene a sbandierare quando si ritroverà a frequentare Hampden, un piccolo college del Vermont.Si sentirà da subito attratto da un misterioso corso di greco antico tenuto da Julian Morrow, un docente atipico per le modalità con cui conduce le sue esclusive elezioni. L’ammissione ai suoi corsi è prettamente elitaria. Richard in qualche modo entrerà in questa piccola cerchia (quattro ragazzi ed una ragazza) e la sua vita cambierà totalmente.Entrare in relazione con questi ragazzi non si rivelerà facile ma, pian piano, riuscirà ad introdursi in questa amicizia piramidale dove al vertice c’è Harry, il saggio del gruppo oltre che il più ricco. Un personaggio particolare: sembra essere onnisciente e in grado di placare ogni ansia, di risolvere ogni dubbio che attanaglia in continuazione gli altri membri del gruppo.Camilla e Charles sono, invece, due fratelli gemelli molto uniti. Camilla è l’unica ed eterea donna del gruppo. La sua figura non mi è piaciuta: troppo funzionale all’immagine della donna che si sacrifica per l’uomo. Incapace dal punto di vista decisionale e quindi destinata ad essere guidata. Poi c’è Francis che viene allevato dai nonni assieme a sua madre che giovanissima ed abbandonata viene come adottata dai ricchi generi. Ed infine Edmund che per tutti è Bunny. Allevato nel nome del dio denaro in una famiglia che fa di tutto per apparire.Al centro di tutti c’è Julian: il mèntore venerato come immagine della perfezione. Il mondo classico di cui è depositario assume nelle sue mani la forma dell’assoluto: l’unico mondo concepibile e giusto; il solo che può determinare armonia. Julian costruisce in microcosmo appartato che imita le antiche scuole ellenistiche. Il greco e il latino sono usati dai ragazzi anche al di fuori come linguaggio in codice da parlare in mezzo agli altri per non farsi capire. Quest’eccentricità diventa man mano una modalità di vita che stacca, separa dagli altri finché la razionalità soccombe. Non propriamente un thriller ma sicuramente un romanzo di formazione con una profonda analisi psicologica di ogni protagonista di questa storia a tinte forti. Non credo di sbagliare pensando che Donna Tartt avesse in mente Dostoevskij che non manca di citare (” Sono io che ho ucciso la vecchia usuraia e sua sorella Lizaveta con un'ascia, per derubarle.”). Anche qui come in “Delitto e castigo” non è tanto l’atto delittuoso ad essere centrale quanto l’angoscia che ne scaturisce. Un tormento ossessionante.Tre stelle e mezza a simboleggiare una piena sufficienza. Il romanzo mi è piaciuto sicuramente per l’idea.Ho trovato, tuttavia, un certo accanimento nel tratteggiare le varie personalità e dunque una certa ripetizione che- secondo me- si poteva evitare. Molto (molto, molto) alcool. Molte (molte, molte) droghe…Ragazzi particolari questi. Niente rave ma riti bacchici e dionisiaci per questa “storia segreta” (“The secret history” è il titolo originale)[Leggerò sicuramente “Il cardellino”. ]” (…) ho solo da darmi un'occhiata alle spalle perché tutti questi anni svaniscano, e io lo riveda di nuovo dietro di me, il burrone che mi sorge incontro, verde e nero tra i virgulti, un'immagine che non mi abbandonerà mai. Suppongo che a un certo punto, nella mia vita, avrei potuto narrare un gran numero di storie, ma ora non ve ne sono altre. Questa è l'unica storia che riuscirò mai a raccontare.”"

Την Donna Tartt την ανακάλυψα με την «Καρδερίνα», το τελευταίο της βιβλίο κι αφού σε γενικές γραμμές, η γραφή της μου κολλούσε, όταν βρήκα το ‘πρωτάκι’ της σε τιμή ευκαιρίας, το πήρα.«Η μυστική ιστορία» ξεκινάει μ’έναν φόνο, όπου εκτός από το θύμα, τον Μπάνυ, γνωρίζουμε (έκπληξη!) και τους θύτες: τους συμφοιτητές και φίλους του στις κλασσικές σπουδές στο Πανεπιστήμιο του Χάμπντεν. Κεντρικός ήρωας ο Ρίτσαρντ Παπέν, ένας πρωτοετής φοιτητής που θα θελήσει να εισχωρήσει στο στενό κλοιό – μαθητών των ελληνικών κλασσικών σπουδών του περίεργου καθηγητή Τζούλιαν και κούκου! θα τα καταφέρει. Έτσι έχουμε έναν κύκλο έξι φοιτητών γύρω – γύρω όλοι και στη μέση ο Μανώλης (sorry o Τζούλιαν) που τους καθοδηγεί και τους διδάσκει. Μέχρι που ένα γεγονός, θα τους οδηγήσει στο γκρεμοτσάκισμα του φίλου τους του Μπάνυ. (Μην με κατηγορείτε για spoiler – αυτό το αποκαλύπτει η ίδια η συγγραφέας στις πρώτες δέκα σελίδες).Το βιβλίο χωρίζεται σε δύο μέρη. Στο πρώτο: τι έγινε μέχρι να φτάσουν στο φόνο. Στο δεύτερο: τι έγινε after φόνου. Το πρώτο μέρος σαφώς πιο ενδιαφέρον από το δεύτερο. Ο τρόπος γραφής της Tartt μου ταιριάζει. Έχει μια κινηματογραφική ματιά (χωρίς να γίνεται φτηνή σεναριακή), περιγραφικές σκηνές που δεν κόβεις τις φλέβες σου από τη βαρεμάρα, αναφορές σε βιβλία και συγγραφείς. Επίσης πάντα μου κεντρίζουν το ενδιαφέρον βιβλία που έχουν γραφεί από ξένους κι έχουν αναφορές σε ελληνική παιδεία, ελληνικά βιβλία, ελληνικά μέρη, ελληνικά beachόμπαρα (άσχετο άλλα ένεκα της αυγουστιάτικης ζέστης). Μέχρι και η Μύκονος παρελαύνει σε μια σειρά του βιβλίου από την οποία ο Χένρι (ένας εκ των έξι φοιτητών) αγόρασε μια ελληνική γραφομηχανή. Τώρα να πας στη Μύκονο για ν’αγοράσεις γραφομηχανή; Αυτό είναι άλλη ιστορία που δεν θα την αναλύσουμε τώρα. Στο δεύτερο βιβλίο, τη συγγραφέα την πιάνει μια ακατάσχετη λογοδιάρροια και το πηγαινοφέρνει συνέχεια γύρω από το ίδιο πράγμα (κι εντάξει μπορεί να θέλησε να δείξει την αγωνία και τη νευρική κατάπτωση των ηρώων αλλά μαζί με τα νεύρα των ηρώων έγιναν κρόσια και τα δικά μας νεύρα). Έχω αναφέρει και στο παρελθόν πως είμαι σκορόφιδον άκρως ευρωπαϊκών και ο αέρας της Αμερικής είναι βαρύς για μένα. Δεν ξέρω ειλικρινά εάν στο Αμέρικα τα ναρκωτικά τα πουλάνε στα καραμελάδικα, αλλά έπαθα overdose από τα τσιγάρα, τα ποτά και τα ναρκωτικά σε ένα βιβλίο που σίγουρα ο στόχος του δεν ήταν όλα τα παραπάνω.Τους ήρωες δεν θα τους χαρακτήριζα ακριβώς χάρτινους, είχαν μια σχετική ένταση ορισμένες φορές, αλλά οι αντιδράσεις τους ώρες – ώρες ήταν ξεκούδουνες (αλλά να μου πεις από την πολύ μαστούρα, τι να περιμένει κανείς;;;)Η συγγραφέας είχε καλλιεργήσει (τουλάχιστον εγώ αυτό εξέλαβα) προσδοκίες από το χαρακτήρα του καθηγητή Τζούλιαν, ο οποίος ξεφουσκώνει τόσο απότομα που ούτε να τον κράξω δεν μπορώ. [κάπου διάβασα πως έγινε αυτό για να διαχωρίσει η συγγραφέας το ‘φαίνεσθαι’ από το ‘είναι’ – μπορεί να είναι κι έτσι, τι να πω κι εγώ; Ένα δύσμοιρο σκορόφιδο είμαι…]Το τέλος υστερεί κατά πολύ του υπόλοιπου βιβλίου. Ρηχό, σαν αμερικάνικη σαπουνόπερα όπου στο τέλος βγαίνουν γράμματα στην οθόνη και μας πληροφορούν για τη μετέπειτα ζωή των ηρώων ο τάδε παντρεύτηκε την τάδε κι έζησαν αυτοί καλά κι εμείς καλύτερα (δεν σας κάνω σπόιλερ μη με βρίζετε…)Εν κατακλείδει: Καλογραμμένο οκ αλλά όχι και chef d’oeuvre. 2/3 λοιπόν έχω διαβάσει από Donna Tartt, πράγμα που σημαίνει πως αν πέσει στα χέρια μου και το άλλο της βιβλίο θα το διαβάσω αλλά δεν θα τρέξω κι αξημέρωτα για να το αγοράσω.Βαθμολογία: 7/10 (πόσα drugs και πόση φλυαρία να αντέξει κανείς;)Readathon 2017: Ένα βιβλίο που ανακαλύψατε μέσω Goodreads ή Instagram [29/80]Υ.Γ.

Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver for it.” Durante la lettura di “Dio di illusioni” (o “The Secret History”, che dir si voglia), non ho potuto fare a meno di formulare ripetutamente un pensiero quasi infantile: “ma che cattive che sono queste persone”.Perché se vi aspettate di empatizzare con i giovani protagonisti creati dalla mente perversa (eppur geniale) di Donna Tartt, allora scordatevelo. O meglio, spero per voi che non sia così: perché i personaggi di “Dio di Illusioni” spazzano via ogni tentativo di empatia. Sono superbi e narcisisti. Così egoisti da risultare crudeli. Viziati oltre ogni limite. Sono tutti talmente meschini e perfidi che non ne salva neanche uno.Persino il protagonista assoluto, Richard, dal cui punto di vista sono narrate le vicende, per quanto nato in un contesto ben più umile rispetto ai suoi cari amici, alla fine non si dimostra poi così diverso dagli altri. Molte recensioni descrivono questo romanzo come pretenzioso. Ma perché? Perché i protagonisti sono grecisti fissati con la letteratura classica? Beh, a me la cosa non ha pesato. È vero, alcuni riferimenti sono un po' di nicchia, ma non rendono indecifrabile o pesante la narrazione. E l'escamotage delle “lezioni di greco” è perfetto per istruire anche i lettori più a digiuno sulle materie classiche. E poi, il modo in cui la Tartt scrive è talmente scorrevole ed evocativo che intratterebbe anche i muri. Non si può dire che sia un libro semplice o per tutti, questo no, ma non lo definirei neanche pretenzioso; il modo in cui le vicende vengono narrate, così come i suoi strambi e impalpabili protagonisti, fa sentire il lettore in una bolla, questo è vero, ma si tratta di una bolla talmente convincente e affascinante che è impossibile non immaginarsi a camminare tra i corridoi di Hampden, con una sigaretta in una mano e un bicchiere di whiskey nell'altra, mentre si commentano i classici e fuori scende la fredda neve del Vermont. Ma quindi, cos'è “Dio di illusioni”? È un mistery? Un dark academia? Beh, a chiusura di libro, risulta chiaro che “Dio di illusioni” è sì tutto questo, ma anche nulla di ciò. È un'opera talmente brillante e unica da non essere ascrivibile a nessun genere, e cercare di etichettarla vorrebbe dire fare un torto imperdonabile ad essa e alla sua scrittrice. Perché “Dio di illusioni” é prima di tutto un'esperienza, tanto particolare quanto irripetibile. E Donna Tartt, con i suoi personaggi dalle mille personalità, é un meraviglioso genio della narrazione. Non c'è altro da aggiungere: “Dio di illusioni” è un romanzo formidabile a cui non posso che dare 5 stelle pienissime ⭐P.S. Per qualcuno, il finale potrebbe forse risultare la parte più debole del libro; tuttavia, pensandoci e ripensandoci, non vedo altro modo in cui la Tartt avrebbe potuto finire la storia. Per questo e per altri motivi, l'ho comunque pienamente apprezzato."
302,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/808994-doug-bradshaw,Rating 4 out of 5,"Here is a world of elite gifted students from wealthy east coast families who are hand picked by the talented Greek scholar Julian, to have the best one on one education money can buy. And Richard, a scholarship boy from California is somehow allowed into the group to participate. He is smart but inexperienced and of course, quiet and intimidated as he mostly observes and then works hard to become part of the group and to fit in. The students are gifted, especially the leader of the group who seems aloof, only interested in reading Greek literature and poetry and then making brilliant observations, which impress Julian. Richard is on a tight budget and works as an assistant to another professor to make ends meet as he watches the other five in his group spend sometimes hundreds of dollars at a Sunday brunch. This is the setting for the book and it is very affective as Richard is then gradually sucked into their world, so totally different than his own. And what is this world like? What are the other kids really like and is the world of the privileged so much better than his own? There is murder, wealth, incest, another murder, a lot of drinking and drugs, sex, although never explicit, suicide, depression, friendship, gay behavior, manipulations by wealth, fun, love, bonding, yearning for love, sacrifice, drug dealing, alcohol and drug abuse and addiction, shallow behavior by wealthy parents, the juxtaposition of wealthy and poor, and extreme sadness. And of course the normal day-to-day activities of tests, papers, parties and drinking and all of the things that go with them in college.The author is a pro at describing human interaction and emotions and the little things that drive behavior such as love and jealousy. She takes her time developing the individual relationships between the six primary characters and although some of the things that occur are extraordinary, they are ultimately feasible and plausible, even if the end results aren’t exactly wonderful. This is a well crafted and excellent book. I loved being there and in the end, although I was a bit sick inside, I loved the book and will think of it for a long time. "

❝Forgive me, for all the things I did but mostly for the ones that I did not.❞
I seriously do not get the hype. I wish I did. I wish this book resonated with me. I wish I liked it. But, unfortunately, I don’t.The Secret History has been on my TBR for literal years, and I finally decided to pick it up this summer together with my friends. And although I gave it two stars, I didn’t exactly have the most terrible time reading this book. Buddy-reading it was quite fun, and I enjoyed the discussions we had. I just did not enjoy the majority of this book 😭I really disliked the pacing, especially towards the middle of the book. It was honestly a struggle to keep on reading, I was sooo bored. The story meandered way too much for my taste. I just feel like the book is way too long, it could have easily been half the length it is without losing much of significance at all.I didn’t care much for the ending either — it was abrupt and underwhelming. And the excessive use of slurs throughout the whole book felt very unnecessary and gross.Despite all of this, I don’t regret reading The Secret History because I’ve always been curious as to why it’s so popular, and now at least I can say I’ve read it lol╔═══════════════╗

In realtà si tratta di una vicenda assai diversa. Una volta tanto trovo difficile recensire un libro letto. La trama è stata molto seducente in vari punti, noiosa e inutilmente prolissa in altri. Ho apprezzato molto la capacità dell'autrice di stimolare la curiosità con continui colpi di scena, ma, forse, ne ha continuati ad utilizzare con sovrabbondanza, finendo per allungare di troppo una vicenda che poteva concludersi, allo stesso modo, molte pagine prima. Buona la caratterizzazione dei personaggi: peccato che la storia si concentri in prevalenza sulla figura di Richard (l'io narrante) e su Henry per lasciare quasi a semplici comprimari gli altri e dar loro il giusto crilievo solo nell'ultimo centinaio di pagine. La figura di Julian, il professore, a mio parere, poteva essere approfondita di più. Ciò che rimane di questa storia è una profonda sensazione di spaesamento. Ogni giudizio che ci si forma viene presto smentito dai fatti e smentito di nuovo. Impossibile dare giudizi effettivi sui personaggi, come, del resto, è difficile fare con le persone anche nella vita, giacché in ognuno convivono mille personalità spesso tra loro contrastanti. Molti appaiono grotteschi, se non emotivamente anaffettivi. Impera una sorta di egoismo di fondo che sembra essere l'unico, vero leitmotiv del testo e che non viene stemperato neppure dalle frequenti intrusioni poetiche e liriche del protagonista (moltocapprezzate, comunque). Quindi direi tre stelle e mezzo. Non mi sento di dare di più. Non mi è dispiaciuto, ma non è un romanzo che rileggerò."

I could not stop myself from imagining the cast of Buffy in the title roles if this gets made into a film. Maybe it has been made into a film? I have a proven Goodreads review history of not knowing that books have already been made into films... anyway... This is a book which should have been concluded with an amusing chapter by chapter annihilation of the principal characters for being slightly ridiculous and morally reprehensible. Sadly this is not the case. I feel a little cheated. Or perhaps I unknowingly developed a pseudo-Bacchanalian longing of my own? Overall there was little to love about the main characters but the book was strangely compelling nonetheless. It was actually one of seven books I allowed myself in my luggage when I went abroad to work last year. The place I work is devoid of evening entertainment and for the most part, devoid of sane human beings so at the time I was seeking solace in the written word. At the time I would have probably found solace in reading the same 20 pages of the Daily Star for a month so perhaps this review should not be heavily relied upon."

For me, however, the story was not a bright spot in this novel. I found it interesting to a degree, of course it’s not hard to draw me into a dark-academia-murder-mystery novel. But taking a step back, thinking about where this story began and how it ended. For example, Tartt spent a lot of time, especially in the beginning, to build up the character of Julian—only to leave him with a disappointing conclusion. For some, they may think that was the point, and that’ll be enough for them. But when I’m reading fiction and I feel this way, I can’t just chalk up that disappointment to “that’s the point.” I think the review makes it seem like I didn’t like this book, but I did, because the writing was just that good. If anyone else had written this story it would have likely been a DNF. I put so much importance to the story because I ultimately feel like that is the most important part of any novel."

Whoever he is, a long man unknown in his crime or one among many, let that man drag out his life in agony, step by painful step . . .”Oedipus Rex - SophoclesHamartia (ἁμαρτία, from ἁμαρτάνειν hamartánein) is the Greek word for ""to miss the mark"" or ""to err"". Oftentimes it was attributed to Greek tragedy, but it was also used in Christian theology (in this case, the term was applied to the fall of men and to the act of sin). Also known as “the fatal flaw”, it is by no surprise linked to the unofficial genre of dark academia. Think of an academic setting, a smoky mist looming over it, a group of intellectual part-time poets fascinated by the beauty of the unknown, and a homicide - the mistake. There you have it: The Secret History, by Donna Tartt. Winckelmann, before the publication of Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy, argued that Greek art was all about “noble simplicity and quiet grandeur”, but Nietzsche thought the opposite, describing it as “dark and sinister”. Later, he would add that what makes Greek tragedy unique is the fusion between “Dionysian and the Apollonian impulses”. Simply put, both Apollo and Dionysus were sons of Zeus but, while Apollo represented art, music, poetry and, ultimately, rationality, Dionysus was the symbol of passion, emotion and instinct. In other words, chaos. I believe this was the starting point for writing the first drafts of The Secret History. You see, there is a lot to be said about the Greeks. The aforementioned curious mix creates joy in the audience through the illusion of beauty. “As tragedy emerges, the Dionysian triumphs over the Apollonian, but the latter’s beauty blends with the horror of the former” (extract from: “A Morbid Longing for the Picturesque”: The Pursuit of Beauty in Donna Tartt’s The Secret History by Charles Perseus D’Aniello). While Apollo provides ordered beauty, Dionysus signifies nature, terror and the destructiveness of the individual, marking a division between temperance and madness. “Beauty is terror,” says Henry Winter. He is referring to the interaction between the Apollonian and the Dionysian. The murderers committed in the book are described as consuming of the self, but there is said to be beauty despite the pain that derives from them because only through the death of the self there can be the rebirth of something else. The rationality of the Apollonian serves here as a means to justify the violence behind the Dionysian. Tartt masterfully creates duality with the concepts of Dionysian/Apollonian and Hamartia, resulting in an endless dance between control and despair. Exactly the reason why The Secret History can be marketed as a modern Greek tragedy. What I value most about a book is the feeling of missing it months after finishing it. This one has never left my mind since last November and mea culpa for not having given it enough justice upon my first review. This book is meant to be read in a cold setting, precisely where I had the chance to initiate it. In fact, I stayed in Venice for almost a week in November, where I visited art galleries and museums, and also where I bought a bunch of classics (who would’ve doubted it?). I unintentionally made The Secret History into an experience and I miss spending dark, cozy nights with my eyes glued on it - I couldn’t put it down. “Nullus est liber tam malus ut non aliqua parte prosit” (“There is no book so bad that it is not profitable on some part”) as the ancients say. I will do my best to provide an analysis that can finally last on my GR profile. Now, what about the characters, the structure and the suspense?
“It is better to know one book intimately than a hundred superficially.”
In an interview on Charlie Rose in 1992, Donna Tartt asked, referring to the Iliad, how do you create suspense if you know what is going to happen from the very first lines? She said: “I read something about Alfred Hitchcock. He said ‘suspense doesn’t come from a bomb thrown from nowhere at the hero’; it comes from having two people sitting talking at a table and there’s a bomb ticking underneath it, and the audience sees it, but the characters don’t.” The first thing I notice when I read books from Donna Tartt is the quietness of a scene and how every single thing happens calmly, even the most horrible one. The Secret History is a steady tale. It’s not about what is happening now, it is about everything that’s already happened that makes the reading experience amazing. When you look at the plot, it’s that simple. The Secret History is set in a college in Vermont. The action revolves around a group of friends who, inspired by their Greek studies (more precisely, during a bacchanalian rite), commit atrocities and accidentally kill a man. We met the group in its entirety at the beginning, dismembered and wounded upon the conclusion. The story is not the usual thriller, but still it contains the main ingredients for detective fiction, such as secrecy. As the reader you already know who has committed the murder, and you are allowed to dive into the killers’ minds and witness their psychological self-destruction. Torned between the Apollonian and Dionysian (between a dreaming state, full of illusions, and a state of intoxication), the characters represent Nietsche’s conception of the satyr. They are both the principle of individuality and that of destruction, and for some reason, they are delighted to be in that state. In my annotations I wrote “Henry is a work of terror and art”. Even when Richard, the narrator, comes to confront him, he doesn’t show a bit of emotion. The general emotional distress contributes to detached storytelling. The five of them are drained from pity, and Richard soon discovers that there are a few people that are really fond of him. But returning to Henry, I believe he’s the real main character. Henry is a chess master, in control of any kind of situation. Continuing with the analysis, I would say he embodies the epitome of the Apollonian, while Richard is a pure imitation of it. About Henry, Bunny says that he is the type of person who positions himself the same level of Plato, and this consideration puts him even more in the aforementioned dreaming state of the Apollonian. (Not to mention, his academic performance and devotion to study as well empathizes with this lifestyle.) In the end, despite preferring the Apollonian, Henry equally engages with the Dionysian. “After all, the appeal to stop being yourself, even for a little while, is very great … To escape the cognitive mode of experience, to transcend the accident of one’s moment of being.”Never have I ever related to a character like Henry. He lacks any redeeming quality, and falls out of place throughout most of the book. His ideals consist in living a life as similar to the Greeks’ as possible, but the life he aspires to is that of Greek high society, which could be an interpretation to why he does not view the farmer���s death as a crime. Take this passage from the book as an example: ""But how"" said Charles, who was close to tears, “how can you possibly justify cold-blooded murder?’ / Henry lit a cigarette. “I prefer to think of it,” he had said, “as redistribution of matter.”The Secret History could be compared to a gothic book. In particular Tartt is an expert in symbolism. Coldness is recurring not just to describe the atmosphere or the weather conditions, but is present in terms of how people are perceived, just like in Henry’s case. Snow is present during the murders. An unexpected element when it’s supposed to be almost summer. That said, Tartt has mixed many genres; it's difficult to give this book a precise one. In my old review I interpreted the story as a tale about “who you can trust and how appearances are deceiving.” Although I am now convinced that the main objective of Donna Tartt was that of being as faithful to the model of Greek tragedies as possible, this book is full of keys to interpretation. That is the magic of it, and I could go on forever discussing its symbolism. But, y’know, GR word limits. 
“Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it.”
When something gets popular, it’s easy to spread hate on it, especially on TikTok. Dark Academia is a trend more than a genre, that’s why I call it “unofficial”. Yes, the vibes are beautiful and inspiring, but it’s easy to miss the point of The Secret History when all you can think of when analyzing it are the pleasant, autumnal vibes and romanticization over the ‘’elite-scholastic-environment’’. I cannot cover the topic here because it could be redundant and inappropriate for the sake of this review, but I don’t really know where all the hate towards The Secret History comes from, just like with Normal People. On the other hand, I do understand why some fail to like it. Sometimes I ask myself who Donna Tartt thinks she’s writing for. If I were to find any issue, it would be its length. The recurring filler parts were annoying, because in those scenes not much happens to the characters apart from them drinking alcohol and never being sober. I know they are supposed to show us how much the characters are disturbed and unhealthy, immoral even, but it could've been done in many other ways, in less than three-hundred pages. Towards the end of the novel I had the feeling the writing style was becoming uncaring and exhausted. But apart from that (I don’t really care about these futile details, I’m sorry), The Secret History confirms itself as being one of my favorite novels of all time. As for the issues with Dark Academia that I don’t want to address, I’ll leave some articles and YouTube video essays I found on the Internet to which I do (to some extent) agree.

Repleta de complejidad y personajes miméticos, este es el tipo de libro del que no puedes confiar en ningún momento ya que ni su propio narrador puede fiarse de él mismo. Brutal.Sin duda alguna el punto fuerte de la novela es su ambientación. Tartt maneja un nivel de detalle vivido que en muy pocas veces me ha hecho sentir tan dentro de una historia. Además, consigue muy bien el efecto de estar dentro de una universidad. Profundizar en cada uno de los temas que están estudiando hace mucho más realista y creíble que los personajes sean estudiantes, algo que por lo general está muy olvidado o dejado de lado en otras novelas cuyo ámbito principal es el estudiantil.Nos encontramos ante una amplia carta de personajes principales, siendo un total de seis, siendo el narrador uno de ellos. Lamentablemente, solo tres de ellos tienen desarrollo decente. No tengo claro todavía qué fue lo que fallo en el libro, si el narrador en primera persona haciendo que veamos un punto de vista totalmente sesgado y subjetivo; tal vez que simplemente los demás ""protagonistas"" realmente estaban ahí para hacer relleno y darme un poco más de drama a la situación; o que la misma Donna tengo favoritos entre sus propios personajes, lo que, desde mi perspectiva, sería una pena. Para mi tanto Camilla, como Francis y Charles se perdieron entre las bellas descripciones de sus apariencias y no tienen ni una cuarta parte de profundidad como la vimos en otros personajes como Henry, Bunny o el propio Richard. Lo mismo siento que le pasó a Julian. Eran personajes que prometían ser mucho más importantes de lo que veíamos al principio, que constantemente veíamos enaltecidos e incluso endiosados sin ningún tipo de motivación y creo que ese el mayor fallo con ""The Secret history"".La autora tiene un montón de ideas, premisas, subtramas y personajes que simplemente se dejan sin desarrollar. Se siente como cuando tu amiga te dice ""te tengo un chisme buenísimo"" y luego no te cuenta nada. Este libro se sintió como un montón de promesas sin cumplir, donde las palabras del narrador se terminaron comiendo las acciones de los personajes, lo que es una pena. Camillas fue una de mis más grandes dolores, ya que se sintió como una mujer adorno, una mujer florero, que solo estaba en el grupo para que todos lo hombres estuvieran perdidamente enamorados de ella y no le ayudaba en lo absoluto que Richard estuviera constantemente remarcando ""lo bella e inalcanzable"" que era. El perfecto ejemplo de manic pixie dream girl, desde mi punto de vista.Otro aspecto importante y creo que definitorio para que te llegue a gustar este libro, no es solo la edad en la que vayas a leerlo (que también influye muchísimo), es que ningún personaje es bueno del todo. De hecho, un argumento sólido es que realmente todos son, hasta cierto punto, malas personas. A mi me encantó conocer más sobre los problemas de cada uno, sus adicciones e inestabilidades emocionales y mentales. Esta es una historia repleta de dificultades y que se ve sostenida por sus personajes. Aunque la trama sea sumamente compleja y veamos el desarrollo de una historia en concreto, realmente este es prototipo estándar de libro regido por personajes. Las magia de leer ""The Secret history"" es poder llegar a conocer más sobre cada uno de los protagonistas, su pasado, su personalidad, las cosas que han hecho, porqué es que son tan unidos, por qué deciden estudiar letras clásicas y que es lo que esconden. Para mi este es un libro de problemas donde vemos los interminables asuntos un grupo no tan reducido de protagonistas, pero también podemos ver los propios problemas internos que estos deben afrontar. Es una historia profunda, compleja, difícil de asimilar y digerir que no te va a dejar indiferente en lo absoluto. Habían momentos donde se me revolvía el estómago, me daban ganas de golpear a los personajes, darles una sacudida, gritarles, me generaron un asco genuino y me hicieron pasar por todas las emociones que puedan imaginar.En definitiva me quería con ""El jilguero"" de la misma autora, aunque no pude evitar ver cierto patrón entre una novela y otra. Sin duda alguna y siendo objetivos, ""The Secret history"" es una buena novela, no para mí o al menos no para el momento lector en que la leí, pero debo reconocer que está hecha con cariño.Para mis chicas listas que adoran estudiar, viven por y para la validación académica y están enamoradas del villano con personalidad debatible, esta es su novela ;)"

Πρώτα διάβασα την Καρδερίνα πρόπερσι και σε όποιον το έλεγα η πιο συχνή αντίδραση ήταν το ""Μα καλά, δεν έχεις διαβάσει τη Μυστική Ιστορία;"". Το είχα ακούσει πολλές φορές μέσα στα χρόνια, αλλά μάλλον ο όγκος του με απέτρεπε κι έπρεπε να έρθω σε επαφή με το τρίτο βιβλίο της Ταρτ και να καταλάβω πώς μπορεί να κάνει 1000 σελίδες να εξανεμίζονται σε λίγες μέρες για να επιστρέψω στο πρώτο.Δεν είναι τυχαίο τελικά που γράφει ένα βιβλίο κάθε 11 χρόνια. Τόσος όγκος γνώσεων και πληροφοριών θέλει πολλά χρόνια όχι μόνο να αποκτηθεί, αλλά και να κατακτηθεί προκειμένου να γίνει λογοτεχνικό υλικό, πόσο μάλλον συναρπαστική λογοτεχνία κι όχι επιδεικτική επίδειξη γνώσεων. Στον αντίποδα του Brett Easton Ellis, με τον οποίο σπούδασαν μαζί στο ίδιο κολλέγιο (και σε κάποια φάση έβγαιναν κιόλας -omg, θα ήθελα να είμαι παρών σε ένα date τους) και του οποίου το πρώτο βιβλίο (Less than zero) επίσης έχει ως αναφορά το φοιτητικά χρόνια στο ίδιο σχολείο, το Secret History κάθε άλλο παρά μινιμαλιστικό είναι. Διεξοδική κι εξαντλητική καταγραφή του εγκλήματος (όχι μόνο ένα) και της τιμωρίας (;) μιας παρέας αλαζονικών και σνομπ νέων, το βιβλίο ξεκινά από την προσπάθεια ενός middle class ανερμάτιστου Καλιφορνέζου να βρει προσανατολισμό σε ένα αφιλόξενο ακαδημαϊκό περιβάλλον για να καταλήξει σε μια αμοραλιστική απάντηση στον Ντοστογιέφσκι, τον Ευριπίδη και τα ρομαντικά αγγλικά μυθιστορήματα για το νόημα της ζωής μέσα από την Τέχνη και την Ομορφιά. Όλα είναι κενά σαν το χιονισμένο τοπίο του Βερμόντ και πίσω από τους όγκους των βιβλίων κρύβεται ένα μεγάλο κι απελπισμένο τίποτα, το οποίο ούτε ο διονυσιασμός, ούτε η μανία, ούτε η έκσταση θα καλύψουν. Γνήσια αμερικάνικη παρά τις πάμπολλες διακειμενικές αναφορές σε πολλές κουλτούρες, η Μυστική Ιστορία είναι κλασική και μεταμοντέρνα λογοτεχνία ταυτόχρονα, ένα βιβλίο αριστοτεχνικά δομημένο και πολυεπίπεδο, τόσο αναφορικά με την ψυχοσύνθεση κάθε χαρακτήρα ξεχωριστά, όσο κι ως προς την ταξική ανάλυση της βαριεστημένης upper class Αμερικής και την αποτυχία του να γίνεις καλύτερος άνθρωπος μέσω της μόρφωσης.

**4.5 stars**
It’s quite hard to come up with a review for a book that’s so insanely popular, across almost every category of readers I’ve ever come across. Also, there’s the fear of sounding unoriginal. I will not say, however, that the story is the most original one I’ve ever come across. There are clear inspirations everywhere, from the obvious ones like Fitzgerald, Salinger, Dostoevsky, and Kleinbaum, to the uncanny resemblance I found with one book by Mezrich, though that came out years later. Also reminiscent of বিশ্বাসঘাতক by Narayan Sanyal, especially in the way the story unfolds (irrelevant that Sanyal’s work is non-fiction, like Mezrich’s).But of course, after I finished it, I found myself incapable of gathering all my feelings about the novel, they felt so all over the place. The length of the novel ensures an effective Dickensian approach but has certain demerits where certain characters remain less fleshed out than others, like Camilia or Francis, compared to, say, Henry. And this doesn’t at all add to the aura of mystery. Also, I expected to see more of Julian, but that may be due to the blurb, which made him appear as a more eccentric version of John Keating from Dead Poets Society.I don’t wish to dig below the surface level on my first read, so let’s not drag this review any further. I finished reading it around two weeks before, and when I did, I was quite awestruck. Now that I’ve had the time to ponder and that initial feelings have subsided, of course, the flaws have become clearer, but that doesn’t mean at all that I didn’t love it. (It’s freaking 600+ pages and I’ve already started rereading it, doesn’t that tell enough?) Hope I can get more out of it this time, and come up with a write-up at least less vague than this one. And I'm sure it will move up to a clear 5."
313,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16064122-alison,Rating 4 out of 5,"Here's the thing: I am the ultimate hoe for Dark Academia. I've read the most popular titles and love them all, so naturally I was expecting to love what is basically the Mother of Dark Academia. I put it off for so long because I was afraid I would be disappointed and that ended up being pretty close to what happened.It wasn't exactly that I didn't like this; I loved the overall story and characters. But about 200 pages of this probably could have been cut because they didn't really add anything. By that point, I already loved, or rather respected, the characters and the details just distract from the ending moments that matter. I can see why this was an inspiration, but it felt like it lacked the punch I was looking for and went more for shock factors in some areas. Given how pretentious these characters are suppose to be, I sometimes felt their actions didn't quite fit with the personalities given to them, which could be distracting at times. And I'm still not sure what the motivation for much of any of what they were doing was...Also, I felt no one had mentioned the sheer among of trigger warnings this book needs, so here's what I listed during my read: TW: Homophobia, Slurs, Antisemitism, Gore, Racism, N word, Incest, Self-Harm, Suicide, Hinted Sexual Assault, Assault, Classism"

Tartt's characters are so subtle and nuanced, and her setting is so vivid, the fact that the storyline meanders at times is really more of an inconvenience than any true setback. Readers who want to explore deeper ideas and themes such as the dichotomy of Apollo and Dionysus or the entitlement displayed by children of wealth and privilege will find suitably fertile material for discussion, while others may just enjoy witnessing the tragedy wind down to its inevitable conclusion."

I'm not blind to its flaws--it's overlong and occasionally overwrought, its pacing is uneven--but they don't matter to me. Characterization is so vivid and the setting is so real that this book never fails to fascinate me.This book started a lifelong love of novels set in colleges or boarding schools--and a love of novels with pagan mysteries. Even though all the characters in this novel are pretty unlikeable--I wouldn't invite any of them over for tea--they are irresistibly interesting.This might be my favorite book of all time."

317,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11296522-fatma,Rating 2 out of 5,"me waiting for literally anything that's even remotely interesting to happen in this book With super hyped books like The Secret History, I'm usually wary, to say the least. I've disliked many a hyped book, so I knew there was a chance I wouldn't like this. Regardless, I went into it hoping for the best because I liked the premise and the general subject matter (universities! murder! academia!). And WOW was I disappointed as hell. This book was aggressively underwhelming; I cannot stress this enough. Okay, so, listen, a lot of the times I'll read a book that everyone loved and I'll think I didn't really like this, but I can totally understand why other people would. This was decidedly not the case for The Secret History. I DON'T GET IT. I just don't. What do people like about this book exactly? The characters? They're pieces of shit—no doubt about that. And not even in a omg i love to hate them!!!!!! kind of way either. They're just straight up assholes. And this is not to mention the fact that they're completely underdeveloped. Everything in this dumb book is cloaked in so many layers of convoluted suspense and drama that I couldn't parse out who the hell these characters were. Everyone was so ridiculously shady and dodgy all the time—it got real irritating real fast. And out of the 7 main characters of this book, literally only one (1) of them was female, and surprise surprise she barely had any scenes. She was just the ethereal, beautiful presence that Richard occasionally lost his shit over. (At one point he thinks, ""I felt a fierce, nearly irresistible desire to seize Camilla by her bruised wrist, twist her arm behind her back until she cried out, throw her on my bed: strangle her, rape her, I don't know what."" what the actual fuck.) (oh also, check out this description of her lol: ""Camilla looked enchanting. She wore a narrow sleeveless dress, salmon-colored, which exposed a pair of pretty collarbones and the sweet frail vertebrae at the base of her neck—lovely kneecaps, lovely ankles, lovely bare, strong-muscled legs."" richard, chill, pls. lovely kneecaps? really?) And I know, I know, the characters are supposed to be unlikable silly, that's the whole point! But there's a fine line between unlikable/abrasive but still sympathetic, or at least understandable, and unbearably shitty. Needless to say, this book crossed that line, for me at least. It felt like Tartt was just like look at these asshole characters! how dark, right? they committed murder and they're assholes and they're in university! doesn't this make the book so dark and suspenseful! No.Ok, so clearly I didn't warm up to the characters. What about the plot? That could've at least made up for what the characters lacked, right? lol, no. First of all, WHAT PLOT? This book basically had no plot, or at least a very, very elementary one. I kept expecting something shocking to happen and wow me, but it never came. And what made the plot even worse is that it was SO DAMN DRAWN OUT. Like I gotta give Tartt props for stretching out a plot that was basically nonexistent into a 560-page book. Holy hell. Everything took ssssoooooo loooongggggg to happen. Just pages and pages and pages devoted to characters doing drugs and taking pills and getting drunk and just making dumbass phonecalls. Henry calls Richard, Richard visits Francis, Charles calls Richard who finds Francis at Henry's, Francis is at Richard's calling Charles—seemingly endless combinations of scenes like this just drove me up the fucking wall omg. I'd initially thought this book was a mystery, but it's really not. There is no mystery; you know exactly what's gonna happen from page one. And don't even get me started on how Tartt crams in a bunch of offensive shit in her book just to make it feel gritty or dark or something. Racism, homophobia, physical abuse, fucking incest. HARD PASS.So the characters sucked, ditto for the plot, so that leaves...what? Nothing, really; I liked nothing about this book. The writing was stilted and dry, lacking any kind of vitality. I could not care less about the esoteric discussions of Classics and ancient Greek. I can honestly say that I didn't enjoy a single thing about this book.So, uh, those are pretty much all my thoughts."
318,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5204784-vonia,Rating 3 out of 5,"Here we go with Donna Tartt's debut novel, my second from her. Yes, there was a lot to live up to in my mind after reading her illustrious Pulitzer Prize winner. But this was honestly significantly less impressive than I thought.... At least in some aspects. My number one complaint was how she wrote with so many Greek and Latin phrases, and referred to so many things in the culture, like stories, books, general knowledge. If it were a sprinkling of this, I would have appreciated it as a learning opportunity. However, this occurred pretty much every few pages if not more. Even worse, this was usually without translation of what these phrases meant nor explanation of these references. As an example, there were even several sentences when in the Greek Alphabet! The plot itself was certainly original, its main themes being obsession, guilt, good versus evil, the general phenomena of perfectly good people being driven to desperation, and to an act unfathomable under any different circumstances. Psychology has many documented studies on this, with quite fascinating results. The one thing I have most loved about Tartt since I started reading her works is her precise and phenomenal handle on characterization, giving the reader full access to their minds and the ability to clearly visualize not only them but how it would be inside the deepest recesses of their minds. One feels as if they know these characters intimately. I can think of very few authors that do this as well as her. Bunny, Camille, Charles, Francis, Henry. Mostly unlikeable. Or narrator, Richard Papen. A good guy, but easily failed under peer pressure time and time again. Julian, the professor that teaches their exclusive Greek studies (extremely selective with his students obviously, and requires them to drop every single other class at the university so that he is in complete control of their education), is intriguing, but really one cannot believe he is acting in their best interest. **** Spoilers **** This story did indeed keep my rapt attention. That is, until the beginning of the great murder mystery was revealed, and the rest was rather predictable, due to several foreshadowing passages. They kill Bunny out of fear that he will blackmail them or tell on them. Then, one by one, the aftermath eliminates all of them in some way. Their lives fall apart for the most part, although some manage to continue with a decent life, although far lower in quality sure to the guilt of murdering not only an innocent man, but one of their best friends. The leader of the group, the mastermind who essentially planned Bunny's demise, eventually commits suicide. Not too much of a surprise. I found the premise a tad unbelievable. An understatement I surely do not believe in their mystical seance-paranormal-religious-encounter in which they evidently list sender of themselves and somehow killed a man without consciously recognizing what they were found until they came to and saw the slaughtered body. Imagine how that would hold up in court, even with some case for the insanity plea! Honestly, like I said, a lot of events seem a far stretch from reality, including: the possibility of a professor taking over the entire curriculum for several students, the first murder itself, the blase attitude of each of the characters to everything from rape to death, and the apparent survival in freezing weather in a room with an open roof. More so, an entire winter.Disappointed. The Goldfinch was twice as good, as evidenced by the Pulitzer Prize in Literature. No doubt a very accomplished and undeniably impressive debut novel. I do have to say that philosophy students and those of Greek and Latin mythology; The Classics, would absorb this book with much more pleasure than I did. That being said, it still needs much refinement to make it a great book from a great writer rather than one with potential."

“Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it.”
The first 150 pages of this book were a painful trudge through the pretentious characters and overwritten prose. That isn’t to say that the characters got less pretentious, or the prose got less overworked as the book progressed – rather it’s quite the opposite – but I did slowly find myself adapting, and indeed enjoying, the ridiculousness of the characters and the completely absurd plot. Despite its outrageousness, the story never felt overly unbelievable thanks to the control and precision of Tartt’s words. I hated all of the characters – I found absolutely al of them beyond annoying - I was rooting for each and every one of their downfall - and I loved it. Like I said, I did find some of the writing overworked, some of the quotes were so try-hard it made me cringe a little, but as it seemed like Donna Tartt set out to write the most pretentious and hateful characters possible, the pompous style of writing she deployed did help her achieve this. I have, however, a few (very) minor gripes with this book. Firstly, like I said, the first 150 pages were a complete drag - I almost even dnf’ed. I know it can take a while to settle into a book, but I think 150 pages is far too long for this and this is ultimately the reason that I don’t feel I can give the book 5 stars. I also think a few elements of the book were slightly underdeveloped – particularly the relationship between Charles and Camilla, which, without spoilers, was never fully addressed (perhaps this is a me issue as I don’t see anyone else mentioning this in their reviews). Also, I really hated the French asides that Richard used in his narration (savior faire, raison d’être, laissez-faire etc) although this is definitely a me issue because these are my literature pet peeves for some reason. It just comes across so try-hard and pretentious to me (yes I know that’s the point) and I don’t know why I hate when authors use them but I just do – sorry! The ending of the book, and the epilogue itself, was fantastic – I thought the book had a really satisfactory end, which is a hard feat after 600 pages of mind-f*ckery (!) so props to Donna Tartt.I don’t think this is a book for everyone, but I certainly found it to be an enjoyable read!"

I have always been a bookworm - I remember when I was a kid I would never leave the house without a R.L. Stine book in my hand. Law school kind of dulled my reading habits as I didn’t really have the headspace or time to read for fun. However, The Secret History completely changed that.I read this one about two years ago after a trip to Portland. I visited Powell’s City of Books for the first time and found a used copy (if you haven’t been Powell’s, go book your flight!). I started reading on my flight home and could not put it down. When I finished, I ran to reddit and created a discussion thread, something I had never done before. I found that this one is widely acclaimed, for good reason!Here’s a mini-synopsis: The novel follows six college students studying Greek classics together at a small and elite college in Vermont. Their studies become all-consuming, resulting in the group to killing one of their members by pushing him off of a cliff. This isn’t a spoiler - the murder is revealed in the first sentence of the novel. The reader then figures out why the murder occurred and its consequences.I wish I wrote this book. It’s simply perfect in my eyes. The story is told beautifully and there’s really not a day that goes by where I don’t think about it. Every book I read is inevitably and unjustifiably compared to it, as I am eagerly awaiting another novel that will rock me like this one did. I don’t know if I’ll find one, but I’m content with that. I admittedly haven’t read Donna Tartt’s other two novels. I’m weirdly nervous to read them as my expectations are HIGH. They’re sitting on my shelf, so I will tackle them very soon!"

The characters are not interesting enough to carry this book beyond the main plot points that finished about halfway through, and it really should've been at least 200 pages shorter. Francis and Charles are basically indistinguishable from one another, and Camilla's only personality trait is that she is attractive to Richard. These characters are not just unlikeable, they are also just plain boring. I'm seriously questioning why anyone finds them intriguing or feels like they want to root for them in any way. Henry is the only vaguely interesting character, and I just wish we got more of him.I will say that I think it is incredibly ironic that so many people have taken this book and turned it into nothing but an aesthetic with zero substance because I actually think the critique in this book on the dangers of aestheticism and taking aesthetics too far into reality is one of the best parts of the book. On the note of themes though, I think that if you're interested in the themes in this book (namely re: aestheticism and the arrogance of youth and privilege), The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde explores these same themes but is a far superior book, in my opinion. I'm sure there are also other books that explore these themes, but Dorian Gray was the main one that I was reminded of while reading this.As an aside, the audiobook is awful. Donna Tartt should not be narrating audiobooks, sorry."
322,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3845138-carol,Rating 5 out of 5,"This novel is an elaborate whodunit even though we know almost from the beginning which one of these students is killed. The story chronicles the events that led up to the murder and then its aftermath. Even though it wasn’t as pared down as I usually enjoy, I loved the book and found it to be a compulsive read until the very end.The main character is Richard Papen and he is accepted into a tightly knit group of five other students at a private, liberal arts college in Vermont. They are a group of pompous, overindulged and detached eccentrics enjoying the luxury of study in ancient Greek Philosophy. There are no likeable characters here.The author is the narrator for the audible book, which was thought-provoking (for me) since most of the characters are male. For instance, her inflection for Bunny, a most reprehensible jerk, was very nasal and shrill, which allowed this reader to go along with a shocking turn of events within the group. I was rooting for Bunny’s comeuppance even as I knew that there had to be an eventual time of reckoning for these students. I wasn’t disappointed with the ending.The book requires a willing suspension of disbelief but I found it compelling and unputdownable. "

I used to think it didn't. Now I think it does. And I think that mine is this: a morbid longing for the picturesque at all costs.""  First of all, these lines literally are the most poetic, picturesque, and beautiful way to start a chapter, and no one can tell me otherwise.Reading this book for the second time around is just like reading it for the first time—even better, I must say. Donna Tartt is literally a genius for writing this book. Truly one of my favorites. I always get so excited when I read this book. “I am nothing in my soul if not obsessive.” "

It's funny because I've read it three times, and of all those times, I've never been able to form words on how I feel about it.The Secret History makes me feel a little sad. It always made me a little sad when I thought about it, because even if the characters are cruel, selfish, and insufferable, you can't help but feel bad for them all.No one got the ending they deserved, no one was happy, but at the same time, you have to wonder if they had done it all to themselves, if they really did deserve all of it, and yet they didn't.We just don't get the things we deserve sometimes."

I was completely enthralled the entire book, & I kinda liked that the climax was revealed at the beginning, then the book was explaining how it got to that point. It gave the book a sympathetic twist toward the killers. Even so, it still had quite a few heartpounding twists throughout. As much as I almost hate to say it, this really would make a great movie. :)"
