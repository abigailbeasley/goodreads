“The face you give the world tells the world how to treat you.”
There is something deeply unhealthy about this book. It's in the characters, in the story, in the relationships, in the sex, and just in the general mood of the novel. Reading this made me feel a little unwell, both physically and mentally, but I am glad I did. If you know me, you'll know I love complex characters with issues that feel raw and real, rather than melodramatic. The people in this novel are majorly fucked up, no one is without a dark past and everyone, it seems, has a horror story.The protagonist - Camille Preaker - was just thirteen when her sister died and fuelled by grief (amongst other things) Camille spent her teen years carving words into her flesh, covering almost every inch of her body with the marks of her pain. Ten years later, Camille Preaker is now a journalist who returns to the small town of her youth to report on the murders of two young girls - girls who had had all of their teeth removed.Camille is soon caught up in the town once again, she tries to get along with the mother who never loved her and establish a relationship with the troublesome half sister she hardly knows. It seems that once again small towns hold the biggest secrets and Camille finds herself getting dragged deeper and deeper into the investigation, her fragile state of mind constantly threatening to tip her over the edge.This is one mean and nasty book. I knew I was getting a dark, psychological thriller, but I expected something on par with In The Woods by Tana French. Um, not exactly. Flynn never shies away from the horrific details. You're not going to find anything pleasant in this story; sex, for example, is always something complex - it's an escape or a bargain or a catharsis. Everything else is similar.Flynn does a fantastic job of challenging the notion that women are weak, innocent, damsels in distress. In a world where women are victims - both in their media representation and in statistics - this is a very interesting look at other kinds of women. It's programmed into us to believe that women are safer, kinder, built with an instinct that makes it difficult for them to be cruel and cause pain without reason. Maybe we were always wrong.Last updated: April 2016Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1127870-simon-cleveland-phd-edd,Rating 1 out of 5,"The razor blade on the front cover of the book is what one yearns for right after embarking on this read, sharp blade with which to cut every single page, one by one, until they are so neatly shredded that even the memory of what was written on them becomes non existent. And then, one can use the same razor to end one's own life. I'm still unsure what the author was thinking when she began this book, unless she had some very deep and very disturbing mental issues to work through. This book is dangerous and not because it excites one with a thrilling and suspenseful story. It is dangerous because once one reads it, one loses any desire to look for another book that may restore one's faith in the existence of good books with an uplifting charge. Not only is this book dangerous, but it is sick. Its underlying sickness is that it's emotionally draining and unless readers are looking to load up on more mental baggage (I can't think of anyone who doesn't have enough), I'd stay away from its pain. The main character is a female reporter who returns home on an assignment (covering the serial murders of two little girls). As memories of her painful childhood emerge, readers find a lot more about her character, for example her alcoholic addiction and her obsession to carve words into her own flesh. Waves of her unresolved issues wash away further hopes of a challenging literary work as readers are practically dragged into her problems (not loved enough by her mother, not popular enough in school, not motivated enough in her work) and are subjected to the anguish of either feeling sorry for her or wanting to end her existence. As disturbing details of the two murders resurface, readers are introduced to yet two more characters as equally unpleasant as the first. There is the psychologically unstable (almost emotionally poisonous) personality of her mother and the pathologically sinister and equally disturbed one of the teenage sister. And of course there are the endlessly problematic and mentally crushing details of the small-town's Midwest America (why would one want to read this is beyond my understanding). This book robs one of smiles, of the beauty of life, and even of the reason for love. It is not only bitter, but leaves one with an unpleasant smell of what I'd like to call rotten feelings. I can't brand the book dull (as it did leave me with unwanted thoughts), but I can promise you that you'll feel dull once you've read it. I don't recommend it, but may compare the feelings I have for it to what Chuck Palahniuk's 'Choke' birthed in me."
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/721021-randomanthony,Rating 4 out of 5,"Last week I read the fuck out of Gillian Flynn's catalog. Three novels in eight days while my wife and kids were out of town and a sweltering late July marooned me in one of the house's two air conditioned rooms. So although this review is primarily for Sharp Objects, my favorite of Flynn's trio, let me go on record with Gone Girl (four stars, go read another of the zillion of reviews) and Dark Places (three stars, maybe too many narratives perspectives and too willing to wallow in the muck) as well, but I'm not writing reviews for those two. Sharp Objects, to me, stands out as Flynn's best so far. The narrator and the storyline don't dance with each other in a seamless, synchronized manner; family history and unwritten community norms mosh-pit it up until the collective response to the murders reminded me of that Soundgarden video where all the faces go funhouse-mirror-y. This narrator isn't a shining heroine. She's very human, supremely fucked up, trying to make sense and move forward. Maybe that's what makes Sharp Objects so interesting. Highly recommended, Sharp Objects is the kind of book one could characterize as a summer read. This is the rare novel that both devoted and casual (yes, that sound you hear is me turning up my nose) readers will appreciate, as long as they can handle the psychological darkness. Good for any season, not just a summer read, even. My nose just turned up a little higher. I better stop now before I'm looking at the ceiling.(By the way, if I haven't said so yet, Gillian Flynn is knee-weakening cute.)"

4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma,Rating 4 out of 5,"BEST GILLIAN FLYNN BOOK. By a mile. Sorry, Gone Girl, you are no longer welcome here. (Just kidding I'm going to reread it in one absolute second but will it be as good as this book? No, it will not. Probably. We'll see.)This is so CREEPY and the writing is so visceral and it's so unique. There have probably been thrillers like this one since this one, but definitely not many before. There are so many characters that are just hopelessly fascinating. Like, all of them, basically. Any time the protagonist gets into a conversation with any human person it's a goddamn treat because everyone is so interesting and confusing and you just want to know everything about everyone!!!Flynn also has this fantastic crazy writing style that you feel and picture so hard. Very Virgin Suicides. There are turns of phrase in this book I read four times and promptly filed away as ""you will remember this at random points for the rest of your life.""I don't even know what to say beyond this is a whole new level of good. You have no idea. If the HBO adaptation doesn't do it justice I will goddamn picket the home of Amy Adams with a protest sign but also HOW COULD IT DO IT JUSTICE.I'm a mess. And I'm not even mad about it.Bottom line: How is this Gillian Flynn's first book??? How is this any non-deal-with-devil-having person's first book????? How is this a book?????-------------currently-reading updatesme: yeah i can reread this before the show premieres...even though i haven't finished a book in almost a week...and i have to read another book in its entirety today for school....and the show premieres in less than 9 hours. sure no problem!!!! gillian flynn come thru"
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30604861-emma-giordano,Rating 2 out of 5,"2.5 Stars. Unfortunately, I did not love this book and it is probably my least favorite of Gillian Flynn's work. As this was her debut, I'm happy to say I feel her later works show great improvement and a lot of strength.CW: self-harm, sexualization of children, murder, child abuse (I don't normally put content warnings under spoilers but this warning is so integral to the ending AND it's so specific that I don't want people attacking me for spoiling the book) Munchausen By Proxy I think Gillian Flynn is a brilliant writer, but it was quite obvious that Sharp Objects was her debut. Her prose remains easy to engage with, but it is much more simplistic compared to her later works. That being said, the writing was one of the elements I actually appreciated in this story.I didn't particularly love the plot of the story. The idea of children being murdered and a journalist having to return to their small hometown was super intriguing to me, but the execution fell flat in my opinion. The ""darkness"" I constantly see associated with this book is definitely present - this book is not for the faint of heart, but truthfully, the story was boring in my opinion. I understand some people love small-town stories that focus on gossip and rumors, but it's not my cup of tea. I was missing the exhilarating plot twists from Gone Girl and Dark Places. It was very slow and for the most part, anticlimactic to me. I felt there were so many opportunities for more enticing, eventful scenes to be included but it was taken over by bland character interactions.The big reveals/plot twists are difficult to discuss because my experience is an amalgamation of ""This is surprising"" and ""This is expected."" I feel the best way to describe it is I felt the resolution of the story was clever and well constructed, but it was partially anticipated. I feel the minute details surrounding the resolution were stronger than the big reveal itself if that makes sense. Additionally, the ending felt very rushed as the truth of the mystery is revealed through Camille recollecting the events instead of being shown actively through the story. I think it would have been much stronger had we followed the revaluation in real-time along with Camille's initial reactions as opposed to having the events relayed to readers at a later time. Again, I feel this is a marker of this novel being Flynn's debut work and I can confirm that there is little ""telling, not showing"" in her future books. Overall, I wasn't a fan of Sharp Objects, I think it just wasn't for me, but I'll continue to love Gillian Flynn's work."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11057966-alex,Rating 5 out of 5,"Little buddy read with Her Majesty La Lionne and Jerry on January 31st!! :DThis is my third Gillian Flynn book, after Gone Girl and Dark Places. The first one blew my mind, the second one freaked me out a little and this one really scared me. Sure, after reading 5% of it I was like --a creepy story with the potential of giving me special nightmares, but by 90% I was likeWTF did I just read??All the characters were disturbing, especially even the children. Allow me to start with Camille. She's a reporter, a writer. She's practically obsessed with words, even if they are scribbled on her skinand not necessarily with a pen or marker, if you get my drift. You see, Camille used to be a cutter. She's a little better now, but you never know what can make her snap and get back to her old habit.I can't say I liked her. I hated the way she used Richard and John, her lack of reason, her irresponsibility when she took X with Amma, her 13 year-old half-sister. Yes, Camille, I get that you're fucked-up, but you're 30, get a grip or see a therapist!Amma, Camille's 13 year-old half-sister, is a piece of work.It sure would, sweetie, it sure would...I hated her with a vengeance for countless reasons, but most importantly because she was a little bitch, in all the senses of the word. Adora, the matriarch of the family, Camille and Amma's mother, was also a vision to behold: a bad mother suffering from Münchausen syndrome, who felt the need to bring another child into the world, after Marian, only to smother her in torture and drive her to madness and eventually murder.Who's left? The only character I remotely liked was Richard, the cop. He was hot. He would have been so good for Camille. But noooo, she just had to ruin it all by becoming a cradle-robber under the convenient pretext that she felt the need to comfort and be comforted. As much as the characters annoyed and disturbed me, I enjoyed the story very much. It was shocking, unexpected, creepy, not funny at all and extremely well-written. I will definitely be reading more of Gillian Flynn's novels!5 stars!! "

8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47627265-kaylin-the-re-read-queen,Rating 1 out of 5,"1 StarOverview: I should have known better. I don’t have an excuse.I read Gillian Flynn's other book, Gone Girl, last year—and wasn’t a fan. Everyone raved about it, but I found the characters shallow, the plot twists weak, and the narrative so busy being cynical it didn’t seem to know what it was trying to say. Nevertheless, I’d heard great things about Gillian Flynn’s writing. So I went into this with an open mind--- maybe I had just started with the wrong book! But I really should have known better.  When I wanted to DNF this around 13% of the way through, I should have trusted my instincts and realized Flynn's writing just isn't for me. But I kept seeing reviews talking about “the twist” and how the ending was the best part. So I persevered. Safe to say, I didn’t like this. Actually I think I disliked it more than Gone Girl. *language and mature themes ahead, due to the nature of this book* Pros: I don’t like to rate things so low. I really don’t, and I rarely do it. I was initially going to round this up to a two-star, but I realized I didn't have a real reason. I have 'criteria' for all my ratings and in order to earn two-stars from me, a book has to contain some elements I liked. This contained a handful of descriptions I liked. That’s it. At points in the text, Flynn compares a new-found murder victim’s appearance to that of a baby doll, with mouth open and ready to suckle. This was an incredibly creepy simile that I thought painted the scene quite clearly. Then later, Flynn describes a woman as having “hips like antlers.” In regards to the bony prominence that juts out against the rest of the woman's body. Again, I thought this was an incredibly inventive description that also perfectly illustrated the character. Cons: Oh boy. Here we go. What were these characters supposed to be? Every single character was filled with an intense hatred and cynicism about everything. They were all incredibly violent, shallow people with no other defining characteristics They were all very boring, flat people who just seemed to be awful without any motivation. It seems Flynn’s work relies upon a belief that all people are inherently evil and selfish—which is a popular theory in itself that I’ve seen in a wide variety of fiction. But the characters still need to make sense.  Everything was needlessly dark? Like I just don’t understand?I don’t have a problem with darker books. I think a story can be just as dark and twisted as the author feels it needs to be, as long as it still tells the story well This just seemed to include random gritty details or supppppeeerrr intense descriptions. The main character’s struggle with mental health problems and self-harm (is this a spoiler? It’s pretty evident from the book’s blurb) was never discussed in any sort of nuanced way. Instead, it’s used almost as a plot device to show just how “edgy” this book is. I don’t mind profanity or adult material in adult books. But the over-abundance of it in this book, again, just seemed like it was trying to hard to be gritty or “edgy.” Everything was needlessly sexualized even when the conversations or characters didn’t call for it at that time. This book was too short to be so boring The pace was irrationally languid despite the intense subject matter, and it felt like it took chapters and chapters for the characters to stop just discussing things and for things to actually happen. There’s been a fairly large amount of controversy surrounding the way Gillian Flynn, a self-proclaimed feminist, writes her female characters.You have those who think it’s problematic all of her female characters are such awful people: Like The Huffington Post and others.And then you have those who believe all her characters are horrible people, and that feminism means allowing for female villains and anti-heroes:  Including Flynn herself.  I won’t be touching upon this controversy too much, as I don’t think there’s very much I can say that hasn’t already been discussed. I personally want female villains and anti-heroes who are just as complex as their male counter parts—which I didn’t find in this book where all the characters were so shallow. There were a few things that did seem problematic:-	The main character calls a man a “sexist, liberal lefty practicing sexual discrimination” for believing a drunk woman having sex with an entire football team without her explicit consent was sexual assault. Even when when it was revealed the woman was a minor. -	This entire quote:  “Sometimes I think illness sits inside every woman, waiting for the right moment to bloom. I have known so many sick women all my life. Women with chronic pain, with ever-gestating diseases. Women with conditions. Men, sure, they have bone snaps, they have backaches, they have a surgery or two, yank out a tonsil, insert a shiny plastic hip.”  -	The whole book is filled with the assumption that woman are either so fragile they are sick and broken all the time, or that they just love the attention of being sick. I understand a large part of this was related to the situations Camille was raised in and her mother, but it extended to every other character as well. -	“Women get consumed. Not surprising, considering the sheer amount of traffic a woman's body experiences. Tampons and speculums. Cocks, fingers, vibrators and more, between the legs, from behind, in the mouth.”  WOMEN ARE NOT COMMODITIES THAT GET CONSUMED. The implication that a woman can be ‘run-down’ based off the amount of things she’s had in her orifices is completely disgusting.I guessed whodunit less than halfway through. The reasoning was interesting, though the way it was all revealed match the same odd, explicit tone as the rest of the story.  In Conclusion:  Safe to say, I will not be reading Dark Places."
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,Rating 3 out of 5,"Camille Preaker is a young Chicago reporter with a troubled past. When a second young girl goes missing in her home town, Wind Gap, MO, Camille’s fatherly boss sends her down to get the inside scoop. Who says you can’t go home again? Well, maybe you can, but would you really want to? There is a reason she is in Chicago, instead of Podunk, MO, and the danger for Camille lies as much with her delicate psychological state, a product of her childhood, as it might with a psycho-killer on the loose. ""Qu'est-ce que c'est ?""Wind Gap is home to an array of characters left over from GCB, (Yes, I know it was published before the show) Stepford and Village of the Damned, and mix in a bit of Mommie Dearest and Cruella de Vil. Sounds like fun, no? Sorry to disappoint, but not so much. Gillian Flynn - Image from Orion BooksLess than a year ago a young girl was found dead, floating in a stream, strangled, with her teeth removed. Now a second girl, about the same age, has gone missing and folks are fearing the worst. Well, duh-uh. ‘Ere long the body is found wedged in a foot-wide space between two buildings, sans pearly whites. The game is afoot.Camille has to cope with an uncooperative local Sheriff and then try to get some, any information from the very cute Kansas City detective who had been brought in to help out. Camille is presented as a dish, and there is definite sexual tension between the reporter and the town’s visiting investigator. Ok I really first wrote “between the reporter and the town’s visiting dick”, but my wife (who does not have the mind of a 12 year old boy) shamed me into removing it. Usually she does not see my material until it is on line but had expressed curiosity about the book, so got a preview.Amy Adams as Camille Preaker – image from NY TimesCamille makes the rounds, visiting the families of the victims, reconnecting, for good or ill, with her former schoolmates, most of whom seem never to have heard of the women’s movement. But the largest connection for Camille in Wind Gap is her childhood home, inhabited by her mother, stepfather, and half-sister. Cue thunder and lightning, creepy music, and under the chin lighting. Mom, ironically named Adora, has the warm presence of a guillotine and Camille’s stepfather, Alan, appearing in various costumes, seems to need only a pinky ring and fluffy white lap cat to complete the cartoon. We all know what happens when we return to the houses in which we were raised. We regress. Come on, admit it. We behave like the children we once were. At the very least we feel the tug of those urges. In Camille’s case, her home life was, shall we say, lacking. Her little sister, Marian, had died when Camille was kid. Attempting to cope with that and some other issues, she took to a bit of long-lasting self-destructive behavior. In case the razor on the cover of this book is not obvious enough, Camille is a cutter, or was, anyway. Not just lines, but words. And the words on her skin pop into her mind as she digs into her research and takes on the psychological challenges of her home town. We learn early on that she had spent some time in rehab attempting to overcome her addiction. The Camille we meet here may be scarred, but is trying to carve a less destructive path forward for herself. It is a challenge, and represents a parallel set of mysteries. How did the adolescent Camille reach a place where she felt it necessary to indulge in such harmful behavior? What’s the deal with her family? Camille has to figure out not only the secret of the two murders, but her own history.Eliza Scanlen as Amma CrellinHer background makes it easier for her to relate to her thirteen-year-old stepsister, Amma, who knew both the dead girls. They share some traits. Like Camille as a kid, Amma (a word that usually means “mother”) is a mean-girl group leader, headstrong, bright, and not someone you would ever cross. Amma is physically precocious, and behaviorally far beyond that. She can usually be seen with her girl-pack, laughing at funerals, or, metaphorically, kicking cripples. Adding to the creepshow atmosphere, and keeping the cutting notion sharp, there is a slaughterhouse in town. One particular scene resonated a lot. In the slaughterhouse, sows are positioned on their sides, with absolutely no room to maneuver, and piglets are brought to the captive females to nurse. It is not an inducement to eating bacon. It so happened that I had seen a film, Samsara, the day before reading the book, in which this very scene was shown. In the book, an added element is that a young girl sits and watches this with unnatural pleasure.We learn more about the victims in time, and it is a somewhat fun ride. But every now and then Camille does or says something that makes you shake your jowls like Louis Black approaching a punch line and burble out a WTF? And those moments take one out of the story.Patricia Clarkson as Adora CrellinThere is clear evidence of talent on display. I liked the prefiguring of the opening in which Preaker is looking at her latest story, about a crack-addled mother who abandoned her kids. Mothering figures prominently in the story. Using a slaughterhouse to echo the cutting Camille practices on herself, and maybe some other horrors as well, may have been a bit heavy-handed, but fine, ok. Having Camille carve words into her skin definitely seems over the top to me, a bit of literary license, but fine, ok. I enjoyed the fun noir twang with which Flynn begins her story, but it seemed to fade quite a lot over the course of 254 pages. Fine, ok. And for fun, Camille, who has been known to hoist a few, manages to visit what seems every bar in town. I took it to be a running joke, but I am not 100% certain. Fine, ok. I felt a lot of fine, ok here. There is some sex, a fair bit of sexiness, some serious creepiness, a bit of satisfaction to be had in the procedural elements of finding this out, then that. But while there may have been satiric intent at work, the characters were either too inconsistent, too thinly drawn or even cartoonish to invest much emotionally. Sharp Objects may have been the bleeding edge of Flynn’s career as a novelist, and it is not a bad first cut, but it left me hoping that she would apply her obvious talent with finer lines next time, maybe use some subtler shades and etch more believable characters, give us material we could dig into a little deeper. The images (except for the author’s) are from the HBO mini-series made from the book.=============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author’s personal, Twitter and FB pagesMarch 23, 2013 - GR pal Peg clued us in to a wonderful piece Flynn wrote for Powell's, that goes a way to illuminating her literary choices.

10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/77602709-maria,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.4/5 Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️“The face you give the world tells the world how to treat you.” Wow well this was... disturbing. And sick and twisted and depraved and degenerate. Possibly incest. I liked it! But didn't love it. Prior to reading this book, I had watched the mini series from HBO. And then naturally, I bought the book and didn't read it until now. Yes, the series came out 2 years ago and I'm reading the book in 2020, shut up. But let's talk about it.Camille was a very interesting protagonist to read about. She has a very dark past, a disturbed family, history of violence, abuse and self harm and now after years of not being back to her hometown and having being ""saved"" so to speak, she ends up back in the rabbit hole. Which brings back many bad memories, awkward meetings with old classmates, gossip, and most importantly... a reunion with her toxic mother. I didn't like Camille as a person. She was very unlikable and snobbish to me. But I liked reading about her and delving more into her psyche. Finally a good ""unlikable characters"" book.The storyline was pretty basic, two little girls are killed in a small town... reporter has to go there and write an article about it... but in this case the reporter is from the town. This fucking town man! Is this how people are like in small towns in America? Like honestly, 13 years olds acting like 18 years olds? What the fuck was that about? They could just up the ages a tiny bit... 15 would have been more realistic. Looking like that and acting like that at 13 does not happen often. Maybe they could have done this with Amma only, which yes was the most popular and mean girl in school blah blah blah, but the other girls don't really fall much behind. They are in middle school for God's sake! No. Couldn't buy it. Tell me please, if 13 year olds in America act like this, I truly want to know.The mystery was thrilling but at times it fell flat. There are moments were the plot was backtracking I could say? I can't really explain it but I guess I could say some things felt very repetitive sometimes. Conversations and characters mostly. Also thoughts in Camille's mind and the way she expressed them. Maybe this book could be smaller and it would be more impactful and fast paced.One of my biggest problems with this book was the ending and the ""twist"". The revelation was written in such a weird way that I literally had to go back to my audiobook and book (yes I listen to audiobooks at 2.3 while reading the book too to read faster, trust me it works, especially if you're bilingual) to understand what the fuck just happened. Luckily, I didn't remember the twist from the mini series and when I remembered it I got that ""OH SHIT HOW DID I FORGET THIS"" but the presentation could have been better. It was a good plot twist buried by the writing and presentation.To sum up, this was a good but not great mystery thriller for me. If you enjoy mystery thrillers that depend mostly on abusive relationships and character studies, you will like this a lot more. If you want good world building and a nice plot twist, you won't like it extremely much. And before I go... FUCK THE MOTHER. K bye!"

Shout out to this absolutely fabulous book in my 
 latest booktube video

Sometimes I think illness sits inside every woman, waiting for the right moment to bloom. 
Camille Preaker is back in her hometown but for all the wrong reasons.She just got out of a psych hospital and her next reporting assignment? To cover the murders of two preteens who lived in her town.
Problems always start long before you really, really see them.
She has to live with her mother - who is a piece of work herself. She's neurotic and hypochondriac, always fussing, poking and prodding. Camille's younger sister seems not to mind it but every time Camille is back in town, she can feel her hackles rise. 
I just think some women aren't made to be mothers. And some women aren't made to be daughters.
The longer she spends in this town, the thinner her own grip on reality becomes.
It's impossible to compete with the dead. I wished I could stop trying.
As the victims keep coming, Camille begins to realize that sometimes, some secrets are best kept locked away. Forever. 
Every time people said I was pretty, I thought of everything ugly swarming beneath my clothes.
Whewww.This one was STUNNING. This is the second Flynn book I've ever read and upon a reread, it's still my favorite.Flynn is able to immerse you into her world like no other. The setting was just the right level of hair-raisingly eerie and all of the characters were unsettling in their own, unique way.This is one of those books that you pick up, and you just cannot put it down until you KNOW what the ending is.Sharp Objects really got to me and I cannot wait to read what Flynn writes next!Audiobook CommentsRead by Ann Marie Lee - and she was an absolutely stunning narrator. Her pace and tone just set the scene perfectly. Loved listening to this one!YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads"

And some women aren't made to be daughters.” ― Gillian Flynn, Sharp ObjectsThis is one of the darkest, most disturbing books I've ever read. And I love it. Well, today I love it. I picked it up years ago, started reading and was like ""no way Jose"". I had read Dark Places and Gone Girl and, of course, thought I could handle Sharp Objects, the Gillian Flynn debut. I wasn't ready at the time for this little monster of a book.The extremely creepy plot revolves around a serial killer in a Missouri town, and the reporter who has returned from Chicago to cover the event. Just a few of the themes include dysfunctional families, violence and self-harm. But there is so much more.As I've mentioned before, I've read a lot of blasé, boring domestic noir lately. Give me a book with some meat on its bones! Blake Crouch's Dark Matter got my motor running again and I just couldn't go back to some of those wimpily -made up word written mysteries.If you're caught in a summer stagnation, wake yourself up with this book. It's probably lying on a shelf in your house somewhere. Just prepare yourself. Flynn is an expert ""description writer"" and some of the things she describes are not pretty. At all. As in sick, sick, sick. Yes, the characters are seriously f****d up! I don't need my heroine to be shiny and pristine. Every person in this story has got issues.  Who knows what kind of childhood some people endure? Aren't you curious as to WHY they are weird? I always am!I know some readers are all, ""but, I don't really like the characters, I can't root for anyone..."" Ok, then this book isn't for you. But, I'm telling you, Gillian Flynn is a master at blueprinting the human psyche into a living breathing character that you won't soon, if ever, forget. You'll probably even have a nightmare or two, after all, Stephen King is a huge Flynn fan."
14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana,Rating 4 out of 5,"Update 10/2018Doesn't seem that edgy 8 years later. We are not lacking in female anti-heroes now. The novel and the show complement each other rather well. Liked the neater ending of the book more though, but the show is a visual feast. Interesting how the show creators chickened out and made Amma older, to not offend our sensibilities? Amy Adams is fantastic as Camille.Original reviewIf you ask me which words come into my mind first whenever I think of this book, my answer will be: nasty, dark, twisted, disturbing.In this rather traumatizing psychological thriller Camille Preaker, a troubled newspaper reporter, is sent to her home town to get the inside scoop on the murders of two preteen girls - both were strangled and had their teeth removed. As we follow Camille on her quest to obtain as much information as possible about the crimes, we learn much more than we bargained for. The small town of Wind Gap, in the fashion of Twin Peaks, is filled to the brim with dark secrets, and not the least of them is the twisted dynamics in Camille's own family...For me the most remarkable aspect of this book is that Gillian Flynn succeeds in creating a novel main characters of which are nasty women. I am so used to books where women are victims and all evil is committed by bad, bad men. Not so in Sharp Objects. Women of Wind Gap are both victims and perpetrators, they are promiscuous and abusive, self-destructive and violent. Men are only fixtures in their lives and pawns in their sick games. If anything, this is a refreshing twist on the old tired genre of murder mystery. I liked the psychological aspect of this novel as well. Flynn skillfully portrays how differently people react to the abuse in their lives - some direct the pain onto themselves, some inflict it on others - and both ways are equally damaging to one's psyche.I definitely wouldn't recommend Sharp Objects to squeamish. There is a lot of disturbing stuff in this book - promiscuous young girls, self-mutilation, sexual abuse, drugs. This is not a comfort read by any means. However I found it fascinating (in a I-can't-stop-watching-this-train-wreck way) and hard to put down. I will certainly read Flynn's other novel - Dark Places. Well, as soon as I psychologically recover from Sharp Objects."

This book is dark, really dark. The characters in it are all filled with hatred, violence, and pessimism. The content warnings in it are literally almost all the warnings in the current literary world. You will become incredibly sad while reading this book. Despite all the above negatives, you are going to love this book. The narration is done at a perfect pace. The main characters' character arcs are done brilliantly. The author also discusses some rare medical conditions with meticulous precision, and the ending will satisfy most readers. If you are someone over 18 and are in the right mood to read a dark psychological thriller, this book will be a great choice."

17,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48477217-the-burning-rose-jess,Rating 3 out of 5,"3/5 stars.The book tells of a young reporter named Camille. She escaped from the town where she grew up years ago to break away from the cruel life she lived, and to start a new life.Years later, Camille had to return to the town for the article she needed to publish. Camille, who did everything to disavow this town, found herself returning there unwillingly.I know that in the description of the book, it says it's a murder story. But I wouldn't describe this book that way.True, there were brutal homicides in the town. True, the main character, Camille, is trying to figure out the murder. True, there are detectives, there are investigations. But after all, I wouldn't say the book is about the homicides.The book is about the main character. Her past and present. The book is about this strange and cruel town. The book is surrounding around Camille herself, her family and the town itself.I personally didn't like the book so much. It was... too dumb. Not the book itself tho, but the town. I hate this town. I'm not sure how to explain it, but while reading the book I just... felt bad. Just like that. I had a bad and restless feeling. This town, the people who live in it, the way they live. They are godless. They are cruel. They are hypocrites and liars. It's just so fucking dumb. If I lived there, I probably would’ve committed suicide. And I'm not kidding.And Camille, so broken on the inside, so twisted, so scarred, literally. She was scarred from the moment she was born in this town. But that's exactly the problem - everyone's scarred because of this town.I'm not sure how many stars I really want to give this book. After all, it was pretty interesting. But like I said, this book made me feel so bad. And even after I finished the book - the bad feeling remained there and gave me no rest. The ending was over well, but I personally didn’t feel rested, the book continued to disturb me even after I finished reading it. The only reason this book gets 3 stars and not less, is thanks to Flynn's writing. She writes incredibly, and she deserves a hundred stars just for her writing. "
18,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13266158-samadrita,Rating 2 out of 5,"When I had first come across rave reviews of Gone Girl, I was bowled over by the fact that there's after all a woman who is brave enough to try her hand at a genre rarely ventured into by women writers. And apparently, she excels at it too. Surely, she couldn't have hoodwinked hordes of unsuspecting readers into giving her books such high ratings.So I had decided I'd devour Gillian Flynn's entire oeuvre starting with her first published work. Needless to say, that it is with obvious disappointment I'm giving this book only 2 stars. I had high hopes for Flynn's first published novel.Sharp Objects comes off as a classic case of trying too hard. The set up feels too contrived, the world building, shabby and the writing, unimpressive and awkward. ('bucolicry' Ms Flynn? is that even a real word?) And to heap on to the negatives, Flynn rushes us through the scenery, the murders, the facts with such alarming speed that few things get time enough to make a powerful impact.The eerie, secluded little town of Wind Gap never comes alive for the reader. All the characters appear to be caricatures of stereotypical suspects in a murder mystery novel. Even the central characters seem to be rather blurry outlines of real people instead of full-fledged human beings of flesh and bone. My mind failed at conjuring up even a single image of Wind Gap, its inhabitants or Camille and that's when I knew things were going downhill. After I had made some headway with the book, my attention kept drifting away and this doesn't usually happen with a thriller novel.(Proof of my steadily dwindling interest in thrillers maybe?)Neither did I care about the murders nor did I think much of the disturbing imagery that Flynn shoves right in the reader's face from time to time. Even if you keep the somewhat macabre murders of pubescent girls aside, there are themes of self mutilation, sexual abuse, descriptions of horrific serial killings, slaughtering of pigs and chickens to make you cringe and wince as you read every alternate passage. Still I wasn't repulsed.Instead what I felt acutely was Flynn's desperate desire to create a truly unsettling narrative. You can tell she is trying to offer you a blend of all things gory, disturbing and wicked just to titillate your senses. It's as if the central story became secondary to Flynn somewhere while she was writing this and only the deeply perturbing elements assumed primary importance.Even the ending fails to pack in a punch, because if you have read a slew of whodunits at any point of time in your life, you will sort of guess the culprit. The only part which successfully creeped me out was the protagonist's tendency to inflict injuries on herself as a way to purge herself of emotions. But that one feeling doesn't help you sail through a book which is, otherwise, ceaselessly dreary and simply put, lacklustre in every way.Hence, 2 very unsatisfied, very bored stars.I am holding out hope for Gillian Flynn though. Maybe my opinion will change after reading Gone Girl or Dark Places."

I picked ""Sharp Objects"" to read first when I heard Amy Adams is going to be the leading actress in a drama series. I wasn't expecting so much violence. This is a very dark disturbing story...........but my favorite parts were the psychological aspects of he mother/daughter relationship. When a child has a mother from hell - kinda shapes your life from the 'get-go' and not in a pretty way. I can already see Amy Adams playing the role of reporter Camille Preaker....who returns to her small hometown to cover the murders of two preteen girls. She identifies with the girls a little too closely -- plus she had recently spent a short stay in a psychiatric hospital. Camille is vulnerable- fragile- and flawed. The closer she gets to cracking the case she is working on, the more she begins to crack. Old haunting demons are rising to the surface ...memories of her sister and emotional and physical abuse.

Camille is an amazing protagonist, utterly believable, well drawn, and I related to her far more than makes me feel comfortable admitting. This is a book about darkness and women and Flynn is one of those writers who stares darkness down and goes even darker. Just like Gone Girl, though, the ending is ludicrous. I laughed out loud, because it was just too much. Completely bananas. I figured it out early on and don't mind that it ended where I expected but the last few chapters are just, ""Let's throw everything ridiculous at the reader and see what sticks!""

25,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22943325-maxine-booklover-catlady,Rating 5 out of 5,"Squee! This is coming out on TV on Sky Atlantic. I cannot wait! (2018). I don't know about you, but in my opinion this is WAY better than Gone Girl, I think this one is a hidden gem. It's a lot more subtle but that's why it works more. This is one spine-chilling disturbing and dark book and I absolutely loved it. Some of the scenes in this book literally just stunned me. Very clever writing from Gillian Flynn.When two girls are abducted and killed in Missouri, journalist Camille Preaker is sent back to her home town to report on the crimes. Long-haunted by a childhood tragedy and estranged from her mother for years, Camille suddenly finds herself installed once again in her family's mansion, reacquainting herself with her distant mother and the half-sister she barely knows - a precocious 13-year-old who holds a disquieting grip on the town. As Camille works to uncover the truth about these violent crimes, she finds herself identifying with the young victims - a bit too strongly. Clues keep leading to dead ends, forcing Camille to unravel the psychological puzzle of her own past to get at the story.If you have not read this one yet but have been meaning to, please do it. This sat on my bookshelf for over a year, what a waste, it was one of my most memorable reads of the last few years.Camille, who is a Journalist is sent back to very small town USA where she grew up to get the juice on a story of young women going missing and turning up dead - with their teeth pulled out. Her big Chicago boss is hoping her home connection will give her the inside scoop. The characters in this book are bloody EXCEPTIONALLY done, both Camille's mother and her half-sister, Amma are some of the best written, most disturbing characters I have read in a book in ages. I had goose bumps with both of them, a lot of goose bumps. Did I say this book has a dark overtone?Camille is a flawed and damaged character, what you see is not always what you are seeing, I really grew to like her and her tenacity for the truth no matter what the cost. Once she gets it, it changes everything. Amma got under my skin in a very uncomfortable way, Flynn portrays her in a way that makes an impact on your psyche.The town doesn't just welcome Camille in and for a while nobody is talking but she is determined to keep digging and what she uncovers is just wrong, so wrong, so darn wrong. Is she even on the right path? Can she see clearly what is right before her eyes.With scenes (pig farm) that just churn you inside and sentences spoken that literally make the temperature drop in your body, this one has subtle yet so blatant shock factors all the way through it. It creates atmospheres that you feel part of from awkwardness to sheer terror. I could not put this book down because each bit rolls into the next and I had to know what was really going on. Just who is taking these girls and killing them so brutally? The whole town believes it's one of their own and everybody has their theory, fingers are pointing everywhere. In the uncovering of the truth Camille is forced to face demons from her past. For me this is a 5 star read because I won't forget it, I devoured it and could not put it down, it's well written and it's cleverly done. LOOK! I asked for this way back and this year, 2018 it’s going to be on Sky Atlantic! I wish they had made this one into a movie instead of Gone Girl, would have been so much darker on the screen."
26,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani,Rating 4 out of 5,"Sharp Objects, Gillian FlynnSharp Objects is the 2006 debut novel by American author Gillian Flynn. The novel follows Camille Preaker, a small newspaper journalist, who must return to her hometown to report on a series of brutal murders. She is not particularly satisfied with the job, which includes writing stories about human neglect and crimes such as murder. Camille gets along somewhat well with her boss Curry, who supported her during a recent hospitalization due to self-harm. Camille has carved many words onto her body—having previously hallucinated them on her skin. Curry gives her a reporting assignment to her hometown of Wind Gap, Missouri, where one girl has been murdered and a second is missing. Once in Wind Gap, Camille manages to gain some information about the crimes from the townspeople, including the family of Ann Nash, the murdered girl. The local police are not particularly forthcoming about the murder, but the town sheriff divulges to Camille off the record that he believes that the murderer is a Wind Gap native, not a stranger. Soon the body of the missing girl, Natalie Keene, is discovered in an alley in town. Both she and Ann were strangled, and had all of their teeth removed. Camille publishes a story, only for Curry to ask her to remain in Wind Gap for further coverage of the murders. ....تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و چهارم ماه آگوست سال2017میلادیعنوان: چیزهای تیز؛ نویسنده: گیلین فلین؛ مترجم: مهدی فیاضی کیا؛ تهران، چترنگ؛ سال1395، در347ص؛ شابک9786009594221؛ چاپ دوم سال1397؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده امریکا - سده21معنوان: چیزهای تیز (اشیای نوک تیز)؛ نویسنده: گیلین فلین؛ مترجم: سمیه کرمی؛ تهران، میلکان؛ سال1395، در250ص؛ شابک9786007845554؛عنوان: چیزهای تیز؛ نویسنده: گیلین فلین؛ مترجم: سحر بستام؛ تهران: پادینا، سال‏‫‬‏1397؛ در338ص؛ شابک9786008588672؛چیزهای تیز، نخستین رمان از نویسنده ی امریکایی «گیلین فلین» است، که نخستین بار در روز بیست و ششم ماه سپتامبر سال2006میلادی، انتشاراتی «شی آرهارت بوکس» منتشر و سپس همین کتاب توسط «برودوی بوکس» بازنشر شد؛ داستان رمان درباره ی «کمیل (کامیله) پریکر» روزنامه نگاری است، که برای گزارش قتل‌های وحشیانه به زادگاه خویش برمیگردد؛ شخصیتهای داستان «کمیل (کامیله) پریکر»: روزنامه نگاری جوان که سعی دارد در «شیکاگو» زندگی خوبی برای خود بسازد؛ «اما»: خواهر ناتنی و سیزده ساله ی «کمیل (کامیله)»، که او هم زندگی دوگانه ای دارد؛ «آدورا»: مادر «کمیل» و «اما»، که زنی سختگیر است و به نسبت به «کمیل» بی احساس، و با «اما» همچو عروسک رفتار می‌کند؛ او خانواده بسیار ثروتمندی دارد و صاحب بسیاری از کسب و کارهای شهر استنقل از متن: (یکبار در یک گوشه‌ ی سرد «شیکاگو»، پشت چراغ قرمز منتظر ایستاده بودم، که مرد نابینایی عصازنان به من نزدیک شد؛ پرسید: این کدام چهارراه است؟ و وقتی جواب ندادم، برگشت و پرسید: کسی این‌جا هست؟ گفتم: من این‌جا هستم، و آن کلمه‌ ها به‌ طرز غریبی آرامش‌بخش به نظر رسیدند؛ وقتی هول می‌کنم، این کلمه‌ ها را، با صدای بلند، به خودم می‌گویم؛ من این‌جا هستم؛ معمولاً احساس حضور ندارم؛ گویی همین حالاست که همراه باد گرمی محو شوم، باد مرا با خود ببرد و برای همیشه ناپدید کند، و حتا تکه‌ ناخنی هم از من به‌ جا نگذارد؛ روزهایی هست که با این فکر از درون گرم می‌شوم، و روزهایی هم باعث می‌شود یخ کنم؛ گمانم دلیلِ این احساس بی‌وزنی ناشی از این ا‌ست، که بسیار‌ کم درباره‌ ی گذشته‌ ی خودم می‌دانم؛ یا حداقل حرف‌ روان‌کاوهای توی بیمارستان این بود؛ خیلی وقت است که از تلاش برای شناختن پدرم، دست کشیده‌ ام، وقتی تلاش می‌کنم او را تصور کنم، تصویری عام از «پدر» در ذهنم شکل می‌گیرد؛ نمی‌توانم با جزئیات درباره‌ اش فکر کنم؛ مثلاً نمی‌توانم تصور کنم که برای خرید بیرون رفته باشد، یا صبح‌ها، مشغول نوشیدن یک فنجان قهوه است، یا عصرها از سرِ کار برمی‌گردد؛ ممکن است روزی دختری را ببینم که شبیه من باشد؟ وقتی بچه بودم تلاش می‌کردم بین خودم و مادرم شباهتی پیدا کنم؛ مثلاً چیزی که ثابت کند من بچه‌ ی او هستم؛ وقتی حواسش به من نبود، چهره‌ اش را بررسی می‌کردم؛ قاب‌ عکس‌های اتاقش را کش می‌رفتم، و تلاش می‌کردم به خودم ثابت کنم، چشم‌های او را دارم؛ یا شاید شباهت در چهره نبود؛ شاید ساق پایم شبیه ساق پای او بود، یا مثلاً انحنای گردنم!)؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 06/03/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ 13/01/1401هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

I wasn't in the mood, and it was irritating. Also, I couldn't enjoy the main character. I found the scene where she was 12 years old and in someone's hunting shed, full of dead, bloody animals and porn irritating. I get that I was supposed to think ""oh wow what a messed up home life she has to be masturbating in a shed full of dead animals"", but instead I thought "" I have no interest in this, or her."""

Camille got under my skin, zero pun intended, and I enjoyed the whole ride. Whilst graphic, I wasn’t bothered, and whilst dark this was fine too. I was impressed with the writing of this book and understand why this author has hit it off worldwide.Camille is a very troubled young woman, a mediocre journalist and a recovering cutter. Self harming herself in the most dreadful way, by inscribing words into her skin. All over her body. She returns begrudgingly to her home town that is probably only good at one thing, for churning out pork meat and alcoholics. The people in the town seem to be a mess, the teenagers horrible, and let’s not forget Ms. Horrible little sister. For as much as she was troubled herself, she did try to help and nurture her in some way. This girl was too far gone to hope for any type of redemption. The women who grew from teens that Camille grew up with are equally as horrendous.Camille’s mother was a loveless soulless woman who had a strange marriage with a horribly boring man called Allan. Upon this homecoming we see Camille struggle with returning to this hell hole and trying to piece together a child serial killing situation. This just seems nearly impossible for her to do as she relives memories from losing her own little sister many moons ago. Absorbing reading, hateful characters and lovely ones too. I really did love John, the out of town Detective Richard and most of all the lovely Camille who it seems was facing her own redemption by the end. Silly me for leaving this author on my shelf for too long!"

And some women aren't made to be daughters.""Journalist Camille Preaker is sent back to her hometown, where one girl has been brutally murdered and another one is missing.Dark and twisty and fucked up characters are my FAVE, and Gillian Flynn seems to be the absolute queen of creating them. Although one of the issues with having such car crashes for human beings in your stories is that you often don't have a character who you really root for or relate to. Usually I like having this sort of character in my books, but sometimes reading a book just for the sake of getting engrossed in the storyline and disentangling all the threads running throughout is all you need! Also known as… the perfect poolside read - which this was for me.I'm a huge fan of Flynn's writing. Some of her descriptions and prose really wow-ed me. One woman she described as having ""hips like antlers"" in the way that the bones jutted out, and I just really liked that simile. There were a lot more instances like this where I would read a sentence or a paragraph and think ""Oooh, that's GOOD!"" I also loved a lot of the dark imagery that she included, it felt like quite a visual book and some of the scenes created will leave a lasting impression for sure.Sharp Objects is full of twists and turns, a few of which I had predicted before they happened, but there were still a few that surprised me. The ending in particular! I thought I had it figured out, then it went one way and then another and I was just like WOOOAAHHH this is awesome.Although that's not to say I had some issues. One of my major annoyances with this book was that it was extremely over sexualised at times. I am not a prude by any means, but it just felt like everything had links to sex in some way. EVERYTHING. And a lot of the time it seemed completely needless and tacked on. One event in particular… which I can't really talk about as I never include spoilers in a review, but it involved Camille's relationship with someone and it was just… completely unnecessary. In my view, anyway.ALSO, also. I just do not buy that Amma is 13 years old! I just don't. I can completely understand that some kids are very mature and almost behave like adults at such a young age, but 13 was a bit of a stretch. Especially when you go on to watch the TV adaptation. I'm just not buying it, maybe 15 years old would be more believable? Some of Camille's opinions also rubbed me up the wrong way (that phrase would totally be made into some kind of innuendo in the book *rolls eyes*). In particular, there was one part where she discusses how women get ""consumed"" due to the ""sheer amount of traffic"" a woman's body experiences. I understand that this is merely Camille's opinion and I can't hold that against the book itself but the implication of it just grated on me.That actually sounds like I had a lot of issues… but I still enjoyed the story a lot!! It's a page turner and it was exactly what I needed for my holiday.4 stars."

I’ve returned to my childhood, the scene of the crime.

Part Southern gothic horror, part murder mystery, part domestic thriller. Sharp Objects is a brilliant book. I loved it even though I didn’t enjoy the experience of reading it—it left me very uncomfortable and disturbed.Pretty much every content warning I can think of applies to this book, so please heed the warnings before you wade in. The book focuses heavily on themes of murder, child abuse, sexual violence, and all other kinds of violence. 

“Sometimes if you let people do things to you, you’re really doing it to them. If someone wants to do fucked-up things to you, and you let them, you’re making them more fucked up. Then you have the control.”

Camille, a Chicago reporter, returns to her claustrophobic hometown in rural Missouri to report on the murders of two young girls. Her unreliable narration, made worse by lots of substance abuse and trauma, colors the story until you’re never quite sure you can trust anything anyone tells you.I was never really on my side in any argument. I liked the Old Testament spitefulness of the phrase got what she deserved. Sometimes women do.The horror is there from the very first page. Gillian Flynn’s writing is incredibly evocative; she’s a master at setting the tone with descriptive language. Even if not a single bad thing had happened in the entire book, it still would have left me feeling unsettled and horrified. 

She smiled leeringly again and clicked her round brown eyes open and shut. She reminded me of a ventriloquist dummy come alive. With hard skin and broken capillaries.

Highly recommend from a literary perspective but this book is not for the faint of heart."
33,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27544490-annemarie,Rating 4 out of 5,"I really liked Gone Girl, but was quite disappointed by Dark Places, so I had absolutely no idea what I would think about this book. I'm happy to report that this one was another win for me! It was a super easy and fast read with a solid plot and interesting characters. In fact, I think the main character Camille is my favorite one out of all the ones Gillian Flynn has created over the years. Some actions of hers seemed a bit too hectic (?) for me though; I couldn't understand why the author decided to write some (to the plot completely unnecessary ) scenes involving her in there. These scenes didn't really line up with the rest of her character traits. On the other hand, this also kind of fit in with Camille's overall personality. So I didn't mind this too much.However, I did have a bigger problem with the portrayal of her little sister Amma. I feel like she acted way to mature for her age. Sure, some teens grow up faster than others, but she seemed a bit too ""out there"" for my liking. At some points I was even questioning if maybe Camille (who narrates this novel) just majorly exaggerated her behavior and that this would somehow tie into the story. Since this wasn't the case though, it's hard for me to view Amma as a realistic character. But maybe I'm just too much of a prude to believe that someone like her would actually exist...The topic that gets dealt with is very interesting, but also very heavy. Too heavy, in my opinion, to wrap up in such a short amount of pages. Some deeper explanation and exploration would have been needed for a deeper impact. Everything wrapped up a bit too easy and quickly in the end.It was still shocking and highly entertaining though, which made this a great thriller to pass some time."
34,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Terrific book, truly creepy. A page turner about a journalist going back to her tiny Missouri home town to cover the recent murders of two little girls. Gillian Flynn's writing in Entertainment Weekly has always been a notch above, and her first novel is no disappointment.What's remarkable about this book is that it focuses on some of the most damaged and interesting women I've ever seen in fiction. Strong women in fiction usually means one of three things:1) Ass-kickers in fantastic outfits that talk, think and fight like men (think Tarantino)2) Delicate little homebodies with surprising reserves of strength when needed (think Jane Austen)3) Raging bitches (think Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada)What's great about the women here is that they don't really fit into any of the above categories. They're conniving, manipulative, sweet, deeply insecure, fierce and hopelessly crippled people whose flailing at one another feels very real and very scary. Great book."

“Sometimes if you let people do things to you, you're really doing it to them.”
It's freaky and twisted. It's terrifying and compelling. You'll sit down, grab the book and read it until you've reached the last page. No kiddings here. I read this in one sitting, no pause for water, no pause whatsoever. It'll creep you out and fascinate you and you'll connect with the story on many levels. I did. I connected with the character and I'm still having nightmares about it.By all accounts, this is a Gillian Flynn novel. Having read all of her books now, I can safely say that she has a very dark mind. I cannot for the life of me understand how someone can put so much fucked-up in less than 300 pages. She will take the safest of things. The one thing everyone considers safe and regular, and she'll twist and turn it until there's a monster made out of it. I don't know if it's a curse or a talent. Dark Places &  Gone Girl were amazing, incredible. They both left me wanting for more. But this one really did the job from me. I was fascinated from the first page till the very last hence the five stars.I think what mainly got to me was the fact that this book had a main character who was full of weaknesses and sensitivities. Camille has about one hundred insecurities and has only ever known hurt and betrayal and not for once in her life has she felt loved. And I mean, never. Not when she was a baby, not while she was growing up and certainly not now. In comparison with Mrs. Flynn's two other books, whose characters are more tough and more independent and sure of themselves and are just bad bad people, this one pictures a character who every reader can connect with and feel for and maybe identify themselves with.Camille Preaker is a reporter, coming back from a psych ward she throws herself at her job. That's it until her boss sends her to her hometown where there seems to be a serial killer on the loose and has yet to be covered by the media. Her hometown is really secluded, not in the way of no nearby cities and that shit but in the way of secrets having the tendency to never get out of the town. People there turn their heads around when something bad is happening, denying having ever seen it. Is a girl having sex with 4 boys at plain sight and a neighbor sees it? No, it didn't happen. People have a short-term memory, like goldfish. Having lost her younger sister at the age of 13 and having never known motherly or fatherly love, Camille was a teenage girl who'd let anyone take advantage of her. She'd harm herself in more than one way. She'd do it over and over again. No stopping. What's terrifying is seeing the world through Camille's eyes. She chooses to see the best in people even when they haven't given her a reason to do so. That's what really got her to where she is, in the first place. Dark is a word to characterize this book, twisted is another. The killings go way deeper that what you'll first imagine and think another ""solve the mystery"" novel. After every book of Mrs. Flynn I read I feel insecure and have a feeling of dirt, not the physical kind but the mental one. No shower will ever rid me of it."
36,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/236411-steve,Rating 4 out of 5,"The next two paragraphs give my review of this book, but if the only reason you’d be tempted to read on is to hear about the time I “met” Gillian Flynn, you can scroll past them.Like so many other Goodreaders seduced by the buzz, I read and enjoyed every sharp bend of Gone Girl. It proved to be something of an archetype, too, with books like The Girl on the Train and The Woman in the Window cashing in on similar threats and thrills. If you’re looking for even better correlation, though, go backwards in Flynn’s own oeuvre to this one. (Please allow me a quick aside to express an unreasonable but intense dislike for that word—oeuvre. When I try to sound it out in my head, that trailing “re” throws me, like Brett Favre’s name did to the people in Something About Mary. Plus, when I try to Frenchify that opening diphthong, my internal ear hates how affected it sounds. Sorry, I guess I needed to get that off my chest.)Anyway, Sharp Objects has the same kind of feel to it as her famous bestseller. There are vivid descriptions, enough interior life written into the characters that you imagine you know them, and a screenwriter’s gift for how to set a scene. This one pulls a few surprises, too. (With some people, you come to expect the unexpected, right?) It also gives you a proper fear of Wind Gap, Missouri, where investigative journalist Camille Preaker grew up. She was working in Chicago but then returned to Wind Gap to uncover whatever she could about two girls, one murdered and the other missing. She and a police detective / love interest gathered details about the crimes which were pretty intriguing by themselves. But it was the human interest angles that gave it real life. We get a surfeit of dysfunction with this one: boozing, self-mutilation, and a rather exotic psychological syndrome.As it turns out, I had a brief encounter with Ms. Flynn’s dark side in real life about two years ago. I came away thinking her characters come by their edginess honestly. It happened when we were living in Chicago. I’d taken to looking up semi-famous residents on the internet and then jogging by their addresses, mostly just to see what their places were like, but also on the off-chance of spotting them in person. I knew where the Blackhawks’ Jonathan Toews lived, John Cusack’s building was an easy trot away, and I could locate plenty of others from business, politics, sports and the arts. Anyway, it was a cool evening in Flynn’s Lincoln Park neighborhood. I’d been by her place before—very nicely kept, tucked away behind lots of trees and a fence. In the leafless part of the year you could get a view of the house itself. That night I saw a light on and heard music, so even though I knew I probably shouldn’t, I decided to stop for a closer look. I had my hands on the iron rails of her fence, peeking in, when all of the sudden from out of nowhere something grabbed hard at my loose sleeve. It was a large, no-nonsense dog that looked to be somewhere on the Doberman - Rottweiler spectrum. Of course I pulled back right away, but he’d gotten his teeth stuck in the cloth and wasn’t about to let go. I kept yanking to no avail. My heart rate, already elevated from the run, must have doubled again. The dog, meanwhile, was growling loudly enough that Flynn came out to investigate. I wished she would have called the brute off right away, but instead she said with imposing authority, “What the hell are you doing here?”“Nothing,” I said. (Quick thinker, me.)“Well, this is private property.”“I wasn’t trying to do anything. I was just out for a run,” I said.“Seems like you’re stalking me. Do you know who I am?” I wasn’t sure if it was daggers or machetes she was staring at me. Something sharp in any case. Also she was wearing a low-cut sweater showcasing a necklace with a razor blade pendant. “Yeah,” I said, “you’re Gillian Flynn, right? The writer?” Only I messed up her name and pronounced it with a J sound.“You don’t know me well, obviously. It’s Gillian,” she said, hitting the “guh” sound hard, as in Gone Girl.“Oh, right, I should have known.” Then I thought there was a remote chance I could turn this around. “But hey, I really liked your book.”By this time Satan’s Little Helper or whatever the dog's name was had relaxed his clench so I could take back my sleeve.“OK, so you are some kind of celebrity stalker,” she said. “Pathetic. And a fool to boot. You need to get the fuck outta my yard.”With that she marched back inside. Then her dog looked over as if to say, “Take it from me, buddy, you do NOT want to get on her bad side.” I never did run by that house again. I’ll tell you what I did do, though, if you’re curious. I continued a tradition today that I started years ago with this April Fools’ Day prank post. I never did meet Gillian Flynn (though I really did run by her house once or twice). For all I know, she’s much nicer than that. At least I think she may be.  "

Grippin’ book!

WHERE EVERYTHING STARTED
Gillian Flynn is one of the most worldwide famous and popular authors nowadays with best-selling novels like Gone Girl and Dark Places, along with the short story The Grownup, but her debut novel was this one, Sharp Objects.Flynn’s style features broken characters, nasty acts, gruesome crimes and plot twists, showing a face of American contemporary towns (not matter if they’re ficticious) that it’s not so common portraited……and a truly grippin’ narrative.Maybe in this first book, and due precisely being her initial publication, I didn’t feel her attempts for plot twisting as successful as in her following works. Since in this novel are too obvious (at least to me), but still a great novel to read, thanks to Flynn’s narrative. So, while it didn’t gave so much surprises as in her other books (that I read before this one), still, her narrative style is so enriching to read, that I appreciate a lot the actual reading experience.Definitely a 
sharp
 reading experience indeed!It’s quite interesting how Gillian Flynn is able to “sell” us broken characters as the “heroes” of her books, since if you ponder about them, they’re not nice people (or are they just real people?) where they’re not truly evil, but neither are completely good, always walking in a very grey path where you can’t predict what they’ll do next, and since you can read their thoughts, they can’t lie to you, they may lie to other characters in the stories, but the reader is able to fully grasp the souls and conscience of the main protagonists......and while you're aware that they're not nice on taboo and/or politically correct subjects, you still develop a bond with the protagonists, you may not think like them, but get to understand why they think in the way that they think, due the enviroments where they grew up and the traumatic experiences that they've suffered.And you have to respect Gillian Flynn since she’s a bold writer that don’t hesitate of being non-politically correct when her characters express their particular points of view about everything, and indisputably resolute of using the darkest deeds that human beings can do to other human beings.And everything started here.
WELCOME (BACK) TO WIND GAP
Camille Preaker is a young journalist specialized in the crime beat of the Chicago’s newspaper, where she works, and she’s assigned to cover a possible serial killer operating at her hometown, Wind Gap, Missouri……but Camille left the town for good reasons, she is still experiencing very personal traumatic after effects for her living there, and she hoped never come back.Against her best judgement, Camille is the prodigal daughter of Wind Gap, but hardly she is truly welcomed in her own home, where Adora, her strict mother, and Amma, her volatile stepsister, each giving to Camille, their own particular kind of “greetings”, finding herself in the middle of their mischievous games, making to remember to Camille why she left several years ago.Wind Gap’s Police Department doesn’t want to admit that a serial killer is in town, but a young girl murdered and another missing (which most likely will appear dead soon), it’s becoming harder and harder to avoid the gruesome scenario and the worse thing……it’s very likely that the serial killer is one of Wind Gap’s citizens.Wind Gap’s Police Department received the external support of a Kansas City PD’s homicide detective, and soon he started a mutually beneficial relationship with Camille, where she tells him without much constraint the real dark history of Wind Gap.Camille tries her best to investigate the case at her old hometown, interviewing the affected families for the crimes and any witness of the acts, but she left Wind Gap, so many time ago, that almost nobody sees her as a fellow neighbor anymore……and her unavoidable status of being part of one of the most influential Wind Gap’s families isn’t clear to Camille if it’s an advantage or a burden for her journalistic task.However, Camille can’t stop since she may be the only hope to stop Wind Gap’s blood shedding."

She moved north to Chicago and became a reporter for the Daily Post. She had always been a writer of sorts, cutting words with sharp objects into her skin as a permanent record. Each word tingled with the memory of a painful childhood scar, like the death of her sickly and beloved younger sister, Marian. Turns out, not a lot had changed in Wind Gap since Camille left. Young girls were still dying. With Camille's connection to the small town, her newspaper sends her back “home"" in hopes she will break the story that leads to the serial killer’s identity. Dormant words on Camille's skin awake with her return because the darkest of secrets hide behind the Victorian, Southern charm of Wind Gap. Will Camille unravel their truth before another girl dies or the past ensnares her?  THOUGHTS…I gave SHARP OBJECTS five stars because of its amazing plot. I did not accurately guess the murderer! Kudos to the author for that! Without the twisty plot that kept me glued to learning the truth, the book probably wouldn't have worked for me. Personally, I want to like a story’s protagonist and unfortunately, I didn't really like anyone in this story. Take Camille: the author made her narrative so raunchy and crude at times, that it threw me out of the story, and I don't consider myself a prude. Here's an example. Camille went to interview the father of one of the murdered girls. The house is a mess, as one might expect after a tragedy. The only clean room left is a bedroom, so the father takes Camille there to talk. Here's Camille's internal thoughts: “We could have been day players in an amateur porn flick.”And then… “He needed no foreplay for the interview, and I was grateful. It's like sweet-talking your date when you both know you're about to get laid.”Really? Camille’s thinking about a porn analogy when interviewing a grieving father whose child had been murdered and all of her teeth had been removed? Seriously?And the author could not resist the foreign pubic hair tactic to incite a gag. “Someone else’s pubic hair floated by.” Well, thank you very much for sharing.Finally, there are a lot of stickiness, vomiting, and bodily smells in this book. I was like ... Gillian Flynn, PLEASE let Camille take a normal shower/bath to clean herself for once! LOL!!!QUICKFIRE RATINGS from 1 (ugh) to 5 (woo-hoo)…Plot (the story): 5Main character’s likability: 2Likability of supporting character(s): 2Setting(s): 5Pacing (how fast did I turn the pages): 5Believability of story: 5Satisfying ending: 5Tension of story: 5Stirs the heart (romantic elements): 1Did I solve the mystery/guess the ending before the reveal?

I kept waiting for something to start up, or some past mystery to unfold/resolve, but nothing. It was just a story about cruelty and the heartlessness and boredom of women and girls living ""it up"" in small town Midwest. The narrator, now a Chicago reporter, returns to her hometown, Wind Gap, MO, on the tail of a young girl's disappearance. Camille, the narrator, used to cut words into her skin as teenager, starting after the death of her 9 year old sister, and also because their mother was cold and unloving. Almost near the end, some ""plot"" is tacked on the that mother is that way because of Munchausen by Proxy Syndrome, and that she killed Camille's sister, and is using that syndrome to make adult Camille and Camille's 13 year old half-sister sick. The whole novel is about nothing but horrible cruelty by girls and tons of repressed sexual energy. I didn't like it. And I hated the way it was ""resolved"". It reminded me way too much of ""Isabella Moon"", which also meandered insanely and never had a real plot or resolution. "

I actually saw the tv show before I read this so I knew about all the major twists, but I still love the way they are written. This book is a lot darker than I could have even imagined it, something about Gillians way with words in this, it’s really horrifying to read about certain things in this. Even though I wasn’t a super huge fan of the story itself, you can’t deny that the writing in this story is just damn good.

I’m gonna watch the show tonight and I have a feeling it’s gonna be good (it has got Amy Adams playing Camille).Anyway.. back to the book. This was not my usual cup of tea. I watch this kind of movie but I don’t read the books because words affect me differently than watching it play on a screen. It felt raw, so raw. Moody, dark, real are just a few other attributes to attach to this story. I’m not gonna get into the plot, there’s plenty of other reviews that do a play by play and it’s important to read some before diving in. This book is not for the faint of heart. It’s not like it’s horror or anything like that, but it was pretty horrific in the sense that it excavated the sickness of human nature. It was unhealthy, and it left me feeling weird, disoriented and now I need a happy, hopeful type of book to wash this one off. I would recommend it. For all it’s nasty and dark content, it was so well written. The story, the characters.. it was just good. Really good! I don’t feel particularly inspired to write any more details on this, maybe I just need to sit on it for awhile, but I think I made my point, which is : Read this! "

“I just think some women aren't made to be mothers. And some women aren't made to be daughters.” 
I see what you did there, Gillian Flynn. Very clever. You say women are meant for motherhood? Well, let's play with that shit. Let's play with it good.
My mother finally was handed the baby, and she cuddled it ferociously. [...]She pressed her lips hard against the baby's apple slice of a cheek. Then she opened her mouth just slightly, took a tiny bit of flesh between her teeth, and gave it a little bite. 
You say the majority of serial killers are men? Let's add some equality to that:
""It is sort if a wild story, you know? A crazy lady snatches Natalie in broad daylight,"" he said. ""Besides, why would a woman do something like that?""""Why would a man do something like that?"" I asked.""
You say women are weak, innocent creatures, like some women's rights activists did in the 1950s and that is why they require shorter working days and maternity leave? Think again.
“And sometimes drunk women aren't raped; they just make stupid choices--and to say we deserve special treatment when we're drunk because we're women, to say we need to be looked after, I find offensive.” 
I once read a study that compares how boys and girls interact during playtime when with the same sex. Boys are more aggressive and enjoy having pissing contests. Girls tend to keep the peace and use more polite terms when correcting wrongs. The author criticizes past research that states girls act that way because they're such good, innocent creatures. No, they're polite and inclusive to win popularity points. We get so caught in feminism lite and getting rid of the wicked-witch caricature that we forget women can be wicked witches sometimes. There are good men, and there are bad men. As such, there are good women, and there are bad women. Gillian said it best on her website:
“I particularly mourn the lack of female villains — good, potent female villains. Not ill-tempered women who scheme about landing good men and better shoes (as if we had nothing more interesting to war over), not chilly WASP mothers (emotionally distant isn’t necessarily evil), not soapy vixens (merely bitchy doesn’t qualify either). I’m talking violent, wicked women. Scary women. Don’t tell me you don’t know some. The point is, women have spent so many years girl-powering ourselves — to the point of almost parodic encouragement — we’ve left no room to acknowledge our dark side.”
Sharp Objects is a story of bad women. Wicked daughters, wicked stepsisters, and wicked mothers.And yes, it's feminist."

This book features Camille Preaker, an alcoholic, an ex-institutionalised mental patient and a current reporter for the fourth largest paper in Chicago, the Daily Post. Camille's editor, a man named Curry, almost an Uncle figure to Camille, hears of a child disappearing in the small town of Wind Gap where the previous year a girl had been murdered. Curry believes that with the 'right' story both the paper and Camille as a journalist will get noticed.... So what better than to send Camille, an ex-resident of Wind Gap, to her home town, where she can report on the murder and a possible serial killer?However, Camille's home life is dark, and she really doesn't want to revisit her tragic past. Set with the low budget of the paper, Camille is forced to stay at her childhood home with her hypochondriac Mother, Adora, and her chameleon of a sister, Amma- a trouble maker or a little girl? The deeper Camille investigates and stays in Wind Gap, the more inevitable it is for her to be pulled back into the memories of her damaged childhood. The investigation and memories get her skin burning, if only she could scratch at the surface and discover the ugly truth.This book was dark, alluring, twisty and stylish. I loved Camille Preaker as a character with her imperfections and flaws, but also tenacity to discover the truth no matter how ugly it is. I enjoyed the complex psychologies, especially those of the female characters in this book which drew me completely in to the story, and placed me inside their disturbing minds."

When I say good, I mean that I could not put this nauseating, disingenuous piece of shit down, even though I really wanted to. Clearly Flynn could have written a very good book. Instead of reaching for art, she reached for sales, and she got them. She also got raves from Stephen King and several other popular writers who, like him, used the adjective ""nasty"" to praise the book. Apparently that's a compliment now.Flynn was smart enough to figure out that the only way a woman could get top sales in the psychological thriller genre would be to write a book in which all the major female characters except the pathetic and infantilized protagonist are vicious and sociopathic.Ka-ching.Cruelty is fetishized here. The importance of kindness is given lip service, but the only characters who are kind are flat as pop left out for three days. The cruel characters are carefully and lovingly formed, complex and intensely human.Reading this book was like watching a scavenger meticulously pull bits of flesh off a piece of road kill. I guessed whodunnit in the first twenty pages.On the up side, the vivid descriptions of the pig farm have made it impossible for me to continue to eat meat."

The ""heroine"" (and I use this term loosely) was completely unlikeable.

I realize the heroine had a totally messed up childhood but I could not even pity her! She did not have one redeeming quality! The author should have concentrated more on making the storyline/plot disturbing instead of the characters. There was not one likable character throughout! The alcoholism was off the charts! This book had potential but was completely ruined by the characters. It rambled on & on & on about meaningless nothing! (alcohol, drugs, weird sex) I have enjoyed books that have a lot of the previous (alcohol, drugs, & sex) but this was just plain weird. The author's writing style was not bad & something (I'm not sure what) kept me reading until the bitter end. I would not recommend this book to anyone.

Fast-paced, with a lot of interesting female characters, which is a rarity in modern literature, and a lot dark questions asked. While playing with morbidity and clichés, it never fails to surprise you. With a plain and direct writing style, Flynn shines brightly. A year and half after reading this, I changed my rating to 5 stars, because this book is a true masterpiece. Camille, a reporter in Chicago, comes from a small town and a dysfunctional family. She lost her younger sister when she was 13 and that is when she started cutting herself. You'd think that now when she's all grown up and looking out for herself, she would've worked out most of her psychological problems, but she hasn’t and that fact is shown all over her body. Camille has words on almost every inch of her body that she has been cutting into herself over the last 14 years.After spending some time in a mental hospital she comes back to her hometown to investigate the murders of two 10 year old girls for the newspaper she's working for. Unfortunately,she must deal with the death of her sister again and try to objectively find some exclusive information. She comes from a twisted and cruel family tree - her grandmother Joya with her sick and overprotective behaviour ruined her mother Adora, while Adora with her own share of coldness and squeamish behaviour ruined Camille and both of her sisters Marian and Amma. Camille tries to get along with the mother who never loved her and establish a relationship with the half sister she hardly knows. A half-sister she couldn't even recognize. As the story continues, we find so much about Camille's childhood and her behavior as a teenager. She's covered in so many layers you can't put her into any category. I thought I figured out the ending half way through but Flynn made the ending a jaw dropping one. This book is more than just a plot driven story. Yes, I was wondering who the killer is, but much of the story is about Camille's own issues and how she deals with them upon returning home. I love how Flynn portrays women. She definitely brings something new to contemporary fiction. Women here aren't weak, undecided and two-dimensional, but manipulative, too intelligent for their own good and wicked.In a world where we still have to justify the need for feminism, this book takes a completely different approach. Women aren't shown as helpless victims, instead they're initiators and villains. Society is so used to blaming men for everything bad that happens, but sometimes women can be just as horrible. I loved reading about the bond between the characters and how their personalities were influenced by insanity that seems to run in the family. Flynn created flawed characters that we can empathise with even though it's so hard to love them. They're deeply insecure, fierce and broken women whose destructive emotions have tragic consequences. At 95%, I thought I already knew who the murderer is. Even better, I was even DISAPPOINTED because I have figured it all out so early. While other writers begin to wrap up the story so near the end, Flynn was just getting warmed up to slap us with a few more twists. This book is impeccable from first to the last page.  “Sometimes I think illness sits inside every woman, waiting for the right moment to bloom. I have known so many sick women all my life. Women with chronic pain, with ever-gestating diseases. Women with conditions. Men, sure, they have bone snaps, they have backaches, they have a surgery or two, yank out a tonsil, insert a shiny plastic hip. Women get consumed.”  I can't describe how much I love the portrayal of women in this book. Of course, they're not shown in the best light, but it's so refreshing to read about female psychology without any man messing with their minds. Other Flynn's books have the same kind of suspense but don't come near to the perfection of this one. As flawed and broken as Camille is, I still adored her. At least most of the time. Well, except that one time when she wanted to give a guy a blowjob as a way of apology. I wanted her to find out who the killer is before anyone else, escape from her mother's destructive claws and her sister's manipulation and settle with Richard. Camille is smart and reckless. She wants to recover but doesn't know where to start. Being monumentally fucked up, she's reminded every day by carves on her skin of the pain and trauma she's experienced. Frankly, she's worth cheering for. Having lost her sister and never knowing motherly or even fatherly love, Camille was a teenage girl who'd let anyone take advantage of her. Not much has changed over the years. ""It is sort of a wild story, you know? A crazy lady snatches Natalie in broad daylight,"" he said. ""Besides, why would a woman do something like that?"" ""Why would a man do something like that?"" I asked.  I love authors who tend to shove taboos and stereotypes in the face. “And sometimes drunk women aren't raped; they just make stupid choices--and to say we deserve special treatment when we're drunk because we're women, to say we need to be looked after, I find offensive.”  Despite of how much she hides it, Camille is very hot-tempered.  ""He needed no foreplay for the interview, and I was grateful. It's like sweet-talking your date when you both know you're about to get laid.”  The rare perks of being a journalist.  “I’m not one of those reporters who relishes picking through people’s privacy. It’s probably the reason I’m a second-rate journalist.”  If you haven't realised it by now, I'm completely in love with Camille. Amma plays the good girl acting younger than 13 for her mother but for others, she's promiscuous and vicious. She controls her friends with fear, sex and drugs. Constantly seeking her mother's approval, she goes from hysteria to ecstasy, from depression to kindness, over and over again. She's a first-class manipulator.  “Sometimes if you let people do things to you, you’re really doing it to them,” Amma said, pulling another Blow Pop from her pocket. Cherry. “Know what I mean? If someone wants to do fucked-up things to you, and you let them, you’re making them more fucked up. Then you have the control. As long as you don’t go crazy.”  Don't let her fool you, she IS crazy, plain and simple. It's really hard to describe Adora. She's paranoid, cold, manipulative, basically an attention whore. I must've used word ""manipulative"" at least 10 times by now, ugh. Everything she did to her children is deeply disturbing and don't even let me get started on how she probably brainwashed her husband Alan. I loved all interactions between Camille and Amma. Despite of all her efforts, Camille empathizes and cares for Amma. On the other hand, Amma looks up to Camille in some weird way. Camille tried to save her, but not only Amma was beyond saving, also it's impossible to mend something broken, when you're almost unfixable too.“When I'd been sad, I hurt myself. Amma hurt other people. When I'd wanted attention, I'd submitted myself to boys: Do what you want; just like me. Amma's sexual offerings seemed a form of aggression. Long skinny legs and slim wrists and high, babied voice all aimed like a gun. Do what I want; I might like you.”  They're two sides of the same coin, only Amma is the cruel one and Camille is the delicate one. And finally, there is the sick dynamic between Camille and Adora. Though, it's almost non-existent. Except when Camille is ill and helpless. This book is a case where it's completely justified to say parents ruined their children and therefore it's their fault for ongoing tragedy. Check out my blog! "

I wanted to know more about this dark place and its secrets, and even though I cringed whenever I heard about the citizens' behaviour, I loved it! Nevertheless, this book also appalled me in a negative way. As mentioned earlier, this city has its secrets and they're all horrifying. People accept each other's behaviour when they shouldn't, and I had a hard time accepting that when reading. The ending surprised me, and that's something I value a lot in a crime story. Normally, I'm not much into crime, but this is a story worth reading because it's about so much more than just the murder.

While on this rare visit home, she is accommodated by her estranged mother Adora, who has always been very cold and hostile towards her. Suprisingly, Adora behaves affectionately towards Camille's precocious thirteen-year-old half sister Amma; another member of the family with good looks and brains, and who can quickly switch from her innocent, child-like persona to a drugs, sex and alcohol crazed teenager whenever her mother isn't present. Despite the murders being a hot topic of local gossip, Camille is finding it hard to obtain any real lead from conversations with old classmates and friends. It is only a matter of time before Camille realizes that suspects and clues are a lot closer than she thought.Towards the end of the novel, you believe that you have completely solved the mystery before the protagonist. However, upon reaching the twist in the story, you realize that you only put half of the puzzle together correctly. The ending of the book is magnificently disturbing. When you put the book down it feels like you have awoken mid-sleep from a terrifying nightmare."

61,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44487975-dannii-elle,Rating 4 out of 5,"Actual rating 4.5/5 stars.My love for Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl had me hesitating for a long time over whether I should pick up some of her earlier work. I was unsure whether they could compare with their predecessor, with half a decade having passed between her debut and, arguable, her most well-known publication.I quickly found I need not fear, as I was transported into a whirlwind plot of just as many secrets and lies stemming from the mouths of just as many unlikable and messed-up characters. Flynn fortes in making me love to hate and hate to love her creations: even as I am vying for their destruction a murkier place inside of me is eager to read of their next transgression, taking some sort of sick glee in seeing their dark deeds play out across the pages.This book is formulated around a myriad of unhealthy relationships, and I feel I can relate in how sucked-down-the-rabbit-hole crazy this made me! There is little redeeming light glanced upon any of the characters, the plot only gets more muddled with trickery and lies as it continues, and even the ending delivered another twist to the already tangled narrative. All of those aspects kept me glued to the pages, relegating all other responsibilities for another time, and entirely absorbed in this fucked up story line to end all other others."
62,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie,Rating 4 out of 5,"Sharp Objects by Gillian Flynn is a 2006 publication.I have had this book in my TBR list for years, have checked it out of the library twice, only to have to send it back unread due to my review schedule. So, finally, I just pushed everything aside and checked it back out of the library and refused to pick up another book until this one was finished. Well, after such a long wait, the build up and hype left me with an anti-climatic feeling. However, the book was still quite absorbing and all the reviews you've read warning of very dark subject matter, are true and then some. Since twenty thousand plus people have left a review for this book on Goodreads, so I don't think you need another detailed opinion from me. But, I will say it's not for the faint of heart and one should be prepared for some very graphic depictions, super evil and demented characters, and a tightly woven story that will keep you guessing all the way to the end. So, if you enjoy truly twisted psychological thrillers and haven't read this one yet, I hope you will find a way to work it into your reading schedule. But, beware, once you finish this one you will definitely want to read something with a lighter tone in order to cleanse away the residue the story will leave in your brain. Over all 4 stars"

64,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5953660-malia,Rating 1 out of 5,"I am clearly in the minority here, but I hated this book! I don't like writing anything to bad about a book, but I cannot in good faith say anything else. I wasn't impressed with 'Gone Girl', but having read this, it is by far the superior of the two. 'Sharp Objects' is revolting in every way. I disliked all the characters, the setting was depressing and disturbing (in know, I know, that's the point, but humor me here while I vent), and the the plot... oh where do I begin?!The story, centers around a young reporter living in Chicago, who is sent on an assignment to her little Missouri hometown when two young girls are found murdered in the same horrific way within the space of a year. Camille, the reporter in question is terrible traumatized by the death of her sister many years ago, and has a weird relationship wit her mother and stepfather.Okay, so the premise sounds intriguing and creepy, that's fine, I'm not expecting a Disney fairy-tale, but it is too much. EVERYTHING is just utterly miserable. The people in the town are portrayed as totally backward and Camille comes across as both whiny and often condescending. I felt bad for her situation, and how she felt, but I just didn't like her at all. Flynn tries so hard to make her character so flawed and vulnerable, but she just seems extremely depressed and a danger to herself. I wanted someone kind to come and pull her out of that awful situation and get her some help and care. If there had just been one character I felt any connection to, but there wasn't. The plot too, didn't feel tense or gripping, it just slogged on annoyingly with endless vile details. I really should have stopped reading, but I kept hoping it would somehow get better...I don't want to give away anything, but the end felt rushed and kind of predictable, which was disappointing after this endless buildup I had to battle through to reach it. Sorry for the ranting, but the one thing this book did evoke in me was a great sense of irritation that it has been hailed as such an amazing read, when what it was, to me at least, was disgusting and deeply disappointing.Find more reviews and bookish fun at http://www.princessandpen.com"

Se trata de una ópera prima muy sobresaliente. Con una carga emocional muy potente. Por lo que narra y cómo lo narra. Tenemos por un lado a Camille Preaker, la protagonista principal, que viaja a su pueblo natal, Wind Gap en Missouri, para cubrir una serie de asesinatos atroces a dos menores. Y en su viaje para esclarecer los hechos junto con Richard, un policía que mandan desde la ciudad de Arkansas al estar más versado en este tipo de crímenes, se reencuentra con Amma, su hermanastra adolescente. Y su autoritaria madre, Adora. A las que hacía la friolera de ocho años que no veía. Desde ahí empezamos a ver los entresijos de sus relaciones, su toxicidad, que casi se puede respirar a través de sus páginas. Con un lenguaje directo y a veces hasta sucio nos lleva de la mano de Camille hasta sus más recónditos miedos.La voz en primera persona a mi personalmente me encanta, hace que me meta en la historia con más facilidad y le otorga más profundidad a lo narrado.Aquí todo el peso de la trama recae en las féminas, los hombres son solo meros figurantes.Es de esos libros que dosificaba su lectura porque no quería que se terminara. Hay que ir saboreándolo poco a poco, y te va calando de una manera bestial. Pero a medida que venía el inevitable final, lo hacía con el estómago encogido. Qué dolor 💔.Qué dureza.Y qué forma de narrarlo.Me ha espantado y maravillado a partes iguales. De los pocos libros que me han hecho soltar alguna lágrima de pura impotencia. Es asombrosa la capacidad de diseccionar la psique humana que tiene.Chapó Gillian por lograr algo así. Conjunción de mentes enfermas, situaciones siniestras, malsanas y retorcidas. ¿Qué más se puede pedir? 😍Ahora lo que toca es ver la adaptación a mini serie que sacó HBO hace unos años, protagonizada por Amy Adams, y ver si está a la altura de la novela. ¿Te atreves a adentrarte en los entresijos de los habitantes de Wind Gap? No será fácil salir de ese pueblo. Yo aún estoy intentando recuperarme.💔🔪 ""La verdad descarnada, sobre mi piel, en una caligrafía extravagante."" 💔🔪 ""Así es Wind Gap. Todos conocemos los secretos de todos. Y todos los utilizamos.""💔🔪 ""Creo que algunas mujeres no están hechas para ser madres, simplemente.

I’ve had Sharp Objects sitting on my shelf years now. When I heard that one of my favorite actresses, Amy Adams, was going to be starring in the HBO adaptation, I knew I needed to get to it soon so I wouldn’t have to feel the guilt of watching before reading. And what better way to work it in than a TBT post?At only 252 pages, Sharp Objects made for a quick and compelling read. I’d read the reviews saying how dark and disturbing it was but still wasn’t fully prepared. I know many of you have already read this book and I don’t want to ruin it for those of you who haven’t so I won’t discuss the details of the plot. Suffice to say that it’s one of the most bizarre, twisted, and depraved books I’ve read in a long time. At the same time, it is one of the most creative, imaginative, and consuming as well!If you love books with gut-wrenching crime scenes and deeply dysfunction families, Sharp Objects is a must-read. At the end of this book there were all sorts of nature vs. nurture questions swirling around in my head.Though I found Sharp Objects to be quite different from Gone Girl, and I’m not sure I loved it quite as much, I think it was a great read. I’m definitely glad I read this book before the TV adaptation.4.25/5 stars**I think it’s worth mentioning that there are some graphic descriptions of the protagonist’s struggle with self-harm/cutting.**"

And some women aren’t made to be daughters.Sharp Objects is an absorbing story. To say Camille, the narrator and protagonist, is damaged is an understatement. She’s a cutter, who does not even seem to realized how sexualized and troubled her adolescence was. Her relationships with every other character gives the story its flow, and obscures the truth until the final pages.Is Sharp Objects as good as  Gone Girl? No, but here’s a confession. I read the second half of Sharp Objects while flying and I felt physically ill for much of the flight. I tried to blame taking my Dramamine late, but I didn’t. Sharp Objects was just that absorbing and upsetting, which I think is pretty high praise. Recommended."

70,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1416912-trudi,Rating 5 out of 5,"Camille Preaker is haunted by childhood memories of a cold, hysterical mother and the devastating loss of her sister, Marian, who died when Camille was only 13. Literally carrying her war wounds upon her flesh, Camille is a recovering ""cutter"" who has carved a myriad of words into her skin as a visible record of the pain and trauma she's experienced. Having escaped from the clutches of a cloying family environment, Camille is being sent back into the cauldron, this time as a reporter for a second-rate newspaper to cover the gruesome murders of two local pre-teens. The more involved she becomes in the mystery, the more she uncovers about her town, her family, and herself. The discoveries are anything but pleasant.Part thriller, part mystery, part Southern Gothic, Gillian Flynn's debut novel is simply outstanding. Camille Preaker is a heroine worth cheering for, as Flynn expertly delves into the female psyche and the delicate, often damaging ties between mothers and daughters. In the tradition of Flannery O'Connor, the writing here is so effective and evocative, this one will stay with you long after the reading is done."

Unfortunately, I still think that Dark Places was so messed up in a fantastic way that all other pales compared. Even in Gone Girl, I hated ALL of the characters, even though I could appreciate the wit. Now we are on Sharp Objects... This family takes the cake for dysfunctional! I was still entertained, even though pretty much everyone in the book had a severe issue with emotionally connecting to anything or anyone in their lives, which was understandable, but also weird to read about, with pretty much all of the characters being that way except for the overly emotional brother we meet. In that way. I was connected to ZERO characters while reading the book, which makes me not get into it, but I would probably be a messed up person if I COULD secure to any of them... So there is that. This was a LIKE, not LOVE book, but still worth a read at some point... Now I wonder what they did in the Netflix series of it..... (still need to watch this, I am a slacker)"
73,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,Rating 3 out of 5,"I don't read many mysteries but I doubt the reader is supposed to be able to figure out ""whodunnit"" early on. It's more fun to keep guessing, to think you know only to have everything tossed upside down and you have to guess again. Repeat a few times before the end.With this book, I had part of it figured out immediately and the other had a strong hunch about, which ended up being correct. I think that probably makes it a mediocre mystery.It wasn't all that believable story either. I was especially put off by the MC being a cutter when the author doesn't seem to ""get"" cutting. For instance, this: ""My upper lip curled involuntarily in repulsion at the sight of my skin"".. Um, nope. She would have felt proud of those scars. Embarrassed for others to see them but looking at them in private? Oh she'd have been proud, not disgusted. The author seems to have made her a cutter just to add more reasons for the book being titled ""Sharp Objects"". However, if one doesn't understand something, they need to leave it alone, not add it to their book. In case you can't tell, I'm peeved with this.2.5 stars, but I always round up.

Jednostavno rečeno, knjiga mi je bila očajna.A onda se na kioscima pojavilo hrvatsko izdanje ove knjige po ekstra ceni i đavo mi nije dao mira i morao sam da je kupim i pročitam. I moram priznati da mi je drago što sam to uradio!Ako je nekome Gone Girl bio mučan i mračan roman, ovaj bolje da ostavi po strani odmah. Sharp Objects nije lako štivo - u ovom romanu nema ničeg lepog ili romantičnog - ljubav ne postoji, a isto tako ne postoji ni prijateljstvo već samo njihovi prividi ispod kojih se kriju mržnja, koristoljublje ili još neke nijanse ljudske patologije i zlobe.Mali gradić u Americi je poprište gnusnih zločina, a u njemu na prvi pogled žive savršeni stanovnici koji sa više ili manje veštine kriju svoju patološku sje***ost (izvinjavam se zbog izraza ali za ovu knjigu ovaj termin savršeno odgovara). I nema tu nikog nevinog ili naivnog - sve su to sociopate ili psihopate. Svi su oni skrenuli sa pravog puta na ovaj ili onaj način... Camille, ona koja je imala hrabrosti da napusti ovaj godforsaken gradić, se vraća i njeni demoni ne samo da se vraćaju nego se multiplikuju i dobijaju mnogo veće obrise. Njeno telo, odnosno koža, je živi hram njenog uma koji je odbio da se savija po majčinim i gradskim normama, i reči koje je ona strastveno urezivala u sebe su reči koje reflektuju njenu patologiju i one bride i peku i opominju svaka kada dođe pravi čas... I ona takva, oskrnavljena vlastitom rukom (da ne bi podlegla bolu, zlu, većem ludilu) vraća se na mesto zločina koje je učinjeno prema njoj, ovoga puta kao novinarka da bi rečima rasvetlila druga dva zločina. Na tom putu otkrića koje za nju ima i ulogu katarze konačno će doći do skoro pa ontološkog pitanja - da li je ona drugačija od onoga od čega je bežala ili je ona, u stvari, bežala sama od sebe.Ovaj spisateljski prvenac Gillian Flynn, je dakle mnogo jači i eksplicitniji od Gone Girl. Sam setting i lepeza likova, koji su mnogo bolje definisiani svojim patološkim nijansama, doprinose toj turobnoj i mračnoj atmosferi koja na momente postaje lepljiva od krvi ili koja svrbi kao novi ožiljak na koži. Jedina zamerka je whodunit deo koji se poprilično lako može razrešiti (zbog toga je i ona zvezdica manje od maksimuma). Sve u svemu, ovo je žestoko dobar triler, ali vam treba dobar stomak da biste ga svarili!!!"
78,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111513919-gabriel,Rating 4 out of 5," Heridas abiertas es puro dolor, suspenso y la psiquis trastornada de sus personajes.  Es una historia que toma como eje las relaciones familiares en un entorno tétrico y abusivo. Es más, la historia tiene como especialidad estar ubicada dentro del thriller puramente psicológico.Para empezar, Gillian Flynn centra su historia en contar y mostrar varias facetas oscuras y tenebrosas de sus personajes. Hay un retrato enfermizo, insano, tóxico y bastante siniestro en cada uno de ellos. Es más, la atmósfera sombría y gótica que crea sin ser una prosa tan adornada o maravillosa te mantiene siempre en vilo y con las ganas de seguir leyendo a medida que se van juntando las pocas piezas del tablero. Sin embargo, es por eso mismo que creo que en este caso la trama de la historia se basa más que todo en darte mal rollo con las situaciones que se presentan y lo tan dañado que tienen la mentalidad los personajes (sus mismo traumas, miserias y dependencias emocionales); que en tratar de resolver o encontrar un culpable a los asesinatos cometidos.Quizás, es por eso mismo que hay gente decepcionada con este libro. Por eso, si estás buscando una trama centrada en resolver el misterio de los crímenes, te vas a llevar un estrellón porque esto es lo secundario. Es más que solo eso, porque la verdad en cierto modo a mí me resultó totalmente predecible quién o quiénes estaban implicados, pero eso no quiere decir que no me pareció adictivo o interesante hasta el increíble desenlace. Aunque por el contrario, si lo que quieres es un thriller psicológico con drama como condimento este es tu lugar. Para mí es simplemente adictiva y disfruto viendo representados personajes así de dañados en la literatura."

Aaaand on that note, welcome all to Episode 2 of Quickie Review with Valliya. Before we start, I must issue a few trigger warnings for this book: drugs, alcohol abuse, harming oneself, sexualising children.Gillian Flynn's debut novel is a peculiarly addicting one. With an atmospheric, grotesque prose, Flynn's novel inserts you right into the plot and reveals things systematically, about Camille (the main character), the mystery, the town. This strategy works well in creating a tone for the plot involving a reporter coming back to her home town after being released from a psych ward to find herself in the middle of a murder investigation surrounding two young girls who had their teeth removed post-mortem. Flynn's writing is most reminiscent of Stephen King's, where he describes the world in a very raw way, almost as if he were writing about a caricature of life. However, where King spends a lot of time in the exposition (pre-conflict I might even say) to build up his characters, Flynn throws you right into the middle of the plot and reveals things about character and mystery slowly. Thanks to this creative choice, Flynn gives the novel a unique feel of a good blend between a character and plot driven story. My biggest qualms were that at places foreshadowing didn't exactly hit rightly at places, and that some threads weren't exactly explained/resolved when I felt they should have been All in all, I do recommend this book to perhaps less experienced, but mature, people who might want to give this a try.Snappy Spoilers:- I am confused as to why Adora (the mom) bit the baby that one time...- Richard forgetting about Camille kind of felt stupid for me, as there was so much set up, with so little pay-off; on the other hand, that is what life is like sometimes, so I guess, make of this what you will- Marian's case wasn't foreshadowed enough. Instead of talking about the sleeping with Camille, time should have been spent describing her illness and the peculiar circumstances surrounding it- John and Meredith situation: didn't get a resolution- I guess I wanted to see a bit more of the fallout than just three pages of epilogue- Loved the reveal with Amma (also, I love the ironic name ""Amity"")Thank you all for joining in for Episode 2 of Quickie Review with Valliya!Previous episode: Silent Spring - Rachel Carson ★★Next episode: The Dead Zone - Stephen King ★.25"

I need to write it at the most one day after reading the book.As for this book... it was great! I can't wait to start reading Dark Places. In fact, if it wasn't because I have no time to read, I would have probably started and finished it already. The nastiness of Sharp Objects is enough to convice me of trying more of Flynn's works.Don't forget to read the full review!________________________________________October 16th, 2015:Buddy read with Evelyn. (She actually abandoned me halfway through and finished the book for herself, but shhh)I can now see what people meant when they said Gillian Flynn has a twisted mind. All the characters in here are fucked up, complex, and while not always likable, they were relatable at times. I even found myself in some. The mystery was also great, and thrilling, as it should always be in a mystery/thriller novel. I can't wait to read more of Flynn's. I love nasty.Full review to come.

84,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365405-james,Rating 3 out of 5,"Sharp Objects is a thriller written by Gillian Flynn. I've previously read her other two suspense books, both made into films, and wanted to round out her three most popular novels; there is one more less popular novel of hers that I will eventually read too. While there were many great aspects to this one, it is my least favorite and had too many disjointed, cavernous holes that I couldn't ignore. For those reasons, I couldn't justify giving the book more than three stars, which in my opinion, is still good, and I would recommend reading it - just go in knowing there will be concerns. Minimal spoilers below (not murderer's identity) so go in reading my review carefully.Camille is a troubled reporter who's been recovering from something. She's assigned to a serial murder case in her Missouri hometown by a supportive boss, who is also her friend. Upon arrival, it's clear she and her mother have a lot of complex history to unpack. We learn that Camille is a cutter who's destroyed her body because of these issues with her own mother. A sister died from an illness nearly two decades ago, and she also has a 13-year old half-sister, Amma, through her mother's marriage. Two 13-year old girls were found murdered in a nearby forest. Both girls' teeth were removed, but they weren't molested, which confuses the detectives in terms of motives. The local cop seems useless... the bigshot from Kansas City doesn't have much but is willing to work with Camille on the story.Let's begin with the positives. The writing is strong. The imagery is clear. I felt transported to a depressed, frightened town with a diverse cast of characters. Camille has many levels to her personality, and she's obviously worked hard to escape from an awful upbringing. Adora (mother) is a horrendous woman on one page and a loving, supporting mother in the next few. Rich with complexity. Flynn excelled at communicating all of those components. Digging further into these details will be tough without giving away any spoilers... and explaining the parts of the story where I found missing things will be even harder, but I will try.On the negative side, I hardly knew anything about their town. Why were all the young girls complete nasty trolls who lashed out at their friends? How could Adora, Camille and Amma's mother, let Amma behave that way? I know she was a bit off her rocker, but she also was a society matron, and no one told her that Amma was doing bad things... sex at 13 and still clueless? What about her father and why he ignored it? Then I struggled with Camille's personality and issues. I completely understand she had a tough mother and her coping mechanism was to cut herself. I get how that is a medical/psychological disorder/illness but sometimes it was as if she cut herself a few times and had two or three scars while others it was described that she had hundreds of words carved on her skin to the point she only had one small spot on her back without any words. The explanations didn't add up, and it felt like the author herself didn't know so she just wanted to make it a big piece of Camille's story. I don't at all think it was poorly handled... in fact, I think it's good to spotlight this stuff so people with tendencies to harm themselves see characters like themselves in books and know they can recover, but that was mostly all ignored here. The plot went nowhere.On top of all that... not a single person in the town had any clue about the murderer's identity. And then when we get the twist at the end, that the person arrested wasn't actually guilty, and the true culprit almost got away with it... I was dumbfounded again. Yes, we need to be creative as authors and sometimes push our readers out of a comfort zone with what they believe, but... we went from page 350 where the detective is arresting the killer to the explanation and building out Camille's future to realizing someone else was the killer in 10 pages, without any details of what happened in the 3 month period between those two chapters. It felt extremely forced... and while I LOVE the plot and different angles, 50 pages of repetition could've been cut from earlier chapters and substituted with 50 pages of detail and explanation near the end. Then I would've totally raved about the story. I blame the editing team on this one; they should've stepped back and said, ""Maybe things aren't connecting and we moved too fast here.""I could say a lot more, but I don't want to spoil too much. I've already told you the first person picked as the killer isn't the truth, but I will watch the TV series and I will read the author's next book. They're generally well written and truly bring you into the depth of the story, so that's a reason to enjoy them too."

But other times we don't really know who we are. We never did. Sick kids of sicker parents, neurosis and cruelty are diseases that corrupt and erode everything that stands in their way. Secrets upon secrets, mouths closed and eyes that turn blind. Beauty and money have a way to smooth the rough edges, but razor sharp objects tear the layers and let all the puss ooze free from wounds that will never heal.
“How do you keep safe when your whole day is as wide and empty as the sky?”
 Darkness and nightmares have nothing on the unforgiving light of day and dreams that never come true. Demons are trembling in fear when compared to people abusing others and sick individuals capable of unimaginable pain.Camille Preaker, a young journalist is broken. A kid from a dysfunctional family she is trying to make her life work in Chicago. When a murder case will take her back in her hometown, to live again in her mother's house where she managed to escape years ago, it will drive her to the edge. Her old scars are itching and new ones are lurking in the shadows.
“Camille?"" Her voice quiet and girlish and unsure. ""You know how people sometimes say they have to hurt because if they don't, they're so numb they won't feel anything?""""Mmm.""""What if it's the opposite?"" Amma whispered. ""What if you hurt because it feels so good? Like you have a tingling, like someone left a switch on in your body. And nothing can turn that switch off except hurting? What does that mean?""
Sweet mother of God.... I can't comprehend what I just read. I am heartbroken, scared and disgusted. An intense read, unforgettable and unforgiving. No sugar-coating, no mercy. Sickness and madness go hand to hand and you are left feeling dirty like someone touched you and made you uncomfortable. A book about mothers and daughters, the most cherished relationship, turned sour and twisted beyond belief. 
“I just think some women aren't made to be mothers. And some women aren't made to be daughters.”
A story that the ending will leave you with eyes wide open and a little bit despaired.Amazing and gripping you won't be able to take a deep breath. Read it!Gillian Flynn is a hell of a storyteller..."
86,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42294189-roger-brunyate,Rating 2 out of 5,"NauseaI have just finished Gillian Flynn’s debut novel, and feel rather sick. Not the kind of sick that comes from a harrowing mystery finally solved, leaving you shaken but safely out the other side. No, the result of overlong immersion in a vaguely incestuous, sludgy drama that just made me feel dirtier and dirtier and didn’t even afford some decent catharsis at the end.Oh, it begins well enough. I was looking for a quick read as a break from the two long novels I was already mired in. The 3-for-2 offer at B&N hooked me, and I was eagerly on my way. Flynn writes good prose, with an eye for the apt but unusual simile, so this started out as a 4-to-5-star read. Camille Preaker, a reporter on a minor Chicagoland paper, is sent back to her home town of Wind Gap, Missouri, to investigate what seems to be the serial murder of two young girls. There is an established pattern for such books: after a bit of pottering around, there will be another murder or two, which will shake up the roster of suspects and put the heroine herself into danger.Only it doesn’t happen that way at all. The only other murder is more or less an afterthought. Speaking for myself, I hit on two possible suspects well before the halfway point, and the book did nothing to suggest any remotely possible alternatives. Instead, we enter into a nauseating nightmare in which just about everyone we meet—primarily women—are painted in unsympathetic terms. There are Camille’s old school friends, grown into catty socialites. There are their tween-age daughters, an almost feral group of junior blondes. There is Camille’s half-sister Amma, thirteen, their leader in the town and a spoiled child at home. And there is Camille’s wealthy mother, Adora, a woman as cold as the solid ivory floor in her bedroom.And then there is Camille herself, who turns out to have major problems of her own. One of these is the abnormality implied by the title and cover; though it is largely in the past, she still bears the scars. But the one that most got to me is her drinking. I cannot long retain sympathy for a heroine, however bright, who goes through her day downing drink after drink, and repeated descriptions of the resultant puking do not endear me either. It became harder and harder to distinguish Camille from the toxic environment. Was she in danger, and from whom? By the middle of the book, I found I no longer cared.Gillian Flynn does have a twist at the end, but it is a small one, a slight reshuffling of the deck. It does little to clear the air or, as Lady Macbeth said, to wash this filth from off my hands.[PS. It seems almost irrelevant to mention it, but the framing device of the novel is quite implausible. It is hard to believe in Camille Preaker as a functioning reporter, difficult to imagine her editor sending her on a project of so little concern to his readers, and impossible to believe him keeping her there so long when she turns up so little. And then at the end, when she does uncover something of some value, it is simply presented to her on a plate—a handwritten note somehow preserved in a file she would never have got permission to look at anyway.]"
87,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3104032-regina,Rating 5 out of 5,"I love a good psychological thriller with disturbingly flawed characters and this book did not disappoint. The main character is a woman struggling to make a life for herself, fleeing her childhood and really, fleeing her mother when she is sent back to her home town as an investigative reporter. She is tasked to report on the gruesome murders of two pre-teen girls, but in the process she gets put right back in the middle of her messed up family dynamics, her small town’s social structure, and a potential romance. Ms. Flynn nails perfectly small Midwest town life. A quote in her description of small town life, “Like all rural towns, Wind Gap has an obsession with machinery. Most homes own a car and a half for every occupant, plus boats, Jet Skis, scooters, tractors, and among the elite of Wind Gap, golf cars, which younger kids without licenses use to whip around town.”Ms. Flynn makes some disturbing observations about parenting and family life – and ties them in to premature death:As to the death of a young girl, “it’s the only way to truly keep your child. Kids grow up, they forge more potent allegiances. They find a spouse or a lover. They will not be buried with you. The Keenes, however will remain the purest form of family. Underground.”The situations described in this book are exceptional, but she breaks the image of small rural life as being ideal. Terrifying violence and dysfunction lurks beneath the surface and I have to say, she nailed it in terms of describing my small rural home town. As Flynn writes, the idealic quality of small towns is false. A question is – should people go home once they have fled extreme unhappiness? Can they go home and survive it emotionally? Going home almost undoes Camille and as the story is told the readers see from a disturbing first person angle, Camille’s personal psychological problems and the extent of her damage. It was terrifying to read about, but I could not put the book down.A truly horrifying image of the protagonist’s mother:  “I remember my mother, alone in the living room, staring at the child almost lasciviously. She pressed her lips hard against the baby’s apple slice of a cheek. Then she opened her mouth just slightly, took a tiny bit of flesh between her teeth, and gave it a little bite.” A question I had was, what was Ms. Flynn’s message in this? Small rural towns are messed up? Family dynamics can really screw people up? Old school social hierarchies breed disturbing people? I did find it interesting that the men in this story, save one, are thoroughly disappointing and that the evil, cruel and shallow women are upholding traditional images of beauty and also, were physically ultra feminine in terms of how our society defines such things. The violence that happens to women and girls happens on the brink of girls becoming women, and the things done to them  shaving the girls legs, fixing their hair, painting their nails  are superficial ways femininity has been defined in our modern culture. And finally, the evil doers  are the ultra beautiful, the ultra coiffed, and the ultra physical female ideals . What comment is Flynn making on images of women, female sexuality and femininity in modern US culture? I am asking because I have not yet decided what the answer is.I recommend this book for people who enjoy dark psychological thrillers, where the mystery and murder are just set ups for authors to portray dark disturbing characters and fully fleshed but damaging relationships. I would say fans of Tana French, Donna Tartt, and Laura Kasischke would enjoy this book, but beware, it is not for the faint hearted – the decryptions of physical violence can be upsetting."

Sin embargo, la trama se cae un poco en la intriga relacionada con los crímenes que se investigan (que al final se resuelven muy precipitadamente, casi como en un epílogo) y con algunos hilos argumentales que no tienen ninguna dirección y ningún cierre tampoco.Aunque este libro no alcanza la calidad y madurez de Perdida, es una buena lectura, sobre todo si te gusta disfrutar de la voz que narra, más que de la narración en sí."

90,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28854579-glenn-sumi,Rating 3 out of 5,"Flynn’s debut thriller draws blood – but could use a sharper edge (or: You Could Have Gone Further, Girl)I’ve read Gillian Flynn’s books in reverse order. I began with her blockbuster novel 
Gone Girl.
 Then I read her second book, 
Dark Places.
 I gave both of them 4 stars. And now I’ve finally got around to her debut thriller, Sharp Objects. The thing is: Flynn has become a better writer over time. So is it fair to judge her earlier work by the standards she sets later? Perhaps not.But one thing’s clear. Even in her first book, she shows remarkable promise, a taste for gore and a weakness for fucked up, disturbed characters. These aren’t people you’d want hang out with, necessarily, but as subjects in a book they’re pretty darn intriguing.Camille Preaker is a hard-drinking journalist at a second-rate Chicago daily, assigned to look into the murder of one girl and the disappearance of another in Wind Gap, her Missouri hometown. Turns out these crimes open up some old wounds – both metaphorical and literal – in her own life. While covering the story, she grudgingly stays in the spacious home of her mother, Adora, heir to a food company fortune, Adora’s non-communicative second husband (and Camille’s stepfather), Alan, and Amma, their precocious, spoiled child.From the start it’s clear there’s something wrong with the family – besides the memory of Camille’s own dead sibling. In fact, there’s something wrong with the town itself. Or is Camille just too close to the story?Talking with a handsome Kansas City cop on the case (who’s also attracted to her) gives her some distance and objectivity. But soon she’s being pulled into the town’s destructive orbit, drinking, taking drugs and considering cutting her already marked-up body to dull the emotional pain. All the elements for a first-rate thriller are here, but something’s missing. The mystery isn’t that difficult to solve, for one. And in later books Flynn would learn more effective ways of plotting – planting clues, suggesting themes, using past and present to create tension. Even though I just finished this book, I have a clearer sense of Gone Girl’s Nick and Amy and Dark Places’ Libby, than I do of Camille. The cutting scenes aren’t that powerful, either, especially after reading those harrowing passages in A Little Life. But even at the start of her career, Flynn shows talent. Her dialogue is excellent – the characters all have distinct speech patterns. And her insights into how the media influence and shape people’s ideas of themselves – a major theme in Gone Girl – is present here as well.One more thought: For all her self-destructive behaviour, Camille’s journalistic questions feel authentic. No surprise there. Flynn worked for many years at Entertainment Weekly. And Camille grew up deflecting things from herself as a survival mechanism. Details like these add a satisfying sharpness to Sharp Objects. I just wanted a little bit more."

96,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6753400-gabrielle,Rating 5 out of 5,"Updated review, with comments about the HBO series at the end.--Sweet, sweet twisted darkness. This book is stock-full of sick stuff, and I enjoyed it the way I would have enjoyed a burger and fries from my local greasy-spoon: with gluttony. And just like a junk food binge, it made me feel dirty: I wanted to hop in the shower with a scrub brush and wash myself pink and raw once I was done with this short, but very impactful book.I really like dark books, with sick and disturbing stories, interesting and well-fleshed out characters. I like gritty settings, imperfect people, weird psychological traumas. But I hate popular stuff, and since everyone raves about Gillian Flynn like she’s the best thing since sliced bread, I avoided her books for a long time. That’s me: too cool for school and afraid to find out a popular writer is just another Dan Brown... Of course, I eventually gave in and out of morbid curiosity, decided to find out what the fuss was all about.Here is a short list of disturbing stuff you can expect to encounter if you decide to pick up this book:•	Really dysfunctional mother-daughter relationship•	Self-mutilation•	Psychopathic adolescents•	Animal slaughter, both commercial and recreational•	Alcoholism•	Barely legal sexual intercourse•	Small-town America cabin fever (by that I mean small town where everyone knows about everyone else’s dirty laundry)And I haven’t even brought up the serial killer who gets a kick from removing 13-year olds’ teeth!I liked Ms. Flynn’s refusal to make victims out of women, to show that they can be just as vicious, violent and evil as men. She has discussed in it interviews and I have to agree with the points she makes. I suppose writers are sometimes afraid to create truly horrid female characters because they don’t want to be accused of misogyny. It’s a legitimate fear (especially with Internet culture, where someone will inevitably twist something you said to make it sound like you are the anti-Christ, even if what you said was “I love bunny rabbits”) but I think it’s complete denial to pretend all women are angels incapable of hurting a fly. As someone who spent over a decade being bullied relentlessly, I can tell you that the people who were cruelest and most damaging to me were always women… No one ever tried to strangle me and remove my teeth, but I don’t have a hard time imagining that a woman is just as capable of such acts as a man is.Another big thumbs up goes to Flynn for creating interesting (though not very likable) female characters, none of which are stereotypical! They are insecure, but also fierce, intelligent (sometimes, a bit too intelligent for their own good… or the good of others), broken but (in Camille’s case, at least) determined to not let it get the best of them. I enjoyed their unpredictability, they felt real. I wouldn’t want to hang out with Camille, but I felt for her and empathized with the incredibly tough place she found herself in. I wanted to hug her and help her get better.And by the way, the violence in this book is not simply the gruesome murders: a lot of the harm these people suffer is psychological in nature. Secrets, neurosis, withholding of affections, jealousies… That eventually leads to physical violence and self-harm, but it starts inside the heads and hearts of the characters before it is externalized. Mother-daughter relationships are complicated, very delicate things and when they are healthy, they are very nurturing and wonderful; but when they go bad, few things can be as destructive, and I think Flynn did a wonderful job of showing this very peculiar dynamic at work. It is not an easy subject to tackle, and I found the description of the very intricate and mixed feelings going on between Camille and Adora to ring true. The scene at the clothing store when Adora forces Camille to try dresses on and insists she comes out of the changing room, when she knows damn well her daughter is covered in self-inflicted scars… That scene gave me the shivers and made me feel sick. And then the last 20 or 30 pages… yikes…Not for the faint of heart, but delightfully morbid and deranged.***I was very curious as to how this book would translate to television, and as soon as I knew Jean-Marc Vallée was at the helm, I knew I’d check it out: he is an awesome director, and his movie “C.R.A.Z.Y.” is one of my all-time favorites films. It’s been said by many critics: the photography and editing was amazing! It perfectly captures the way memories creep up on us and how our mind makes them overlap with what’s going on. My gripe with the show (and I think this is a very unpopular opinion) is Amy Adams. I understand why she was cast: the actress who plays young Camille might as well be her twin, and she does look like she could be related to Patricia Clarkson and Eliza Scanlen – but I’ve never liked her acting. I find her stiff and awkward. In pretty much everything. She doesn’t emote; I don’t get it. I had imagined Camille very, very differently: darker, more vulnerable, richer in her faux-tough journalist attitude, sexy in a disturbing way. So sadly, this made it a little hard to enjoy the show. I stuck it out because of how gorgeously filmed it was, and because I love grim stories with complicated female characters. And then the end just made me facepalm.My advice would be to stick to the book."

Flynn delivers a well-written, sinister narrative showcasing just how jaded people can be. It is dark but the darkness isn’t completely revealed until the second half of the book. It was slow paced and peppered with unnecessary information in the beginning. Things eventually become more interesting and tidy, allowing the reader to speculate who the killer is as the book progresses. The character development was compelling: although most were highly unlikeable, they were real and complicated. Be assured, no “happily ever after people” dwell on these pages.Standout Quotes:“I just think some women aren’t made to be mothers.

100,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57274851-ash,Rating 4 out of 5,"Having just finished Krysten Ritter’s Bonfire, I thought I’d keep the ball rolling and dive into another character-driven mystery starring a female protagonist who left behind her small town to start a new life in Chicago, only to return to investigate a dark mystery. Because apparently I’m super into that. In all seriousness, it’s amazing how two books with such similar premises can create such wildly different reading experiences.Going into Sharp Objects, I was already a fan of Gillian Flynn’s writing, having read and loved Gone Girl. I also had a vague sense of some of the major plot twists from online discussions surrounding the TV adaptation. But even knowing how it would end, I was hooked. I loved the way the story unfurled gradually, taking some confusing twists and turns along the way before reaching its conclusion. Reading a Gillian Flynn novel feels like sinking into quicksand, somehow simultaneously slow and urgent.I didn’t enjoy Sharp Objects quite as much as I enjoyed Gone Girl, which I think had more to do with personal preference than anything objectively wrong with the book. Amy Dunne is such a fascinating character with such a strong voice, and none of the characters in Sharp Objects captivated me the way Amy did. There were some great characters, though, don’t get me wrong. As always, Flynn’s characters were well-developed, deeply flawed but still occasionally sympathetic or at least understandable. As she did in Gone Girl, Flynn managed to make me feel things for her characters that I hadn’t expected to feel and generally evoke emotion in situations that would have fallen flat in the hands of a lesser writer. She is truly a master manipulator.I think what I liked most about Sharp Objects, though, is the ending. Not a lot of writers can execute the perfect ending, but it seems to be one of Flynn’s (many) strong suits. You might not see it coming, but by the time you get there, you realize it was always inevitable. It couldn’t have gone any other way. So, even though the ending is far from a happily ever after tied up in a neat little bow, you still come away satisfied. I love that."

102,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16069171-aditi,Rating 5 out of 5," “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”  ----Leo TolstoyGillian Flynn, an American bestselling author, has penned a terrific and extremely disturbing psycho debut thriller, Sharp Objects that is centered around a virulent family set in a small Missourian town, where a young journalist returns back home to report about the killings of two little girls, but the ghosts from her past start to knock at her door while on the background her twisted and complex mother and her half sister makes it equally difficult to carry on with her job. And Flynn manages to make this book shine bright through the dullness and cracks of a woman's life and by victimizing women, in general. Synopsis: When two girls are abducted and killed in Missouri, journalist Camille Preaker is sent back to her home town to report on the crimes. Long-haunted by a childhood tragedy and estranged from her mother for years, Camille suddenly finds herself installed once again in her family's mansion, reacquainting herself with her distant mother and the half-sister she barely knows - a precocious 13-year-old who holds a disquieting grip on the town. As Camille works to uncover the truth about these violent crimes, she finds herself identifying with the young victims - a bit too strongly. Clues keep leading to dead ends, forcing Camille to unravel the psychological puzzle of her own past to get at the story. Dogged by her own demons, Camille will have to confront what happened to her years before if she wants to survive this homecoming. Let's talk about Camille Preaker. Right in the very beginning of the story, it will give the readers a notion about this charming, independent, smart, career-minded woman with a not-so-happening life yet someone with a steady income working for a second grade newspaper in Chicago. And soon Camille is assigned on a reporting job by her boss back to her hometown in Missouri where the brutal murders of two little girls with all their teeth wrenched out. Camille is reluctant in the beginning, as she needs to face her ""mother"", who is extremely complicated down to her bone and Camille never found that tender love from her own mother, and after the death of her sister, it finally dissolved any chance of reconciliation between this already broken pair of mother daughter bond. Pretty soon, a horrific fact about this perfect yet heart broken protagonist shatters that good girl image from the minds of the readers. Camille inflicts pain on her body with her emotional pain by engraving words that made her psychologically disturbed, all throughout her torso. Now that Camille is back in her wretched childhood home, either she needs to maintain a good relationship with her mother and her half sister, who is unusually mature than her tender age and is a sexually charged up young teenager, or escape the brutality of her unforgettable past. As she gets on with the job of reporting about the two murders, she not only falls for the detective on charge of this case, but also finds an uncanny resemblance to the attitude of the two murdered young girls. Can Camille find out the truth behind the deaths of the two little girls? Honestly speaking, I never before have heard the name of this author, until the craze of Gone Girl that sky-rocketed the sales of Flynn's previous novels. So I had to pick up a copy of the author's previous novels too, as Gone Girl surprised me in a lot of positive ways. If Gone Girl depicted the dark side and victimization of a sweet, romantic marital bond, and Dark Places depicted the twisted mentality of a middle-class farm family, then Sharp Objects depicts the complex and fractured lines that lie deep within the relationship of a psychologically challenged mother and daughter. The one think that makes this author stand out among other bestselling crime fiction/thriller authors is the fact that she devises a story based on an everyday or common relationship and turn it into something dark, Gothic and violent, all the while, screaming out the message that ""violence can be found even among the sweetest and innocent relationships"".The author has used ""women"" is general to project them as the victims of the society, then using those victims, the author has concocted a gripping and bone-chilling thriller, where the ""women"" can across as a violent, extremely manipulative and sadistic beings. So before crossing your own mother or sister, you will be forced to think twice, after reading this book. The spookiness is so real that while reading I Felt the chill deep down into my spines. Hence grab this book only if you are ready to handle darkness, mind games, and complex nature of a mother-daughter relationship with an eerie taste of raw violence. I instantly became mesmerized by Flynn's elegant use of the retrospective voice, which is always questioning its very own accuracy, and exploring the nature of memory, of the narratives that we tell ourselves about ourselves, and others and that will make a direct impact on our minds. Flynn's writing style never disappoints me as her articulate and emotionally strong prose lets me lose myself in its flow. The pacing seems to be quite fast, as the author unravels the hints and twists one after another that felt to me like some sudden blow on my mind. The twists and turns of this book are tightly drawn right from the very start, which often diverts from the main story line of the two murdered girls to the life of the central character and those around her. But then again, these diversion are necessary to let the readers get into the mind of the protagonist and those around her. Flynn's strongest quality lies in characterization who can create completely unlovable and unlikable characters and can eventually make us sympathize with them.The main character, Camille, too is a brilliant example of Flynn's strongest quality, where she first projects her as a pretty perfect young woman, then goes back to reveal the darkest truth about her nature of being a cutter, and as the author starts revealing about her equally twisted past, that will finally make the readers' hearts to be filled with sympathy for this character. Camille's mother is highly distasteful right from the very first page and I could not find any logic behind her weird and dark demeanor and nature of showering her motherly love over her daughters. The supporting characters, like the sister is also well developed and all the while I was reading the book, I felt like each and every female characters from the sister's friends to the dead girl's brother's girlfriend to the mother, everyone is psychologically flawed to the very depth of their soul, and even though I can feel the darkness from their demeanor yet somehow I could not look away from the raw visual imagery that the author strikingly portrayed through each and every scenes. In a nutshell, this is a highly absorbing book that did not once let me turn my head away from the story despite of the book's bone-chilling and spooky aura.Verdict:  Flynn at her best! The best psychological thrilling book penned by Gillian Flynn till this day."

I am bumping this up from 3 stars to 5 for pasting to my reader's soul such a foreboding and stifling atmosphere centered on a bizarre, smothering, and mentally disordered Southern mom and a nosy small town, the death of a sister, as well as for painting, if you will, a ""pink"" rebellion that some girls go through to try to escape via degrading sex, alcohol and drugs. Compared to later life when she is saddled by nightmares and afflictions lurking from the earlier verbal abuse/neglect by a mentally ill mom, by the death of a close sister, and as. a result of the demoralization of bodily degradation in her youth, all of which is further fueled by alcoholism.ORIGINAL 3-Star REVIEWI found this, Gillian Flynn's first novel, foreboding, fairly suspenseful, quite nasty and, in general, unkind to females as a gender. Ms. Flynn showed a mastery of writing *kink* and *dirty girl* into a story. Yet, this novel is notable mostly for showing how much her storytelling skills have improved since.While I'd recommend this novel over much of the drivel flowing from this now-ubiquitous genre, it's still largely mass-market fare that leaves you as quickly as it finds you."

Me resultaba una novela extremadamente creíble y bien llevada. Pareciera llevar tres décadas escribiendo. La historia se centra en un pequeño pueblo, Wind Gap próximo a Chicago. Nuestra protagonista, una reportera con ganas de conseguir su primer gran artículo, regresa a su ciudad natal para investigar el asesinato de dos niñas. La trama parece típica y trillada por su sinopsis, pero nada más lejos de la realidad. No voy a entrar en detalles, porque es un libro que necesita ser descubierto poco a poco. Los horrores que narra Flynn son tan increíbles y horribles, que todavía resulta más increíble que logre darles verosimilitud. Otra cosa importante es que, aún perteneciendo a un género que se disfruta más con grandes giros de acontecimientos y finales soprendentes, este no es el caso de Heridas abiertas. La resolución puede adivinarse con relativa facilidad, pero eso no quita ni un ápice de interés a la novela. No he podido apartar los ojos de las últimas 100 páginas. Me ha intregado terriblemente que la mayoría de los personajes femeninos de esta novela fueran poco menos que la encarnación del mismísimo demonio jajaja. Entro esto y Perdida, intuyo que Flynn ha debido conocer muchas malas mujeres, o es una obsesión recurrente.Lo dicho. Una genia."

107,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1166663-carol,Rating 3 out of 5,"Sharp Objects by Gillian Flynn might have been a good book for a dreary October night. Not because it has ghosts or goblins or that it is Halloweenie but it sure gave me the creeps. Camille Preaker is a so-so reporter with lots of baggage for the fourth largest newspaper in Chicago. Her boss Curry sends Camille home to Wind Gap, MO to write the press for the cold case murder of a young girl who was found strangled with all her teeth pulled out. Now another girl is missing. Camille's idea of happy does not embrace going home but she owes Curry and the job is the job. Up to this point the story sounds like any missing person/murder whodunit. But in the hands of Flynn the book takes some sharp, unsettling turns. This is one dark story. There's truly nasty, damaged souls in these pages, people I'm happy not to know. It's a compliment to Flynn that the story disturbed me as much as it did. I won't soon forget the plot, the characters or the outcome. Sharp Objects did make me squirm but I respect Flynn's writing. One passage I loved and will keep is this:""Natalie was buried in the family plot, next to a gravestone that already bore her parents' names. I know the wisdom, that no parents should see their child die, that such an event is like nature spun backward. But it's the only way to truly keep your child. Kids grow up, they forge more potent allegiances. They find a spouse or lover. They will not be buried with you. The Keene's, however, will remain the purest form of family. Underground.""Beautiful!Three stars because I can't say ""I really liked"" Sharp Objects. I read it to the end even though my senses were assaulted. I put Flynn's second book, Dark Places, on my TBR list. I need to read what this writer served up the second time around."

I hear the movie was good but didn't watch it. I thought I would try this book and still not a big fan of her writing style but I really enjoyed the plot. Good atmosphere if you like dark and depressing! But she did it well! I prefer a humorous book but I am trying to go outside my comfort zone. This had a lot of things outside my comfort zone that if I had known before hand I would not have read this book and tried something else. A severely tormented woman writer is the main character but once the reader finds out why she is depressed, well, this reader wanted to bleach her brain to get it all out! Everything I really hate about a book is in here. Child abuse, rape, and I guess the only thing missing was animal abuse! But they were on a pig slaughter farm and I am a vegetarian so there's that. There are chapters that are long and boring. Some chapters are very dark and dreadfully tense. Did I enjoy the book? No. Did I find it entertaining? Yes and no.

It was engaging but also gave itself room to breathe and really sucked me into the small town Missouri setting. Now, it’s Gillian Flynn, so you know things are gonna get dark and twisted... and they do. My biggest complaint is that a lot of that stuff felt unnecessary and unbelievable. It’s like watching Game of Thrones where they can’t just hurt or kill someone. It’s gonna be shocking and oh my god can you believe that kind of stuff. Also, the sister in this story... Amma... just didn’t seem like a 13 year old... even with all the stuff going on. Hey, and also, I knew the ending before I got there and I was pretty bummed about it. I usually don’t do that or even try to guess, but I got to the end and was like well yeah of course that’s what happened. I saw it coming all along. Oh well. As a police detective journalist dark romance coming of age story, this is pretty solid. It goes down some dark roads a few times, but ultimately left me feeling like the HBO miniseries should be interesting. Isn’t that why we all read books? So we can spoil tv shows and movies? "

I have heard a lot about her other book Gone Girl and have also read some reviews stating that Sharp Objects is much better than the former.I had no idea from the blurb why this book is called Sharp Objects. Stupid of me I guess to not have guessed it!This is fast paced but in few places the writing is a bit abrupt. This is a good thriller but I had a few issues with the ending which I will come to later on in this review.**Mild Spoilers Ahead** Our main protagonist Camille has a habit of self-harming (cutting) herself. She is a journalist with Grade B newspaper in Chicago. There has been a murder in her hometown of a young girl and another girl is missing resulting her in going back to Wind Gap to cover this story. Camille as the main protagonist was unlikable (at least for me) and through the course of this story does some highly questionable stuff (self-harm excluded). Her relationship with her mother (Adora) is not very good and added to that Camille has not recovered from the death of her sister (Marian). The relation between Mother and daughter is really strained and makes us wonder who is at fault here. There are spots where I felt the Adora is really cold but then everything we see is through Camille's perception and it is difficult to trust everything solely based on her point of view... And then there is Amma- Camille's step-sister. She is the most twisted and unbalanced teenager I have ever come across. She is a queen bee outside her house but behaves like a toddler in front of her parents. Being a kid, she taunts Camille and the Investigating Officer (Richard). She has a mean bone and is definitely a Sadist... On top of all that at such a young age she is into sex and drugs. Some of the things in this story were truly appalling. There is the typical bunch of characters that are expected in a small town and ample of gossip among residents. Apart from the family issues and tensions there is the investigation of murder and maybe a serial killer at loose. 
The story brings out all the negative aspects of human nature and there are no characters in the book who you feel like rooting for.
 My problem with the ending is : So, Amma turns out to be the killer but she is just 13 yrs old and has killed two girls with the help of her friends in Wind Gap. I have heard some horror stories where pack of teenage girls are responsible for bullying & killing a girl but it is almost immediately apparent and they are caught as after all they are no mastermind. But in this story even after 2 murders, the police are unable to catch the girls and even more surprising that the other girls involved did not squeal. The ending was unrealistic and hard to believe."
116,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42055091-dilushani-jayalath,Rating 3 out of 5,"I would have loved to write paragraphs over paragraphs on this novel. That is how I envisioned as I first picked it up. I did not think it will trickle down to slow flow. Let’s be honest. Anyone with a brain would have figured out the killer by the first 25% of the book. There was no moment where you’d be shocked by the turn of events. It was evident from the beginning who could be bringing this chaos to the silent not so prominent town (honestly, there are many non-silent acts happening behind doors but that’s for another day). The town of Wind Gap is messed up. In the type where it is kept buried down. No one willing to bring it up, everyone rather having it in the vestibule of their backyard buried 6 feet under. Ultimately the murder of two young girls brings the attention to this small town. Does it shock it? Yes from the outside everyone seems to be shocked to their bones but on the inside? They know they do worse things at their own homes. Viciousness of humans have no end. If we put our minds we can go to the worst condition our minds can put us in, it can make us do things others might not believe possible. You might try and say no but you all know it is possible. This was a case of mind taking over reason. At the end did the author clarify what happened? What cause all of this? Childhood trauma? For me these questions left unanswered really left a sour taste in my mouth. I wanted much more concrete answers. I felt how everything was brushed under the rug with the maybe answer for all being psychological childhood trauma didn’t satisfy me. At the end I was bored of the conclusion. Funnily enough it was only John the young boy who held the least bit of liking to him. The characters themselves were horrible, the mood gloomy and felt like a B-rated cop movie. "
117,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50620706-alaina,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book was weird and kept me flip-flopping on who actually committed the damn murder.Sharp Objects is about Camille Preaker, who is a reporter, going back to her home town to write a story about some murders. Of course, this does put a damper on her life because she barely talks to her mother or family down there. This is mostly because they don't have the best relationship or communication skills. I feel like that whole town is weird, but her family is 100% weirder.Not going to lie, I definitely kept flip-flopping between her mom and half-sister as the killers. They were just way too weird and craved attention. Their mom was basically only attentive to them when they were hurt or sick. She did end up killing Camille's real sister when they were younger (no surprise there) but she was practically trying to kill Camille and half-sister. Speaking of the spawn from satan, I think her name was Adda? Amma? Whatever her name was - she screamed trouble. She was either annoying me with how needy she was or how childish she acted. It was either let me be the center of attention or die. Camille definitely faces her demons in this book to uncover the truth about her sister's past. It was very dark when she realized what her mom actually did. The amount of lies and betrayal in this book definitely kept it a page turner. Plus I just really wanted to know who was killing these kids!Overall, it was really good. No, I'm not going to spoil who did it. Pretty sure this is my favorite book by Gillian so far."

122,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline,Rating 4 out of 5,"***SPOILERS HIDDEN***The most noteworthy thing about Sharp Objects is that it’s as much an “issues book” as it is a mystery. This isn’t a conventional thriller-type of mystery with lots of action. No, a creepy mystery and an exploration of psychiatric disorder and addiction here share space to tell a unique tale. Sharp Objects is told from the perspective of Camille Preaker, a Chicago police reporter who’s returned to her small hometown of Wind Gap to report on--investigate, really--the bizarre murders of two pre-teen girls. In a stereotypical depiction of small-town life, Gillian Flynn made it obvious why Camille fled this town years ago. Wind Gap is insular to a fault, stifling, and gossipy. The residents are phony, and few of them move away. They like it that way. These insufferable people are engrossing to read about, if one-dimensional. What doesn’t work is the character of Camille. Though she’s a fascinating protagonist, she doesn’t make sense. She can hold down a demanding job as a Chicago reporter but is crippled by alcoholism and a serious psychiatric disorder. Also really problematic is a missing link between her dysfunction and the mystery itself. The idea is that her disturbed mother has scarred her for life, figuratively and literally, but this plot thread is too dominant to be left unconnected. This debut by Flynn isn’t too ambitious but not so simple that it’s predictable. The book is dark; however, it isn’t dark because of gruesomeness. It’s dark because its intensity never abates and because very little about it isn’t unsettling. Many characters--main and secondary alike--are frightening, extremely weird, or have their own psychiatric issues. Somehow it all really works, and at an economical 252 pages, Flynn kept Sharp Objects to-the-point and cleanly organized. Best of all, it’s surprising right up to the end. "

Sometimes it is all too loud.


So yeah, we're back at it again with the thrillers. To be fair, this is more a reread, but let's pretend this review really comes out of nowhere. Since I heard the tv show is good and I really want to watch it, I decided to try the book again first.Actually, believe it or not, I didn't remember much of it. I didn't even remember the ending. And thank goodness I didn't may I say. It's like my brain purposely deleted those last seven pages to gift me with the pleasure of a narrative twist once again. Seriously, I can't get enough. I was so engrossed with it, I didn't even notice the last page roll by. Gillian Flynn has this weird effect on me. Every single word she writes is like a page-turner bait that's just waiting for me to lower my guard even just a little, only to suck me into the story with more strenght than necessary.It shook me to the core. And, again, this wasn't even my first time reading it. Plus, there's a veiled (but maybe not too much) message squeezed in between the lines and it screams out loud in favor of all those women who suffer, all those women who are survivors of things that were too out of their control. I think the thing I like the most about her books is that everyone (E V E R Y O N E) and everything is so over the top and exquisely fucked up that you can't fault yourself for liking characters and situations that could be considered problematic in our average everyday society rule book. You know what I learned, though? You're perfectly allowed to like books like these. You're allowed to feel like there's something infinitely satisfying in being able to freely sympathize with flawed characters. Being able to connect with fictional people who are morally on the darkest side of the shades of gray scale and perceiving it almost as a challenge. It should be like this, because we all need and deserve a reminder that we're all human. Sometimes really wonderful, but sometimes really ugly, too. Who more and who less, who for the better and who for the worst, sure, but humans in spite of that. And not the perfect gods' creation the tumblr propaganda wants us to pretend we are. I love Camille. I personally reason with her idea of feminism a lot (for the same reasons I quoted before: a woman should be allowed to admit she is/feels weak, without feeling like she's belittling herself or her sisters. It just comes with the human-with-feelings-and-a-serious-case-of-self-boundaries package, and we're all born with it), and I find her relatable in ways that go past one's personal story. She's this damaged soul that has trouble looking for a place to call home, a family to call her own and some light to brighten up her life. ""Watching"" her crumble and stand up back again is awesome. A bit triggering (I really wouldn't recomment GF's books to whoever is suffering from severe anxiety, anyway), but seriously awesome. But after all, nobody rises from their ashes like one of Flynn's women."

Cry Baby ist ein sensationeller Krimi der von der Stimmung her sehr düster aufgebaut ist. Mit vielen punktgenauen psychologischen Analysen wird im Prinzip ala Stephen King ein Kleinstadtmilieu komplett mit allen Figuren, beziehungsweise fast allen Einwohnern ihren Verflechtungen, der Vergangenheit, ihrer Traumata und kleinen Problemche und dem Klatsch und Tratsch konzipiert. Zusätzlich sind die Locations auch so liebevoll beschrieben, dass man als Leser*In meint, direkt dabei zu sein.Der Plot ist auch grandios, mein Anfangs-Verdacht stimmte zwar irgendwie, aber dann auch wieder nicht so ganz, die Motivlage habe ich nur teilweise erraten. Auf jeden Fall gabs auch für mich am Ende eine kleine Überraschung. Da ich schon ein paarmal gefragt wurde, ob ich finde, dass Cry Baby besser als Gone Girl ist. Die Handlung ist weniger rasant als in Gone Girl, aber Cry Baby war psychologisch noch um eine Nuance tiefer, mit sehr argen Szenen, weshalb ich für zärter Besaitete eine Triggerwarnung aussprechen möchte. Ich fand beide Romane annähernd gleich gut, aber wenn Euch das Tempo wichtig ist, werdet Ihr Cry Baby ein bisschen schlechter finden. Sehr gut ist der Roman allemal, es sei, denn man hätte Probleme mit unsympathischen Protagonisten und echt argen Familiengeschichten.Fazit: Ein grandioser, konsistenter, runder und spannender Krimi im Kleinstadtmillieu, psychologisch und sprachlich brillant entworfen, die Figuren sehr tief entwickelt. Großes Kino 🍿, bravo!"

""Sharp Objects"" is a haunting read. Part of me knew from experience with Gillian Flynn's stories that I'd be in for a tale with many dark twists and turns aligned with some dark humor and dark social commentary. This book was, to me, darker and more sinister than ""Gone Girl."" Perhaps not as compulsive in terms of finding out what exactly happened, but certainly pulling me forward.Camille is a reporter from Chicago returning to her hometown after rumors of a purported serial killer targeting young girls reaches her struggling newspaper. Her boss assigns her the case, she reluctantly returns home, meets up with a mother who's more than just overly doting (though dysfunctional would be a severe understatement). As Camille struggles to do her job, she finds that the truth is far worse than what she could speculate, even having some ties with the demons she's tried to escape from her past. Flynn has a talent for beginning a story with an interesting cover for intrigue, like a prime piece of fruit. Only when you peel back the layers, you discover the degree of how rotten it is, and it doesn't skimp on the details of making you see every bit of its decay. Every single character in this book has secrets, every single one of them is flawed or messed up in some way. There's drug use, sex, abuse, cruelty even from the younger characters and how they treat each other. What makes it more than just a portrait of the worst aspects of its characters is how detailed and complex the character studies are with social context that goes beyond the expected. You understand even the motivations of the minor characters and their part in the greater scheme of the events that revolve around the murder mystery here. Even Camille, who comes across as a sympathetic protgaonist for the horrible abuse and shame she's carried for her external and internal scars, constantly seeks sources of comfort and acceptance in the wrong places and confronting her realities seem to open up more holes for that pain to show through. As she uncovers more clues into the deaths of the girls and the past of the town she's lived in, it's tied to her experiences and perceptions There's pain in her experiences as well as what seems to be a larger commentary of the contradictory labels that women have in society (since this was written before ""Gone Girl"" - I could definitely see where the root of that commentary had influences and definition to color the latter work, just in a different way.)I have a hard time saying that I liked this novel or that it's even a favorite because the experience gutted me and was so dark that I found myself taking breaks from it even through a well-narrated audio version (performed by Anne Marie Lee). Yet I found myself pulled into the experience of this novel through how well written, well-dimensioned, and thought-provoking the narrative was as a whole, including with the way the mystery unveiled eventually. I probably should've expected as much for the ending to have the well-tied resolution, but resonate with the dark tone in its ending alongside the overarching color of the work as a whole.I can certainly say that Flynn is an author I really want to read more from in the future, though.Overall score: 4/5 stars."
132,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Out of the three Gillian Flynn books, this one is by FAR the creepiest—and I mean that in a good way! Reporter Camille returns to the hometown she hasn't visited in years for an article about a possible serial killer of young girls. Camille's mother is cold and manipulative, her 13yo half sister that she's never met before is a budding Lolita, and Camille's own demons are swiftly coming back to haunt her. Camille never comes home, and she wouldn't have come now, except her editor insisted--he thinks her being a local girl will give her an edge. As the novel progresses, we learn more about Camille's own psychological issues, and feel a growing horror for her childhood and her family—all the while clues are coming in about the murdered young girls. You feel the need to find out what happened, but you gradually feel that that knowledge will come with a price. Camille is a likeable protagonist, and you are definitely on her side from the beginning. The majority of the other characters in the book are less appealing. Interestingly, even the murdered girls are not portrayed as perfect saints, but are shown with warts and all. I enjoyed this, I found the people were much more believable and human than books where everybody is either good or bad with nothing in between. This book is disturbing and involving at the same time. It will keep you up at night finishing it, then prevent you from sleeping after! Recommend to anyone who likes thrillers, especially dark ones!"

It was about as ""unputdownable"" as I have encountered in a quite a long time.Camille made for such an interesting character. Flynn created a small town world I could feel. And Adora was an understated, yet compelling figure. She was a complex and fear inspiring villain because not only was she bad, but an even worse villain because she spawned another horrific villain, Amma. And yet not just a one-dimensional character. You had a sense of Adora's backstory that then created all the bad things she did to Camille. To me, it was like Camille was a survivor, but one who had not emerged unscathed. But strong because she didn't and hadn't succumbed to things as either an adult or as a kid when it might have been ""easier"" to do so. Anyway, this was 252 pages of well worth the time and I highly recommend it. "

It's full of shocking twists and turns, while also taking its time to really delve into the characters' psyches in a really fascinating, yet disturbing way. I was entirely immersed, disgusted and surprised. Highly recommended, if you feel like you can handle very explicit content (also trigger warning for self harm).

137,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12460952-bill-kupersmith,Rating 5 out of 5,"The final episode started so slowly that I feared we’d not manage to conclude, but then we wrapped up very fast. Assessing the series, I regard the uneven pace at which the story unfolds to be its worst artistic flaw. No relationship between how long a scene lasted and its importance to the plot. Useless material like the Calhoon Days celebration consumed much of an episode but the fate of the characters is terribly truncated. Which is a shame because we really care about them. And there’s where the difference between a thriller and real tragedy differ. Even since I first read the book, I was sure Sharp Objects had real tragic stature because I really cared about Camille. Still, as a great acting gig, this series was absolutely superb, first for Amy Adams and the principals but then for everybody. And the scenes were delicious – shot in true cinema verité style. But it was still television, which hasn’t caught up to where musical theatre was at the end of the 19th century or cinema by the 1960s. They don’t know how to put a production together as a unified whole. Some examples: As in the book Curry tells Camille to “hop a plane home” but apparently the script writers forgot that home had been moved from Chicago to St. Louis and in a previous episode we’d seen a sign giving the distance from Wind Gap to St. Louis as 90 miles. No idea why the video made that change, but making Camille’s base Chicago in the book made her more of a stranger when she returns. Which reminds me – the parallels between Sharp Objects and Get Carter are fascinating – the book could have been titled Camille’s Return Home. Why do we end with Camille’s discovery of the teeth? I thought we should have found out what happened to Amma as in the book, not to mention the contents of Adora’s medicine cabinet. And I’m still wondering about the names. Are Adora and Amma the results of the family’s trying to give them proper upper-class names and being too drunk to spell Eudora and Emma, or were they nouveau riches who thought that unconventional spellings would class them up? Also thought the parting between Richard and Camille (“sorry for everything”) was too bland – I thought Richard a total jerk for dropping Camille when he found out she was a cutter. A real man would have found her just that much more interesting.Final verdict: A triumph for the actors and the photography, but not for the writers. In six episodes it could have been super. Four stars. (Book is still five!)"

I was one of those people that loved Gone Girl, but I have been kind of struggling with Flynn's other novels I have read for some reason. Thankfully though, I ended up really liking this one and it was totally and completely wild and crazy town AF. I can't even imagine how this story is going to come across on TV, and now that I'm done I will have to watch it very soon. I was also shocked to find out this is actually Flynn's debut novel, and I have 0 idea as to why I always thought that it was Gone Girl.I was also a big fan of the audiobook which is narrated by Ann Marie Lee, and it goes pretty quickly considering it's just over 9.5 hours long. This book is DARK y'all and there is a plethora of heavy and disturbing themes all captured with seemingly perfect ease by Flynn. The characters have so much dimension that even those you should completely hate become too real to ignore, and I loved the way the twists shocked me. Since it's been a minute, I might actually read this one again before watching the limited series, but if you are a fan of dark and disturbing Sharp Objects is the place to be."

LESS THAN A REVIEW:

“Macbeth: How does your patient, doctor?Doctor: Not so sick, my lord, as she is troubled with thick-coming fancies that keep her from rest.Macbeth: Cure her of that! Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased, pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow, raze out the written troubles of the brain, and with some sweet oblivious antidote cleanse the stuffed bosom of that perilous stuff which weighs upon her heart.Doctor: Therein the patient must minister to himself.”
-Shakespeare (Macbeth)As I finished with this one, I came to see the craze surrounding the author at once, and all I can say is that it’s well deserved. I read her Grownups just a few months ago, and parts of Gone Girl when the movie had come out, basically because I try pick up every novel which becomes a David Fincher adaptation. Sharp Objects, notwithstanding its negatives, is still one of the best “small town” suspense thrillers that I’ve come across by a present-day author. However, it has none of the heartwarming charisma that you expect from a small-town novel, it’s quite to the contrary. It’s gruesome, gloomy, unfaithful and quite prone to get your spine chilling for a number of times, and that’s probably much more than what you can ask from a psychological thriller. Also, I got to know a great deal more about MBP (Munchausen’s by Proxy) in here than probably I’d have in any article. It also delineates the urgency to give voice to your psychiatric problems in a much more serious tone than the ones I have come across recently.
“A child weaned on poison considers harm a comfort.”
But I can simply say that I took my best decision in here by watching the drama series first. For quite a number of reasons:1.	The amazing performances, least of all the protagonist by Amy Adams, and also Patricia Clarkson, which proved helpful when I turned to the novel in its much bleak state. Camille Preaker won’t have been a character you could’ve remembered otherwise, I daresay. 2.	The momentary flashbacks, which were enough to give you the creeps most of the times, surprising for how frequent they were. Well, you can also feel the tension building up in the novel, but it’s never the same.3.	The bizarre point at which the last episode ended, with the shocking revelation that can leave the best of us dumbfounded, disregarding the clues given from the first. The novel carried on for a great deal more, so it won’t have you thinking as much as the series did, which is exceptional. I like my stories to leave some scope for self-interpretation.4.	The characters were given a tad bit more shades, which increased the complexity quite a bit. So much so that at times it may feel closer to a dysfunctional family drama than a sometimes-stifling psychological thriller.5.	It didn’t take as much time to read the book, as it took to watch the “miniseries”! That’s also aberrational, for one of the many reasons one prefers a book is that it isn’t over within the 2-3 hours it takes to watch its adaptation.That’s some of the facts I felt necessitated pointing out. Gillian Flynn is also involved in the production of the television series, and for some reasons I feel that’s where her prowess shows off more, with a tad more audacity. Conclusively, I won’t tell you not to read it, of course; but if you have time for only one, it’s better off dedicated to the adaptation.

142,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52545435-elle-ellexamines,Rating 2 out of 5,"Actual rating: 2.5 stars. I realized this was going to be a mixed-feelings book from the beginning and I thought that all the way through. So here I am with an exact middle-of-the-road rating. TW: self-harm, sexual content, violent illness, pretty much everything imaginable? (this does not impact my rating)Flynn is known for her intense psychology and her keen understanding of people. I don't deny those things are somewhat true. What I don't get is how you can take such a fabulous mystery idea and make the ending so obvious. Admittedly, I didn't totally anticipate the final twist. But it was my second choice for a solution. This book really failed to shock me, even with its eerie atmosphere. I do have to give some props to Flynn for her character work. Our lead character, Camille, is definitely compelling; if I hadn't hated the writing so much, I'm sure I would've been even more invested in her. She's effortlessly interesting even when she's a terrible person. Perhaps it's just that this is a debut novel, but I found Flynn's style extremely messy and disjointed. There's no denying she's talented; her descriptions are almost viscerally terrifying. But this 250-page book put me in a reading slump. I can't forgive that. I can't. I found this actively painful to read. The final 150 pages of Sharp Objects quite literally took me three hours to read. That's my average reading speed cut in half. I call bullshit. There's one more issue picking at my brain: Gillian Flynn has a weird relationship with other women. I appreciate her dedication to terrifying lady villains. I don't disagree with her claim that we need good ones. I also don't think the fact that her female characters are all terrible should have bearing; all her characters are terrible people. It's a function of her work and her beliefs about humanity. (Different topic I'd also like to address.) However, this book has a defined misogynistic tone to it; in fact, every girl is either a villain or a bimbo. Or both. The only possible exceptions to this are Camille and Amma, and even Amma fits this trope; she's just got some development on top of it. I think my problem with this book is that I can't tell what moral Flynn is going for: are women objects that get consumed, that love the attention of being ill? Or was that comment the work of an unreliable narrator? The protagonist, Camille, is certainly not the most reliable of mouthpieces. We know that what she says about her experience with the football team towards the beginning isn't entirely true. You've all seen the quote; in one scene, a man says a 13-year-old girl being passed around to have sex with four senior boys is rape, and Camille calls his claim sexist. Camille later on says she had “never realized until now how young that is.” It's not a reach to say Camille was guarding herself by faking apathy. But was that Flynn's intention? I don't know. Not sure I want to, either. VERDICT: Clunky writing killed an otherwise pretty good book. Even that ending wouldn't have really bothered me without that freaking writing. I'd recommend testing out her writing in this book before picking this up. I've heard from a few reviewers she improves, so don't judge off her other books. And good luck!!"
143,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26874718-effy,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book was even more disturbing and twisted than Gone Girl. It is an amalgamation of profanity, secularization, murder, child abuse, self-harm and sexualization of children. Therefore, it is not for the faint of heart.The story follows Camille, a reporter who is being sent back to her small hometown to investigate the murders of two little girls who were both struggled and had their teeth removed without any insinuation of sexual assault. She is addicted to self-mutilation, carving words into her skin, covering every inch of her flesh with the indelible marks of her suffering. As repressed memories of the death of her sister are reemerging and waves of unresolved feelings are washing away any hopes of her leading a normal life with her mother and half-sister, Camille ends up back in the rabbit hole, getting dragged in a series of murders shrouded in mystery. Is she closer to finding the psycho-killer on the loose than she had thought?I hated the mother with a vengeance. She suffered from Munchausen by Proxy syndrome and liked indulging in harmful behavior, smothering subservient children with torture so that she could take care of them. The half-sister was pathologically sinister. The protagonist's fragile state of mind and self-destructive behavior made this book exceedingly difficult to read. I cannot think of a single character that was not problematic.This story depicts women as villains, promiscuous, belligerent and perpetrators and men as pawns in their sick games. I appreciated this refreshing twist on the conventional female frailty. It's as if the author sided with those who hold the view that human nature is devoid of benevolence. Everyone seems to be in a stat of wretchedness ad depravity. Even sex is only employed as a means of escape.This book kind of reminded me of Darling Rose Gold in terms of the Munchausen by Proxy syndrome. I would still recommend this book though over the latter since it delves deeper into the psyche of a mentally ill person, skillfully portraying how one reacts to abuse."

How can a thriller be so static? And give you 0% of excitment where? I've never read such a bad thriller novel. This book is awful, and all the anti-feminism in it?? What the hell?? Sorry, not sorry, but when I see a woman bashing feminism I'm 100% done with her.Examples: when Camille came at Angie's and one of those girls was like ""don't let feminists *looks at camille* blah blah"".OR when one of them was ""my husband doesn't want any more kids, he says three is enough"", and her friend is like ""is it enough for you"". BITCH if it were the other way round, husband wanting more children and wife saying no, everyone would be losing shit that how dare she say no to more children. Sorry, but this pissed me so much!THEN there's Camille who's apparently a feminish and then she DARES to say something along ""strongly believing or loving the phrase 'she got what she deserved'.... Do I even need to explain myself on this one?????Second, there is literally no plot, only bunch of gross and extemely detailed things that have you sitting an worrying about the mental health of the author herself. The plot is so lame and uninteresting that I can't believe I wated two days of my life reading this bullshit.Third thing that pissed me off was Camille herself. She's a 30 year old woman, yet she goes out and gets drunk and does drugs with her THIRTEEN YEAR OLD stepsister!?!?!?!? I'm sorry Camille, but what the fuck???? Then, few chapters after she flirts with an EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD boy and ends up fucking him in a motel room?!??!??! Honestly, I think Camille is the biggest criminal here.This book started of as 2 stars for me, because even though there was no plot, my sick self liked all those extremely detailed gross stuff, but the more I read the more two stars seemed too high... Hell, one stars seems too high. This is a complete fucking zero. I never called book a garbage.. but this is garbage."

But at the same time, it's everything I expected from Gillian Flynn. It's everything I wanted. And I loved it. The atmosphere Flynn creates right from the start of the book is exceptionally chilling. I had to put this book down whilst reading it late at night. If you are familiar with Flynn's writing, you'll know exactly why. She successfully creates and builds on these extremely complex and flawed characters, and it as if nothing is going too far with her writing. To tell you the truth - I get scared over everything. Honestly, ask anyone who knows me and they will tell you. I cannot stand scary stories. I refuse to watch horror movies. I get scared when leaving my room at night. I cried during Donnie Darko (That's the scariest movie I've seen). To put it straight: I am not tough. At all. I hate frightening things. However; That is completely not the case with this book. Don't get me wrong - It's disturbing. But what do you expect when picking up a book written by Gillian Flynn? Although disturbing, her writing is fantastic. I cannot praise it enough. After loving Gone Girl, I knew I had to pick up another book by her. I was definitely not let down. I gave it four stars because I felt like something bigger was going to happen the entire time. If you've read this, I probably sound insane. I just felt like I was waiting for something of a greater extent to happen; and it never came. I saw the ending coming from a mile away. HOWEVER, that's completely my opinion. It may be different for you! Although predictable, this was still a phenomenal book.I completely enjoyed this novel, and I definitely recommend it if you're looking for a book that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Gillian Flynn will not let you down."

152,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5717792-scott-rhee,Rating 4 out of 5,"When it’s revealed that the protagonist of Gillian Flynn’s debut novel, “Sharp Objects” is a cutter---a girl with a pathological need to scar her body with cuts---it’s actually the LEAST disturbing part of the story. Up to that point, so many other horrible things have happened to the protagonist that one can almost understand why she does it. Almost.I think men may have a harder time digesting this novel than women, mainly because it’s dealing with issues that most men don’t understand, if they are even aware that they exist. If that sounds in any way sexist, it’s probably because it is. Don’t get me wrong: I’m not intentionally trying to sound sexist, but I fully admit that there are things about women I don’t fully understand. Because let me be perfectly honest here: men and women are different. We all know this to be true. The physical differences are easy to see. It’s the psychological differences that trip us up. To say that men and women think or react in the same way is to completely negate and deny those differences.Camille Preaker, the protagonist of “Sharp Objects”, has a complicated history of traumatic incidents and completely unhealthy methods of dealing with that trauma. Despite all this, she seems like a relatively normal woman. She is a smart 20-something career-minded female working as a reporter for a small Chicago newspaper. She has cultivated a strong friendly-but-professional relationship with her editor, and she seems to be well-liked by her colleagues. One would never guess how totally and completely fucked-up, psychologically, she really is. Therein lies the most disturbing part of the story: how well some people, especially women, seem to be able to hide the excruciating pain that they feel on a constant basis. There is an expression that says that females are the deadlier of the species. They are also probably the stronger, mentally. This thought came to mind as I finished the book and wondered, would I be strong enough to survive the same adversity and chaos that is thrown at Camille? As a man, I don’t think I even have the cognitive mechanisms to deal with some of these issues. Camille, on the other hand, has had to deal with them. While she may not have had the proper cognitive coping mechanisms either, clearly she has made do with whatever she could find to compensate, even if it has left her in a very fragile state of sanity.When her editor suggests that she report on a murder of a young girl in her small home town of Wind Gap, Missouri, which would necessitate her actually going back to visit, she doesn’t exactly jump at the chance. She has no interest in seeing her family. She and her mother were not close, to say the least, and her stepfather and teenaged stepsister are complete strangers to her. Besides that, the town and her home hold too many sad memories of her beloved little sister who died of illness at a young age. Despite her better judgment, she agrees to do it.She is in town for only a short time before another murder occurs, another young girl. The local police now have a serial killer on their hands and one with a very bizarre m.o.: the killer extracts all of the girls teeth. The police profile is a male, possibly living within the city. As Camille begins to dig further, however, she uncovers some dark truths about her town and her own personal past. Her investigation reveals a posse of extremely “mean girls” roaming the local middle school hallways, led by her extremely troubled stepsister, Amma. Not only that, but Camille’s troubled relationship with her mother rekindles memories of her little sister, Marion, which suggest that Marion’s death may have been something other than the natural one she has always considered a given.Flynn builds tension well, but she seems truly adept at creating an atmosphere of blood-curdling creepiness and horror, especially by turning upside down some of the basic “truths” about women: that girls are sugar and spice and everything nice, and that all mothers have a natural instinct for loving and protecting their daughters.Ironically, I have heard some critics claim that Flynn is a sexist, and I can see where these critics may be getting that, but I don’t agree with that criticism. I suppose if Flynn were a man, the criticisms would be stronger, and “Sharp Objects” could almost be described as “misogynistic”. The truth is, what Flynn is doing in her novel is perhaps more honest and much less “sexist” than the critics who feel that she is betraying women by making some of them look vicious, deceptive, and sociopathic. Indeed, some of the issues Flynn tackles in the book---female bullying, for one---have, until recently, nearly been dismissed by the general public as “girls being girls”, when, in fact, bullying and its emotionally destructive effects among girls does not have to be inevitable. Those who turn a blind eye to it in the name of political correctness are the ones invariably making it worse.I recommend “Sharp Objects” for fans of psychological thrillers, but it is much more than that. There will be some who hate the book for the very reasons that I found it to be fascinating and enlightening, and for that---and the important discussions it raises---I applaud Flynn. "

So much so that I felt it just wasn’t realistic. Perhaps I’ve just lived a sheltered life but for all this to happen in one town cannot be normal. It was just too far fetched. None of the characters were particularly likeable either so I wasn’t that hooked! Overall, it was an okay read and I think I may have enjoyed it more if I had had more time to really get into it. Trigger warnings include self-harm and sexual abuse."

Gillian Flynn really excels in psychological thrillers, she knows the female brain and how to extract the most vile parts and proudly displays them in her books, she does not spare her readers. This being a totally disturbing and uncomfortable read from the first few pages to the very end. Although you feel gross and dirty for reading it, she also knows how to hook you in and your compelled to keep on reading, I’ve read all her books now ending with her first published book, it’s been awhile between new material so I’m just hoping she’s in the process of writing more, I await eagerly.."

It's sort of like eavesdropping on a conversation your ears shouldn't be privy to. Gillian Flynn has a knack at delving into the dark side of the human psyche on whom, outwardly, appear to be normal people. I don't want to give away any spoilers but I will say that one of the characters in this book had me gritting my teeth.....and coming back for more. For as much as I hated this person I had to know what diabolical thing they would do next. I would highly recommend this."

I will however talk about the author. This was the debut book from Gillian Flynn, author of Gone Girl. For a debut book I thought this was a good psychological mystery. Even with this first book Flynn has a way of making you want to turn pages. She seems to have this evil, demonic, bad -to-the-bone vibe throughout all her work. Her characters are not especially likeable people - even the good ones. But characters that you somehow become vested in. Flynn takes the bad out of the world and dangles it in your face, daring you to determine the outcome. She is an author that sees the world through the darkest elements of humanity, yet as a reader you cannot lay down her book. "

161,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/752176-vanessa,Rating 4 out of 5,"I have stretched out my Gillian Flynn reading for as long as I can, because prolific she ain't. Since she wrote this novel, her debut, in 2006, she's only written two more (which, like this one, you've most likely heard of: Gone Girl and Dark Places), plus a short story which appears in the anthology Rogues. But alas, I have come to where her shelf dead ends. For now.(However if you want more Gillian, she is the showrunner of the new Amazon series, Utopia.)It's both objects and the often objectified characters who are sharp-edged in this story of a Chicago journalist reluctantly being sent back to her small hometown in Missouri (if it's Gillian Flynn, it's always Missouri) to investigate what appears to be the serial murder of two young girls. Camille Preaker, fresh out of a psychiatric hospital, is in no rush to return to a town and family that holds so many bad memories and destructive impulses for her but isn't in a position to say no. Nor is she eager to stay with her distant and domineering mother, vacant stepfather, and her Bad Seed-ish young half-sister whom she barely knows.And because it's Gillian Flynn, the murders are grisly (there is also a section about a factory farm that I had to skip over), the dysfunction is juicy, the authorly sleight of hand is ingenious, the musings on women's place in this world are thought-provoking, and the prose is as pointed as the title:""Camille. Come sit."" She beckoned her cloudy hands toward me. ""No....you can have a drink with your Mother. With your Mother.""This should be miserable, I murmured as I grabbed a tumbler. But underneath that, a thought: time alone with her! A leftover rattle from childhood. Get that fixed. My mother poured recklessly but perfect, capping off my glass just before it overflowed.......""I think I finally realized why I don't love you,"" she said. I knew she didn't, but I'd never heard her admit as much. I tried to tell myself I was intrigued, like a scientist on the edge of a breakthrough, but my throat closed up and I had to make myself breathe.""You remind me of my mother. Joya. Cold and distant and so, so smug. My mother never loved me, either. And if you girls won't love me, I won't love you.""Damn. And so maybe because of this deep familial wound, I can forgive Camille for making some increasingly poor (but entertaining) choices as the story progresses. I really enjoyed this as the story wound back and forth because Flynn is just so good at pulling the strings on the reader with a narrative so compelling the mystery is almost a bonus. It's impossible to rate where this stands with her other books, although a number of people have told me this one is their favorite. I do recommend them all."

Sometimes when you let people do things to you, you’re really doing it to them.
I have found that Gillian Flynn does not pull punches with her characters. They are so flawed that at times they might even be hard to like. While in other novels I’ve read characters might have a slight personality flaw or some baggage from their past Gillian Flynn says nope that isn’t interesting enough and she turns the volume on her characters issues up to 11.Camille, now a reporter in Chicago, came from a small town and a very dysfunctional family. She lost her sister tragically when she was thirteen and that is when she started acting out. You would think that now that she is almost thirty she would have worked most of that out, but she hasn’t and it has taken a toll on her life and her body. Camille is a cutter and not just a simple cutter no she goes to extremes and has words on almost every inch of her body that she has been cutting into herself over the last fourteen years. 
Over the years I’ve made my own private jokes. You can really read me. Do you want me to spell it out for you? I’ve certainly given myself a life sentence.
Newly in recovery after a stint in a mental hospital she travels back to her home town to cover the murders of a few young girls in town. But staying with her mother and half-sister is harder then she thought it would be. Thrust back into her old life she must again deal with the death of her younger sister and try to discover who killed two other girls in her home town.This is a dark book full of flawed characters. It shows a very unapologetic side of addictions, self-deprecation and cruelty. Camille’s mother Adora is a special kind of crazy and her half-sister Amma is a chameleon shedding personalities depending on who she is playing the part for. She plays the good little girl acting younger than thirteen for her mother but the town knows her as a promiscuous and conniving teen that controls her friends and enemies with fear, sex and drugs. Both women may drive Camille back to her cutting tendencies if she can’t finish up and escape their torment.As flawed and broken as Camille is, I still really liked her most of the time. I wanted her to find the killer, escape her family, get the big story and win the heart of the cute detective Richard who was working on the case. I teetered with who I thought the killer was and while parts turned out like I expected there were enough surprised to keep me interested in the story. This isn’t a HEA kind of book but I really liked the resolution to the story. It was well thought out and perfect in its own way. With a mystery that is about as much as I can say without giving away the meat of the novel. If you haven’t tried a Gillian Flynn novel this is a good one to cut your teeth on. It isn’t very long and the story progresses quickly enough."
163,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/92664725-rochelle,Rating 3 out of 5,"It usually takes me over four days to read an average-length novel, but I read Sharp Objects in about two days. In my case, that is some speed-of-light level reading. This book is gripping, well-written, suspenseful... Some small parts of it didn't completely meet my expectations, but overall, I did like it.
“It's impossible to compete with the dead. I wished I could stop trying.”
The story opens with a look into the protagonist's (somewhat gloomy) life as a journalist in Chicago. Camille Preaker is unhappy almost all of the time, and her surroundings reflect that. Things get worse for her when her boss, Frank Curry, sends her over to her hometown, Wind Gap, Missouri, to cover the story of two girls: one of them mysteriously abducted and murdered, the other missing with the same fate ahead of her.Sharp Objects is dark. Strikingly so. Despite the fact that the title and synopsis of the book had already hinted at this, it still took me by surprise that some parts of it were so graphic and explicit. It made for quite an interesting atmosphere — one that almost forces the reader to keep reading. Content warnings should be heeded, though: this book is heavy on the self-harm, alcoholism, and drug abuse. Children are also sexualised to an extent.In part, I saw the 'twist' coming. With the amount of hints that are dropped and the suspicious behaviour pointing the reader in certain directions, I think it isn't very hard to figure it out. However, the psychological elements are cleverly dispersed throughout the storyline. That made it worth it to read until the end, despite the predictability.
""I just think some women aren't made to be mothers. And some women aren't made to be daughters.""
The main problem I had with Sharp Objects were the characters. This is a plot-focused book, so I went into it with low expectations on that front, but the portrayal of most of the side characters bugged me from start to finish. Wind Gap is a tiny town full of unhappy people, and I think Flynn wanted to sketch the unpleasantries of it in a very pointed way to bring up comparison points between Camille's current life and her youth, but she illustrated these people as caricatures — they all seem to be actual demons, and copy-and-paste clones of each other. As a result of that, even the more prominent characters like Richard and John appear fake and shallow.Everything else is twisted (in a good way), which I've heard is Flynn's area of expertise. I think she is a very good writer, and I'd definitely pick up another of her books in the future!---------------Additional Notes:- I feel like my thoughts on this book are so incredibly chaotic and two-sided that I couldn't even get myself together well enough to actually write anything well-articulated about it. This review is a rollercoaster"
164,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34715306-jonnie,Rating 5 out of 5,"I came to Gillian Flynn through the critically acclaimed Gone Girl, allowed myself the sweet but mentally discomforting read of Dark Places, before coming face to face with the deeply disturbing Sharp Objects. Each time I read one of Flynn's books, I could essentially feel myself becoming more and more unwell. However, like an addiction, her books just ended up in my hands. Fresh out of a psychiatric ward, Camille, a reporter, returns to her Missouri hometown of Wind Gap to investigate the murders of two preteen girls. Taking up residence in her family's old Victorian mansion with her neurotic, hypochondriac mother, ineffectual wisp of a stepfather and beautiful stepsister with an eerie grip on the town, Camille needs to unravel her own past if she wants to get the story--and survive this homecoming. (I literally just copied this from the books blurb, excuse my lack of creativity at writing a basic synopsis).What sets Sharp Objects apart from it's unhealthy counterparts is its singular perspective which allows you to explore Camille Preaker's thoughts at an uncomfortably deep level - it's like an intense, private narrative: ""I think you're very handsome, too,"" I said, holding his hands so they wouldn't roam. My shirt was thin, I didn't want him to feel my scars. I also cannot stress to you enough how much I love Camille. As majorly fucked up as she is, I applaud Flynn on her existence in the novel. There is something so incredibly vulnerable about her, so needy and craving of motherly affection that at times I almost forgot how old she was. Without sounding like her mother, she was the kind of person that I would want to care for. I think I've said this before, but Flynn's writing is bone-chillingly invasive. After I finished, I felt the need to rid myself of it's nastiness, like grit had become lodged in my brain. Post-read, I guarantee it will proceed to ever so slightly fuck your mind for how ever many nights it takes you to get over it.This book is incredibly unwholesome, however I would still highly recommend it. I wouldn't recommend it to people who like happy endings, or even mildly happy endings. Bittersweet, perhaps? Regardless, you'll probably want to read a really happy book after you finish this. And drink several cups of hot cocoa to sweeten your brain from those dark sticky thoughts that are sure to follow. "

“Sometimes if you let people do things to you, you're really doing it to them.”
Yet again, it's one of those times when you're very well aware of the suspect since the startbut you're fooling around with the characters just so as to get the essence of the whole plot.I'm being biased in terms of my ratings here because it's Gillian Flynn; completelypassing over the fact that the ending was flat out predictable, it was so easily perceivable for me*ugh* but an only question that pondered me all the while was-WHY? Why on earth would that person do that?As for the standards of the first novel, Flynn is impeccably brilliant in terms of everything, JUST EVERYTHING.When I finally turned the last page; heck, it felt sickly, my mind boggled and went stiff because the book is dark and disturbing yet so addictive, twisted and fast-paced.I loved the entire suspense build-up and how the well the characters are contrived.The only fallout apart from the predictability about the ending is that it could have been more dramatic at the end, the pack-up was wrapped up shortly.A MUST read, recommended to all Gillian Flynn fans out there, do NOT miss out on this one."

I mean, I know the book is probably a whole other world, but I already know the plot so I was afraid it would tarnish my enjoyment of the novel. As for this one, I went into it without knowing anything and I must say I wasn't swept off my feet. The pacing felt a little weird, I didn't particularly like the characters (apart from the mom, man she is a piece of work) and in general I didn't feel that much compelled to go back to the story after closing the book. However, the plot twists and ultimately the reveal of whodunnit was one of the best I ever read, and just for this it was worthy to read the whole thing. I mean, isn't this the whole point of reading a thriller? Also, I really want to watch the series."

And also because I was curious to know what all the fuss around Gillian Flynn was about. I guess now I understand. Her writing style is above everything I’ve read so far, with impeccably constructed scenes and characters, not to mention her courage when diving into obscure and disturbing waters, which ended up consuming me as well. The only downside of this book was the quickly wrapped up finale, which could easily be made into a Volume 2 sequel. "

WARNING: This is most definitely an ADULT book. It contains a lot of thematic elements, drugs, alcohol, sexual content, violence, etc. Nothing is unnecessary or overly gruesome, but it is quite detailed and would be considered explicit. S if you are sensitive to any of that stuff, be warned. This book could be a big trigger as well.Characters: Our MC is a thirty-something loner, returning to her hometown in Missouri on assignment for the newspaper she works for. She is investigating and reporting on the disappearance and murders of two young girls in the town. Camille, the narrator, is smart, yet makes some foolish decisions. She is not perfect, but she is aware of her shortcomings. I loved the psychological journey that the reader goes on with her as she is coming to terms with all of these issues. The townspeople are twisted. No one is normal or even slightly resembles a normal person. Her mother and sister are messed up, and all the young people in the town are rebellious troublemakers with a lot of their own issues.Plot: Unlike most murder mystery/psychological thrillers, this book was more than just a plot driven story. Yes, you were interested in the murders and figuring out who did it, but there is much more to it than that. Much of the story is about Camille's own issues and how she faces them upon returning to her hometown. I enjoyed that layer of depth that Gillian Flynn provided on top of SVU/CSI feeling murder aspect of the story. I am not an avid reader of mystery novels, but this one felt quite different than what is expected of the genre. Very original.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with this novel. I agree with a lot of people in saying that it ended quite abruptly, and resolved in a much shorter amount of time than I would have liked. Nevertheless, I enjoyed seeing the answers come together and making connections from throughout the book.Would recommend, IF you are mature enough to handle explicit content. Not for the faint of heart."

I envision her in a huge mansion, with torture devices hanging all around and the severed heads of her neighbors sitting on the table before her. Which, conflicts greatly with her author pic>>  << look at that pic. She looks so freaking nice!Getting back to the book. I've noticed a common thread in GF books, which is that over half of her characters seem to have psychotic qualities. I'm not just talking about main characters. I'm talking about everyone. The mailman fantasizes about fashioning a letter bomb into asshole #6 on his route. The little old lady just might slip poison in her next batch of cookies for the girl scouts. She creates horrific worlds in which everyone is off-kilter, craziness abounds, and the only element of normal in these worlds are abnormal. I LOVE every bit of these stories.This book starts off slower than Gone Girl. I was about 20% in with little interest in the book or characters. Then, things started getting interesting. This book has a great cast of characters, including a fairly unlikable heroine (again, a GF commonality).If you liked Gone Girl or Dark Places - you HAVE to read this. If you haven't read Gone Girl or Dark Places, clear your weekend.Warning: this book contains ZERO romance, sparkly hearts, or fairy dust. It is gritty, suspenseful, and captivating. P.S. Only thing keeping this from 5 stars?? I thought it was great, but AWESOME might be a little strong of a term. Part of that reaction is only because... it's Gillian Flynn.

175,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,Rating 4 out of 5,"I picked up this first novel by Gillian Flynn because I was so blown away by her thriller, ""Gone Girl."" ""Sharp Objects"" tells the story of Camille, a reporter investigating two dead girls in a small Missouri town. Police think the girls may have been the victims of a serial killer. But the book is also the story of Camille's disturbing and dysfunctional family, who live in the town where the murders happened.The story moves along quickly and Flynn has a flair for insights and details. I liked her comment that the more TV a person watches, the more overpolished their quotes are:""Not long ago, I interviewed a woman whose 22-year-old daughter had just been murdered by her boyfriend, and she gave me a line straight from a legal drama I happened to catch the night before: I'd like to say that I pity him, but now I fear I'll never be able to pity again.""""Sharp Objects"" is a good thriller, but it also has the markings of a first novel: traditional plot developments, some on-the-nose dialogue, too many names and not enough description. But that's OK -- a writer has to create a first novel before they can progress to something as amazing as ""Gone Girl."""

I was a new mom, getting up every 2-3 hours with my daughter, and ""Dark Places"" was terrifyingly detailed in what bad things can sometimes happen to small children. I had nightmares because of that book! Fast forward two and a half years. I was curious about ""Sharp Objects,"" and the mixed reviews of the Goodreads community meant that I needed to read it for myself. I have to say, I think this is my favorite of Flynn's books, surpassing ""Gone Girl.""Camille is a reporter with a damaged past. Her family is very dysfunctional, and she coped by cutting words into herself. With the help of her boss, she was able to put the past behind her and start making small strides toward recovery. It's almost ironic that said boss then pushes her right back into her mother's house, and into the small town filled with secrets and death. Two little girls are found murdered, and the police appear ill-equipped to solve the crimes. As Camille untangles the murders, she also becomes closer to her younger half-sister, Amma, someone she only had a fleeting acquaintance with. The relationship between Camille, Amma, and their mother is ... very unhealthy. To complicate matters, there was a sister between Camille and Amma, whose death continues to haunt Camille. Like Flynn's other novels, most of the characters in this book are highly unlikable. There are sociopaths galore here. But I did feel sympathy for Camille, whose past is so damaged that she asks another person if the things she experienced when she was a child were normal or not. Her normalcy compass is that broken.There's a lot of scary commentary here about mothers and daughters, and the intense, sometimes troubling bonds between them. It's definitely a powerful novel. "

But until that point it was mostly boring for me, especially at a time when I asked for a twisty, fast-paced thriller. This one happens to be much more concerned about its characters than the actual murder mystery. I do enjoy books like this and might have appreciated it more if only I was in the right mood for such. So, concentrating was too difficult and I had to switch to the audiobook every time I felt I could no longer go on. Also, there's more tedium, gossips and trigger in the book than I would've entertained.That being said, Gillian Flynn's first novel did impress me a lot. I liked her writing which I think is quite bold and charming as a debut and now I'm very much eager to read her entire catalog. What I admire most about her writing is the deep-seated chilly atmosphere that lingers from beginning to end – that's one of the things I love to see in books all the time. So, kudos for that. There's also some really good bits in the book, but all in all, it just missed the mark for me. I'd still like to watch the characters on screen however and am actually super excited about the series. I've been waiting for ages to watch it! Let's see how that one goes."

Camille is severely flawed and has many issues, but she's written in a way where you want nothing more than for her to find happiness. Her struggles and insecurities are relatable and her unhealthy relationship with her family drives the tension of the plot. Many characters in this book are frustratingly detestable, yet written with such realistic and subtle maliciousness that they bring back memories of the worst types of people I've ever met. Always gotta give an author credit for being able to get under my skin like that.The main crime mystery didn't amount to that much in my opinion and the big plot twist was made very obvious about 30/40% of the way through, but the unsettling interactions between the characters, the familial tension and the subtle wickedness of the antagonists made it a chilling read nonetheless."

Una joven Gillian haciendo sus primeros palotes y mostrando ya ese estilo perturbador que la haría tan famosa. Dice que quería hablar de las mujeres violentas. De las que disfrutan dañando, incluso a los seres más débiles. De las que están lejos de responder a esos instintos protectores y a ese amor puro que se le atribuye a nuestro género. Así que escribió esta espeluznante historia. Oscura. Con algunas partes realmente incómodas y con una temática difícil de asimilar. Hay niños de por medio, hay escenas...extrañas entre miembros de la misma famila y la suceptibilidad de algunos puede ser justificadamente herida.Por mi parte solo puedo decir: Joder, Gillian...y darle cuatro estrellas."
185,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29084789-love-fool,Rating 5 out of 5,If you want to be disturbed for the whole day or week (however long it takes you to read a book) then I recommend this book! I liked the fact that I couldn't figure out how the book will end and in most scenes the book made me cringe or want to drink a large glass of wine to settle my nerves. I think Gillian Flynn has such talent to make you hate a character and for you to be disturbed to the point that you want to stop reading but can't because you need to know how it will end. 
186,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6526961-deacon-tom-f,Rating 5 out of 5,I need to share ahead of time that I am a huge Gillian Flynn fan. This story is the largest collection characters with problems since I read “One Flew Over the Cuckoos nest.”It made for a really exciting mystery because with all the strange characters one could make a case that almost anyone of them could’ve been the murderer.Great read.

188,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49847688-emily,Rating 3 out of 5,"Well, I sped through this in basically a day.Things I likedThe depiction of a toxic mother. I think society (especially American society) tends to sanctify mothers and motherhood. And while LOTS of mothers deserve to be celebrated, often this sanctification comes at the expense of those who must deal with having a mom who is just Not a Good Person. This book plays shows just that, and it shows it well.The mystery itself.  I had FUN trying to figure out where things were going. Knowing Gillian Flynn's general schtick (women can be JUST as fucked up as men, thank you very much) I had some ideas of where the plot was heading. Flynn knows what she's doing and gives you just enough to really appreciate her very well laid twists. The fact that I called some of the most fucked up twists has left me feeling a mix of smug and horrified.The attempt at a modern southern gothic. Some people say you can't write true southern gothic literature anymore, which I personally believe is horseshit. Sharp Objects plays around with the genre staples here, and succeeds more than I anticipated. We get the facade of manners with a seedy underbelly. A ""gentile"" way at life at odds with the larger cultural shifts of the area. We get atmosphere, atmosphere, ATMOSPHERE. Some weird psychosexual stuff. And we get ""grotesques,"" though I feel a bit weird using that word here since Flynn uses self-harm and trichotillomania to do this. While the depictions of these two things never feel explicitly exploitative, I can't personally speak to whether they truly are or aren't.Things I didn't likeThe attempt at a modern southern gothic. Yup, this is one of the book's assets and issues, simultaneously. While I liked a LOT of what Flynn was trying to do here, I also had some problems with how she engaged with the southern gothic as a genre. Firstly, she leans more thriller than southern gothic. The literary snob in me was a bit peeved about this. Secondly, she does not address race or racism AT ALL. Was it Flynn's job to do so, especially considering she's a white woman? Probably not. But I'm annoyed that Flynn dips a toe into examining the ways in which Southern culture presents, as I said earlier, a facade of gentility (particularly in regards to women, female relationships, and female sexuality) in a modern setting without addressing the ways in which that interacts with race. It's an incomplete vision of the modern southern gothic, and it begs the question of whether the book would have been better served--despite the ways in which it succeeds around genre--with just going straightforward thriller.The narrative voice. At times I rolled my eyes at the protagonist, Camille. You know how sometimes, when reading a book from a child/teen's first person perspective, you notice that it was CLEARLY an adult writing? That's what we get with Camille's voice from time to time. While it was generally pretty solid, at times that authenticity floundered and it sounded like Flynn was REALLY trying to sound edgy.This might be the longest three star review I've ever written, so tl;dr: I liked the mystery elements, it's dark AF, and I'm kind of undecided on how I feel about the ways in which Flynn plays around with the southern gothic genre."

Para Frank este reportaje podría ser la bomba que necesita su periódico para poder convertirse de una vez por todas en un gran periódico de referencia de Chicago y lograr credibilidad a nivel nacional, por ende el peso que cae sobre los hombros de Camille es bastante fuerte.Hace ocho años que Camille no pisaba la tierra de Wind Gap, y por ende, que no veía a su madre a su padrastro y hermanastra Amma, volver después de todo este tiempo no es nada de fácil para ella ya que el recuerdo de su hermana muerta la atormenta constantemente.A través de una poderosa narración en primera persona, la autora Gillian Flynn nos hace conocer en profundidad a nuestra protagonista, y de a poco nos va soltando detalles importantes que vivió en el pasado y entender de primera mano toda su vida, sobre todo la importancia y el cambio que hubo en ella luego de la muerte de su hermana.Para Camille ser oriunda de Wind Gap y volver después de ocho años solo a reportear un caso en donde tiene todas las características de ser un asesinato en serie, no es nada de fácil ya que es el típico ""pueblo chico infierno grande"" y todo se sabe a pocas horas que suceda, y a eso sumémosle que la policía no quiere filtrar ningún tipo de detalle de la investigación, por lo cual Camille comienza a hacer sus propias averiguaciones.Los personajes de este libro lo son absolutamente todo, están muy bien perfilados y su descripción psicológica es increíble y a la vez muy espeluznante, la autora crea toda una dinámica muy enfermiza entre ellos, y al estar narrado en primera persona le entrega mayor profundidad a la historia y nos permite conocer a un personaje principal increíble en todo aspecto, Camille tiene grandes problemas psicológicos, es vulnerable, siente culpa y conocer todo eso desde su perspectiva y estar en su mente es muy fuerte.A pesar de que el final es muy predecible, y (¡por primera vez!) logré descifrar quien era el personaje culpable siento que eso no le restó mérito a todo lo increíble que es el camino de la historia, además pasando la mitad del libro el ritmo se vuelve muy vertiginoso, principalmente por las ansias de descubrir quien fue el personaje que hizo todos esos horrores en Wind Gap.En cuanto a la prosa de Gillian es bien atrapante, sucia y a momentos logro perturbarme con su manera de describir las situaciones tan crudamente.Nunca había leído a la autora, pero después de terminar en tiempo récord el audiolibro de Heridas abiertas (y obviamente que veré la serie) sin duda que seguiré leyendo (o escuchando) más de sus historias, ya que me atraparon desde el primer momento y la historia me absorbió a tal punto que no podía leer otra cosa, ya que mi mente estaba en todo momento pensando en esta historia."
196,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24154009-jason,Rating 4 out of 5,"Gooood read. Addicting. I loved the narrator's voice in this novel. Camille has a cool inner voice (the book is first person) - she is flawed as much as any human, but has redeemable qualities as well. She's a former cutter, and she has some psychological problems that have remained from her childhood, but this is all part of what makes her such an interesting character. I liked the suspenseful buildup to the conclusion. I was glued to the pages for the most part. However, the ending was slightly a let down because of how quickly everything wraps up. It's 300 pages of great narration and character development, and then it's all tied of into a neat bow in the last dozen pages, which felt a touch rushed. I also sort of, kind of, knew what the outcome was going to be. But that's all right, because this isn't so much a murder-mystery novel as it is a tale which looks at the inner workings of a rural American family. It's reminiscent of The Husband's Secret, in that both are very well written, both have great character development, but both also have unsurprising and obvious conclusions. It's more about the journey than it is about the outcome. I admit that the reason I picked this book up is because I've seen the movies that have been adapted from Flynn's other two novels. This was the only one where I didn't know anything about the plot. Also Stephen King loved it, so after I read his blurb on his novel I was inclined to buy it. So I did. The whole vibe of the novel is creepiness. All the people in this book are strange, and they almost seem like caricatures of real people. This enhances the experience, because even though you're sure about the final outcome, it creates a thread of doubt in your mind. You find yourself slightly unsure about some of the women and men involved in the story. I liked that Gillian Flynn wasn't scared to discuss from some dark subjects in this book. She observes how families can be toxic on the inside, yet seemingly perfect on the outside. She heavily examines mental illness. She even looks quite a lot at sexuality in adolescents, which some people view as taboo to write about in fiction, as though no adolescent has had a sexual impulse ever. And of course, on the writing, Flynn is skilled. She has a knack for first person narration. Too often, first person can sound like a record on repeat. I, I, I, I, I, I, and so on. This doesn't happen in Sharp Objects. In all, an entertaining read. And I'm sure that the two novels that followed this (Dark Places and Gone Girl) were even better, given that they were longer and had more room with which to work. I look forward to whatever Flynn publishes next, because I'm definitely going to buy it. "

I hate to give 4 stars to this very disturbing and creepy book as that indicates that I ""really liked it"" when the fact is there is nothing to like about this story. I could not however put it down. It is like driving past a terrible accident, you don't want to look but you can't help it! The 4 stars are for Flynn's ability to pull the reader in and hold them squirming until the end. This is the story of a reporter returning to her hometown to investigate/cover the murders of two little girls. The murders are only the tip of the iceberg! Camielle's return to Wind Gap made me feel I had stepped into a scene of The Stepford Wives....no one was what they appeared to be. I kept wanting to yell at her and tell her to get out as fast as she could! But no....she stays and is sucked back into the sickness that is her family, herself and the toxic environment of this small town. Everyone, and I mean almost everyone is harboring secrets....they are a psychiatrist's dream! Old secrets, self image, family dynamics, drugs and alcohol, manipulation etc....and those are the minor themes in this book! Let's not forget murder and mutilation. I read it and thought to myself, who thinks up this horrific stuff?? Gillian Flynn, that's who! I can't imagine how her mind works but she delivers a true horror story to the reader! To share even a bit of this story would almost spoil it. The characters are not likable, or at least don't have many redeeming qualities, except for the 2 men who are not from Wind Gap...Camielles editor and Richard the investigator sent to solve the murders. I felt I needed a shower when I finished this book. (not a bath mind you, for folks who have read this already!) Would I recommend this? I would be afraid to for anyone faint of heart.

Thoughts: Whew. This is easily the most disturbing book I have ever read. It had more trigger warnings than I can list, discussed some of the darkest of topics, and a narrator who while not completely unreliable, was unhinged to put it mildly. I chose this book for my book club pick because of how much I loved Gone Girl and the rave reviews this one has gotten recently. My initial thought when starting this book was that it had a pretty slow beginning, which if you like slow burn, will be appealing. There were quite a few characters and situations that needed to be introduced to the reader prior to diving into the story, so while it did seem quite slow, it was probably necessary. Unfortunately, the disturbing nature of the book is what divided us. My best friend, who is also in my book club, was unable to finish the book due to the content. I on the other hand, was able to and ultimately found the book to be a solid thriller. However, I am unable to rate this book as I cannot properly parse out the quality of the writing from the incredibly disturbing nature. Although Gone Girl had that same intense, dark style that appears to be Gillian Flynn’s niche, it did not feel quite as uncomfortable as this one. If you are someone who likes dark and twisty thrillers that make you uncomfortable, run don’t walk to the nearest bookstore or library to snag this one. And given that I have now read two of her three current releases, Dark Places, which I already snagged as a Book of the Month, will not be far behind. "

It’s relatively short, but it packs quite the punch and the ending is awesome. Camille, a journalist in St Louis, returns home to cover the story of a missing girl in a small town. Soon the circumstances surrounding this crime makes some wonder whether it could be connected to the murder of another girl a year earlier. As Camille dives into the story and becomes close with an out-of-town detective, she is forced to confront some of her own demons. All of the characters in this book (and now the hbo mini series) were well developed. Even the characters you’re meant to dislike, felt real and interesting. I read this book a couple years ago (2015) and I have since read many, many psychological thrillers, and while I wish some of the loose ends were a bit more tied up at the end, I still think this is one of the best plots I’ve read. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a dark and twisty page-turner."

“Sometimes if you let people do things to you, you're really doing it to them.”
I am so disturbed. 
“Safer to be feared than loved.”
This book, although not entirely about this, gives off such a despondent vibe. I feel like all the world's ugliness was characterized in Sharp Objects. It left me kind of empty and conflicted. But not for one second was I able to put the book down. 
“Problems always start long before you really, really see them.”
One piece of advice: have a really light, fluffy, the-characters-shit-rainbows kind of read on hand if you decide to journey into this story. It was so depressing. The monotony described . . . having mediocre life, with mediocre friends, a mediocre job, mediocre parents . . . it takes a toll on the mind. 
“Sometimes I think I won't ever feel safe until I can count my last days on one hand.”
The storyline itself was addicting. I needed to know who killed the girls, why they did it, how they got away with it . . . everything. I was burning with questions. And they way Gillian Flynn portrays the characters, everybody was guilty to me. This whole town was something out of the Twilight Zone. I was thoroughly creeped out by the end of the book. 
“The face you give the world tells the world how to treat you.” 
If you're looking for a story with complex characters that are itching to be dissected, then winner winner chicken dinner. These characters are overflowing in complexity. The more you learn about each person the more you start to think is that the killer? no, them! wait, maybe that other one . . . 
“To spend a life in dreams, that sounded too lovely.”
It took me a little while to really get into Sharp Objects. Everything was so dark and depressing and it sort of left me wanting to give up on this book. But I didn't because I had to know who the killer was. I had ideas, of course. Very, very strong suspicions and even if you guess right, there are so many twisted things to come . . . it almost makes the suspense worse knowing who it is. 
""Camille?"" Her voice quiet and girlish and unsure. ""You know how people sometimes say they have to hurt because if they don't, they're so numb they won't feel anything?""""Mmm.""""What if it's the opposite?"" Amma whispered. ""What if you hurt because it feels so good? Like you have a tingling, like someone left a switch on in your body. And nothing can turn that switch off except hurting? What does that mean?"" 
I am being purposely vague. Reading over my review, I noticed I wrote a whole lot of nothing. I'm sorry for the totally unhelpful review but I think it's better to go in blind. The less you know, the more suspenseful everything will be.  Content Warning:  alcohol, drugs, underage sex, sexual assault, abuse, murder, cutting, and rape.

206,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,Rating 4 out of 5,"I'm finally caught up on Gillian Flynn's books, though I went at them in reverse order. What can I say? I'm a rebel. I've come to expect brutal and ugly awesomeness from Flynn, and she doesn't disappoint with this book, even though it's her first. In some ways, I think that this book is more ugly and cruel and depraved than either Dark Places or Gone Girl. I felt like this book felt more real and personal than either of the other two, and I liked it for that. This is one of those books where you come out the other side with a new, more wary and suspicious outlook. But in other ways, it did feel like a first book to me. I guessed both of the major revelations very early on. It just felt like they were extremely obvious, which is one of the ways this book felt like an early effort. Gone Girl had me guessing my way down a million different theories all the way to the end, but not Sharp Objects. That's not to say it wasn't as good, though. I thought it every bit as good in many ways... just a tad bit predictable in one or two key areas. But, you know, on reflection, maybe that's not such a bad thing. Maybe it's a bit of a nod to the reader, who can see things from an outsider's perspective, so that we can focus on worrying about our narrator who hasn't a clue that she is walking on treacherously thin ice. The writing and pacing and tension are, without a doubt, some of Flynn's strongest areas and I found myself clenched up wondering what would happen. Good stuff. I can't wait for Flynn's next book. "
207,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4695-daniel,Rating 2 out of 5,"Mystery-thriller ""Sharp Objects"" is a perfectly serviceable vacation read -- a page-turner well-suited for a couple sessions by the pool, and then immediately forgetten. Gillian Flynn's novel is the kind of book that gets a glowing blurb from Stephen King, and seems written by a television critic. (King's praise indeed fills the back cover, and Flynn's head TV critic for Entertainment Weekly.)The book's fine for what it is, though a bit sloppily edited, as this type of novel tends to be. With all the people thanked for their help on the acknowledgments page, not one could have helped Flynn decide between “ok” and “okay” -- or, as is usually preferred, though not in this book, “OK” -- if only for consistency's sake? It's not a terrible book. It has a propulsive plot, characters who are not quite three-dimensional but not complete cardboard cutouts either, and writing that is workmanlike but inoffensive. It's just not the type of book I usually read or enjoy. (A book club I'm in picked it.)Some of the reviews that ran when ""Sharp Objects"" was published a few years ago implied it had literary leanings. Don't be fooled. It is a step up from being a completely trashy beach read, but a relatively small step up. ""Sharp Objects"" hardly deserves discussion in a book-club setting, and certainly does not qualify as literature."

Just like in Dark Places, I hated every single character with a passion and the book made me have aggressive thoughts towards them. And yet, I was somehow rooting for the main character and wanted her to figure out the mystery. You can tell that this is the author's debut novel, there are some pacing issues and the ending was rushed. However, this is still a great psychological thriller if you can handle books that are seriously dark.Major trigger warning for depression, abuse and self-harm.Full review to come. "

She is a reporter out there at Daily Post. But now she is sent back to her hometown to write a report on the murders of little girls. It seems like a serial killer is on the loose. Back in town, her old wounds are opening up.Gillian Flynn is one of my favorite authors. Gone Girl still remains my favorite thriller ever. I also enjoyed Dark Places a lot too, gave it 4.5 stars. But this book was such a disappointment. This book is also very much slow paced compared to her other books.Her books are known to be super intense and with very strong unlikable characters. Her unlikable and punchable characters are one of her strongest pursuit in my opinion. When an author can make you hate someone so passionately and makes you punch them hard, that's talent. There were obviously many unlikable characters here as well. But this book... it just rubbed me the wrong way. There were also many scenes that made me feel very uncomfortable. I did not have any problems with her explicitness in her previous books, but this book didn't feel right. And there's just something about 13 year old girls acting like bitches, taking drugs, talking about sex and death. Uh no. No. No. Seriously, what the hell was wrong with all the women in this town?Also, this book is so boring. Nothing happens at all. Two little girls are murdered brutally and looks like a serial killer is on the loose, but not much is focused on the investigation. Majority of this book is centered around Camille and her relationship with her mother and her half sister, Amma. It was fine in the beginning when she came back to her hometown and we got to see her family and was intrigued why she left her hometown but I wasn't expecting the entire book would be centered around that. I mean, now that I have read the book I think it makes sense. But while reading it I was so damn bored and I wanted the focus to be on the murders of the girls.The only good thing about this book was the plot twist in the end. That's why I am giving it one star more, otherwise it'd have been a 2 stars book. But did the ending made the book worthwhile? No.Overall it was a very disappointing read and I don't see myself recommending this book. If you want to read Gillian Flynn (and you should), I'd highly highly recommend Gone Girl or Dark Places.(TW: self harm, cutting)"

Among the things that I have heard about her though was also the fact that her books were very violent. And this book really is. It is shocking, it is violent, it is dark but it is also amazingly clever. It kept me awake till the late hours. Flynn is one of the most ingenious authors I have ever read. She unfolds her clever plot and she develops her characters by a way so that you think you know the truth but you just don't. For over the half of the book I was pretty sure that I knew who the murderer was. Well, I was wrong. The last few pages blew me away. She just managed to twist her plot in a way so unpredictable that it left me breathless. What adds to her clever plot is the well developed characters. For the biggest part these characters are strong, independent women. Something rare in the crime literature where usually women are the victims and men the abusers.I do not read a lot crime/ mystery novels but after this book I will definately look out for more. So even if this kind of books are not usually your cup of tea, you should give this book a try. Personally, I will definitely read more novels by Gillian Flynn."

I never include trigger warnings, but I will for Sharp Objects: readers who are triggered--especially by cutting--but also by a plot involving child jeopardy or extremely toxic family relationships, may want to look for a different novel. Readers who like to consciously or subconsciously identify with the protagonist as they read may find it challenging to do so in Sharp Objects. A small point that doesn't affect the writing, but is typical of many books--the character who owns the major business is never shown running it. ""Absentee owner""/""rent-collector"" is too much of a dodge. Better to just have let her be rich because she sold the business. We're back to Professor Deidre McCloskey's point about the unflattering portrayals of work in most media, including Shakespeare, since...forever. http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/b...Readers who like recovery memoirs, who like dialogue brimming with brutally honest feeling, or who like Midwestern gothic/horror will want to pick up this very original book.Sharp Objects passes the Bechdel test with flying colors. https://www.macmillandictionary.com/d..."

Camille Preaker is a journalist in Chicago who gets sent to investigate the murder/missing girl in small town Wind Gap, where Camille grew up. We find out a lot of dark things about the main character and her past: she's a cutter, alcoholic, experienced sexual trauma, grief. You also see the strained, unhealthy relationship with her mother. She pushes through all of the emotional pain to help find the killer, and leave Wind Gap behind.The MC is such a broken person. She's dark and depressed, and I totally wasn't expecting that. Her emotional trauma goes so deep, you can't help but to feel sympathy for her. I kind of predicted the murder mystery part about half way into the book. What kept me going was the MC and seeing how this will all end for her.I watched the HBO series in tandem with reading this, and I think the show did a great job. I'm not always a fan of screen adaptations, but this one was done well.This book ended up more of a sad, dark story than a suspense/murder mystery story and I don't hate it."

There are some seriously disturbing scenes described in this book, but the plot line as well as the narration are so masterly that every action is justified... The pain and suffering of the characters is omnipresent and controls their thoughts, their behavior, their whole existence. I felt so sorry for Camille...

As soon as just one main character is unbelievable, the book loses credence. And I can't believe I'm saying this (because usually ""dark"" books don't bother me), but this one seems a little too dark and twisted for me. I didn't want to spend time with the sickos. "

I don't think there was a single character in this novel that I liked. They were all ridiculously immature. I had to keep reminding myself that Camille was in her 30s and not high school age. Richard, the lead investigator, was equally as bad. The way their relationship/fling ended left a bitter taste in my mouth. He should've been able to handle having a conversation with Camille about her scars, instead he just looked at her disgusted. I enjoyed how fast-paced this was. I will probably check out the TV series. "

224,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,Rating 3 out of 5,"Today's writers apparently believe they need to give their story's characters bizarre personalities in order to keep their books from being just another murder mystery. Gillian Flynn has tested the limits of this trend by writing 
Sharp Objects
 through the first person narrative of a newspaper reporter named Camille Preaker who has numerous mental health issues, the most dramatic of which is a compulsion to self mutilate. She has received counseling and treatment in a mental hospital for the problem. It's now mostly under control, but the compulsive urges continue. And as the story progresses we learn that she is one of the more saner women in the story. There are no good women in this story. They're all twisted in some way. Even the teenaged and younger girls are mentally unbalanced. By comparison the men in the story are relatively well adjusted. There are probably dozens of mental health diseases portrayed in this book, some of which are more bizarre than self mutilation. But I can't say any more without being a spoiler. I can't help but wonder what the opinions of mental health professionals are of this book. I generally don't enjoy reading about people behaving badly. But this ends up being an interesting story. And once I got used to it, hearing the inner thoughts of a person struggling with obsessive thoughts and compulsive urges was also somewhat insightful. But warning to the reader; A lot of the story's scenes and the inner thoughts of the narrator have to do with blood and gore.The story's protagonist, Camille Preaker, is a cub reporter in Chicago and is sent back to her Missouri hometown to investigate the grisly murders of two young girls. She is also a woman with sad secrets of her own, and the scars of many self-inflicted childhood cuts to prove it. This tension-building, stylish, dark thriller shows that you can go home again, but you probably shouldn’t.I selected this book because of it's rural Missouri setting which is my part of the country (except I'm from Kansas). Also the author, Gillian Flynn, grew up in the Kansas City area and attended KU which are things I can identify with. Had I known that the story's protagonist was so mentally twisted I probably would have never listened to the book. But it turned out to be a good, but dark, mystery story. There is an essay by Gillian Flynn at http://www.powells.com/essays/flynn.html in which she said that she wanted to write about the violence of women. She said there are already plenty of books about ""brutal men, trapped in a cycle of aggression."" So she set out the balance things out, and she succeeded.The following quote from the book I think summarizes the book's message:""Sometimes I think illness sits inside every woman, waiting for the right moment to bloom. I have known so many sick women all my life. Women with chronic pain, with ever-gestating diseases. Women with conditions. Men, sure, they have bone snaps, they have backaches, they have a surgery or two, yank out a tonsil, insert a shiny plastic hip. Women get consumed."""

Wie heißt die Nebenstraße?, fragte er, und als ich nicht antwortete, drehte er sich zu mir und fragte: Ist hier jemand?Ich bin hier, sagte ich, und die Worte klangen unerhört tröstlich. Wenn ich in Panik gerate, spreche ich sie laut vor mich hin. Ich bin hier. Meist fühle ich mich nämlich anders. Als könnte mich ein warmter Windstoß für immer wegwehen, ohne dass auch nur der Halbmond eines Fingernagels von mir bleibt. Manchmal ist die Vorstellung beruhigend, dann wieder fröstele ich bei diesem Gedanken.""Camille, die ihre Jugend alles andere als unbeschadet überstanden hat, wird als Reporterin in ihre Geburtsstadt Wind Gap entsandt, um über die Morde an zwei kleinen Mädchen zu berichten. Auch wenn der väterliche Freund und Herausgeber der Zeitung Camille mit den besten Absichten ins südliche Missouri schickt, hat die Begegnung mit Familie und Heimat nichts Heilsames und Camille findet sich bald in einem alptraumhaften Sog gefangen, der nicht nur alte Wunden aufreißt.Es fällt nicht leicht, CRY BABY in eine Schublade zu stecken und einen Gefallen tut man diesem Roman damit ganz gewiss nicht. Zwei tote Mädchen und die Suche nach ihrem Mörder legen nahe, dass es sich um einen Krimi handelt, und da Gillian Flynn einen Schwerpunkt auf die Beschreibung seelischer Zustände legt (und nicht auf Behauptungen), wäre CRY BABY folglich ein Psychothriller. In einem unkonventionelleren Sinne ist CRY BABY aber ein Horror-Roman im Sinne Shirley Jacksons, in dem eine vom Leben gebeutelte Erzählerin mit ganz realen Alpträumen konfrontiert wird, die gegen den Strich gebürstet als Familie und Zuhause figuriere. Sicherlich kann man sich vorstellen, dass dieses Begriffspaar kein Synonym für Geborgenheit sein muss, aber wie traumatisch=schmerzhaft für Camille das Gegenteil der Fall ist, das beschreibt Gillian Flynn mit einer Sprache, die pointiert knapp und auf den Punkt erzählt, jenseits aller Klischees. Und so überraschend, wie ihre Imagination und ihre genaue Beobachtungsgabe arbeiten, so überrascht auch CRY BABY und bleibt bis zum Ende spannend.GONE GIRL war für mich der herausragende Thriller des Jahres 2012, und als der Scherz Verlag den Romanerstling von Gillian Flynn in der 2. Auflage in gleicher Aufmachung nachschob, hatte ich Bedenken, ob CRY BABY meinen Erwartungen gerecht werden würde. Gillian Flynn hat mich nicht enttäuscht, CRY BABY ist unglaublich gut erzählt, ein düster=heftiges Exemplar einer Southern Gothic Novel, die mich auch auf der sprachlichen Ebene vollkommen überzeugt hat. Frei von allem Geschwafel und Banalitäten beschreibt Gillian Flynn vor allem die äußeren Geschehnisse und überlässt es dem Leser, Rückschlüsse auf Motive und Befindlichkeiten der Charaktere zu ziehen. Und während sich vieles erschließt, bleibt anderes doch geheimnisvoll und macht gerade so den enormen Reiz aus, den der Roman für mich hatte."

I'm going to need time to process this.I honestly have no freaking idea how the hell to start talking about this book. I don’t know. It left me spent and bewildered and with a giant “what the fuck” running around in my head. It was disturbing, amazing, well written and…just wow. That’s the only word I can think of that can completely encompass this book: WOW.Sharp Objects follows the story of Camille, a reporter from Chicago, who returns to her hometown of Wind Gap, Missouri, to cover the disappearance and murder of two girls, age 9 and 10, who are believed to be the victims of a serial killer. But Camille needs to confront her own demons, which have driven her to self harm from a young age, and her family, especially her relationship with her mother and the death of her sister.This is not a book for the faint of heart. It deals with mature subjects, ranging from self harm, depression, murder, eating disorders, mental illness, drug and alcohol abuse. You’ll constantly be asking yourself: “what the hell is wrong with these people”. At least I did. I had constant disbelief on my face. It’s a great piece of writing regarding the psychology of small communities. How they work, how they think, how fake and forced they are most of the times. How they judge and scrutinize every little thing and how appearances are pretty much all that matters most of the times. The characters are fucked up in more ways that I can possibly describe. I know this is not very…um…review-ish, but it’s the best description I can come up with. The adults, the kids, everyone is fifty shades of fucked up (haha, see what I did there?). It’s a nice change, for me at least, to read about characters like this. It’s a challenge, because they’re not characters I can relate to as much, but the writing is so good, that you can’t help but get attached. And care. And devour the pages, in order to find out what’s happening.It’s a very plot driven book, but it focuses on character development as well. The writing is powerful, gripping and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. It’s haunting, unforgettable, disturbing and it will have you in a book hangover the moment you put it down. It’s raw, dirty even, and there’s no way you’re left with a pleasant feeling when you’re done. It’s just impossible. But it’s worth it. Trust me. Favourite quotes:“Problems always start long before you really, really see them.” “This is the unforgiving light of the morning, time to drop the illusion.” ★★★★★To everyone who got this far, thank you for reading and have a wonderful day! Also, feel free to share your thoughts, comment or tell me anything :)"
227,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26262267-lindsey-dahling,Rating 4 out of 5,"My favorite thing about Gillian Flynn is her vividly direct writing style. I find that she writes with the perfect amount of details for the genre and setting—meaning, she doesn't ""overdo"" it. I never once sit there and roll my eyes through a bunch of flowery language describing the wind blowing or shout, ""YEAH. I GET IT, GILLIAN"" because she's beating two dead horses known as metaphors and symbolism. Basically, she’s a great writer and isn’t a douche about it. I'm a fan.And, since this is a Gillian Flynn book, I knew I was getting myself into a jumble of fucked up AND I WAS HERE FOR IT.GURL. Just like with Gone Girl, I found most of the character to be despicably awesome--something I love (Cersei Lannister is my homegirl). There are character flaws galore and everyone is shady AF because of it. The only reason the ending wasn't a surprise to me was because someone ruined it for me last year (I'll never be over this, tbh). Did I like it as much as Gone Girl? No. But I still really fucking liked it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was due to the rushed reveal at the end. Not a fan. I also don't need tied-up-in-a-pretty-red-bow resolutions, which could be why I prefer Gone Girl. Regardless, if you enjoy VC Andrews, Gillian Flynn, 90s Lifetime movies full of disturbing crimes, THEN GURL YOU BETTER READ THIS.Non-spoilery trigger warnings I wish I would've known before going into this:1. Self-harm--specifically trichotillomania. I saw all of the TWs on other reviews and assumed it just meant cutting (which was correct), but trich is in there, too. Beware of that, trich friends. I didn't skip any descriptions of it, so it's not too terribly bad, but I did rush through a couple of those parts. Flynn treats it seriously, so it's tolerable (for me, anyway).2. Animal lovers will need to skip a lot of scenes. The main character's family owns a pig slaughterhouse. No further detail necessary here. Just start skipping sentences/paragraphs whenever pigs are mentioned. I'm sure (hopeful?) the descriptions of...all of this...was significant, but I didn't read any of it and still managed to thoroughly understand and enjoy the book."
228,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75183808-kathryn-in-fl,Rating 4 out of 5,"MYSTERY, SUSPENSE, FAMILY DRAMA, MURDER and HORRORSo, Gillian Flynn can write...we all know that by now. Her tales are twisty and full of hidden darkness. They take a close look at those closest to us, who beg to be revealed and at the same time, it are just to scary to look at. How do you love someone, who is so evil? Each story including this one delivers way more graphic details and gory (and horror) than I bargained for and frankly, this will be my last. You see, it is to much like the horror I experienced growing up and while most find this a fascinating dive into such a dark world entertaining and that which they can put on the shelf when they are done, not me. I already knew where the plot was going very early before the big hint was delivered because I walked that troubling road. Flynn is an expert at leaving you bread crumbs to find your way down a road you just can't help but return very different in thought and perspective. Frankly, she is just way to good. Begging the question that jabs at me as I experience her stories, how real is this to her? For it is far to real and was far to real for me.I listened to the audio version, which I believe added greatly to the experience if that is important to you, then skip the read and go for immersion.Warning this book has graphic descriptions of animal cruelty, human cruelty, torture, self-harm and sexual acts. Those persons that are particularly empathetic should abstain."
229,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/95415507-timothy-hickson,Rating 5 out of 5,"Very few stories have their characters leaping from the page in the way 'Sharp Objects' does. I don't think I have hated a character quite as much as the mother here since Ramsey Bolton. Flynn's ability to take even the tiniest character, with just a few lines, and make them as real and visceral as some characters who spend hundreds of pages with in other books, astounded me. Many dark mysteries fall flat because the main character's journey is distant from the emotional and thematic elements of the mystery. There's brutality, but the author expects us to care simply because of the brutality. The reason 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' succeeded was because it managed to take one such mystery and place it at the feet of someone—Salander—whose personal journey gives it depth and power. 'Sharp Objects' does this in a way that absolutely floored me. The odd thing is that for a mystery book, it is rather lite on investigating. Clues are discovered, but large swathes of the book are spent developing an equally puzzling dynamic between our protagonist and her (largely) estranged family. Normally, I would expect this to put me off a mystery. I want to uncover the truth! But it didn't. In fact, it drew me deeper than I could ever have guessed. If you enjoy darker mysteries with emotionally complicated themes like 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' or Stephen King, then pick this up.I will be purchasing all of Flynn's books, I should think."

Now I know.This is a truly unique book. Not only because of the plot, but also because of the main character and the whole atmosphere of the story. And at the same time, this book made me uncomfortable many times. But that's what I think is its advantage, even if it wasn't a pleasant feeling. Although there were times when it made me feel reluctant to continue reading. My discomfort resulted mainly from the actions of the main character and the choices she made. Camille is the kind of person I have had the urge to shake quite often while yelling at her to act like an adult. But I understand why she makes these choices. I believe that she is a perfectly constructed person from the point of view of character psychology.The plot was also fascinating. On the surface, it's a typical story. Two girls are brutally murdered in a small town and everything points to a serial killer. Camille, the main character, returns after many years to the town where she grew up to describe these crimes. It sounds like a typical story you've read many times before. But what the author has done with this simple idea is truly unique. A small town turns out to be saturated with dark secrets and small crimes. Everyone knows their place in the ranks, and any deviations will not be tolerated. Bored rich ladies raise their little ideal children who continue the family tradition of maintaining a strict hierarchy. All these secrets and dependencies are really fascinating.We see all this through the eyes of the main character, Camille, who, as the daughter of one of the most important women in the town, is a part of this society and, due to her profession as a reporter and an escape from the town many years ago, is beyond it. At the same time, Camille has her own problems related to both alcohol abuse and deep mental problems. Her problems sometimes prevent her from discovering the truth, but amazingly, sometimes they help her put things into perspective.This is a truly unique book. I had tried reading Gone Girl by this author before and found it boring. It was completely different with this one."

240,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9323164-trina,Rating 2 out of 5,"2.5 stars.I just don't enjoy miserable, wretched stories about miserable, wretched people living miserable, wretched lives in miserable, wretched towns.If you want to read something dark and seedy, this is the book for you. If you want to read a truly shocking mystery... well this probably isn't that book.Pro:The writing was very easy to read. I could fly through many pages at a time and didn't want to put it down. So that's good I guess.Con:The writing was VERY simple. This was Flynn's debut so I'm willing to cut it some slack. Writing is never the determining factor of if I enjoy a story or not. But it was very, very straightforward, lacking any flourish or character. I found a lot of things to be quite cliche and many of the characters felt like cardboard cut outs of characters that were ""supposed"" to be included in a mystery but had no real characterization or purpose.Pro:There was a bonus little twist thrown in at the very end which did catch me off guard because I felt the ending was going to be SO. DARN. OBVIOUS.Con:This extra twist was also SO. DARN. OBVIOUS. Con: (I'm out of pros already):The whole mystery was just way too convenient.Con:The romantic relationships.There was a love triangle. And BOTH of them were instalove.And neither of these relationships did anything to advance the story. Neither of them even affected the main character, so whyyyyyyy.CON:Every dark and ugly theme you can imagine was thrown in here. Most without a real purpose.There are 2 main trigger warnings I think need to be mentioned.1. There is self harm. The main character is a cutter. Her desires to cut were described in such a pleasurable and justified way that it made me very uncomfortable. I felt a lot of sympathy for her and what she had been through, but overall this didn't seem to add to her characterization very much? Aside from the fact that we know she had a rough home life and didn't want people to see her skin... what purpose did this truly serve? It felt kind of dropped after all that time we spent learning about it.2. 13 year old characters are sexualized. Look, movies can't show underage nudity, so I really don't understand why books can. Sex acts with 8th graders are described, body parts are described in detail (and not as part of an attack, or having anything to do with the murders, just descriptions of bored kids doing mature things). It was more uncomfortable to read about these things than to read about the brutal murders of children that the plot revolved around. And again, many of these descriptions could have been left out without changing how seedy the story was. Why was this included? Just another layer of darkness and shock. Overall, I don't have to like the characters in a book to enjoy the book. But I do have to have a bit more depth and thrill to a mystery. I think this was a pretty well thought out story, but it got sidetracked with showing seedy small town life and unnecessary romantic entanglements. I read this with a friend and one thing she pointed out was that Sharp Objects had a more fulfilling ending than Gone Girl. And that's true. The mystery was wrapped up, this book did what it set out to do. I just personally didn't enjoy much about it. There are plenty of other mysteries out there that have more enjoyable and thrilling plots in my opinion. This one didn't really distinguish itself from the pack of adult mysteries out there, except for piling on the darkness."

Enferma  es la mejor palabra que puede describir esta lectura, este segundo libro de la autora es  retorcido, enfermo, duro, escalofriante  y tan pero tan horrible que no puedes mantenerte indiferente mientras lees.No se si es por lo poco acostumbrada que estoy a leer este tipo de historias o si es simplemente porque la autora tiene un don a la hora de escribir historias como esta, pero pase gran parte de la lectura asqueada por lo lejos y bajo que puede llegar el ser humano.Es un libro que empieza un poco lento y que te va dando la informacion "" a cuenta gotas "" , quizas por eso sea una lectura tan atrapante, sabes que los hechos que ocurren son horribles e inmorales pero no puedes parar de leer.Ni en un millon de años hubiera esperado que esta historia superara a Perdida en lo retorcido pero debo decir que esta lectura me parecio aun mas cruel y oscura que el libro de Nick y Amy.La protagonista, Camille me provoco sentimientos contradictorios, en algunos momentos senti cierta empatia hacia ella, sobre todo por todo lo que sufrio de niña pero tambien huiberon momentos en los que llegue a odiarla. Me alegro mucho de que Camille y Richard no acabaran juntos, durante toda la lectura no podia parar de pensar que si en un final remoto terminaran juntos, ella terminaria corrompiendolo, y el personaje de Richard era demasiado bueno, creo que el es la forma de al autora de decir que no todos los seres humanos puedes convertirse en seres horribles como Amma o Adora, hay algunos que no se arruinan por el camino. Hay una frase que creo que explica a la maravilla lo que hubiera sido el futuro de esta pareja si hubieran seguido juntos : "" Alguien una vez me dijo que tuviera cuidado con las personas rotas, pueden cortarte con sus pedazos. "" Ademas me gusta pensar que el detective encontro a una buena chica y tuvo una vida muy feliz xDD * sonrojo * Heridas Abiertas no es una lectura que recomiende a todo el mundo, creo que quien se arriesgue a leer este libro necesita ser lo suficiente madur@ para entender ciertas partes y tambien tener la mente abierta porque si soy totalmente sincera fue un libro que me dejo  sucia  a falta de una palabra mejor, tuve la sensacion de que al leer una historia como esta, "" perdi "" parte de mi misma.Sí, se que hay gente malvada en el mundo pero de ahi a verlo reflejado tan claramente como en Heridas Abiertas es un gran paso.3.75 Estrellas!"

A town so suffocating and small, you tripped over people you hated every day. People who knew things about you. It's the kind of place that leaves a mark.I read this book as I've recently started the TV series and loved it. It's a 3.5 for me - damn you Goodreads and your non-ten-star rating! - and I'm just FULL of mixed feelings about this one.On the one hand, Gillian Flynn can really write - her sentences conjure hazy middle American scenes, tinged by secrets and darkness. Her characters are realistic in their flaws and their strengths, and her mysteries are delightfully twisted. But......on the other hand, it took me two weeks to read this book, and not because I'm a slow reader, but because I was so determined not to DNF. There's something distasteful about almost every one of the characters, and as with Gone Girl, I found it a slog to get through all the darkness in her people and places. It's grim, and it revels in it's grimness, while I prefer my grim/dark/gritty tragedy overlaid by a layer of hope or humanity.This is one of those reviews where I had to write it personally, because this is a book that's objectively good - it's just not going to work for every reader."

I had been putting off reading Sharp Objects because I didn't want to not have anything else by Gillian Flynn to read. Lord this book is a doozy! I'm giving it 4 stars eventhough I kinda want to give it 1 star and 5 stars. I truly don't know if I hate this book or love it and that's the beauty of Gillian Flynn's writing. Sharp Objects is a short book but it's also a slow burn. Ms. Flynn takes her time unraveling the many dark layers of this story. It was a wild ride, if I hadn't been buddy reading it with my friend Kelsea I would have read it in one sitting. As with all Gillian Flynn novels Sharp Objects was an compulsive read that hooked me from page 1. My brain hurts but I would definitely recommend this book to my fellow Thriller lovers. "

Everything about this story and especially its characters screams wrong and twisted and sick and fucked up. This book weighs on you with the mere suggestion that this is even a possibility, that people like this and stories like this could exist somewhere in the world, quietly unfolding in all their disturbing glory.You can attribute it to my peaceful and quiet upbringing or some inherent naivete that I haven't gotten rid of yet but honestly, it is absolutely beyond me how anyone could even start to imagine people like the characters in this book. Where would you even start?Either way, this book is a masterpiece of psychological horror that gnaws at you and sends chills down your back and genuinely makes you horrified at the human race. Very recommendable but only if you're currently in the market for some very strong emotions."

Not in detail, but general things like plots, endings, and main characters.Not with this book though. Usually it takes me about a couple of pages into the book to remember the plot and then everything else comes back to me gradually in bits and pieces, but with this book, I had to get to over 40% before I could vaguely recall the main character and the ending... but not much else. This reread was like reading for the first time.It's not that this book is forgettable. More like the premise has been done too many times before in contemporary mysteries. You have a troubled main character with a turbulent life who returns to her hometown and stumbles upon a mystery that's very close to her heart. It's strange but also familiar to her, and to no one's surprise, it has connections to her trouble past. So she takes it upon herself to investigate this case--she's a journalist, by the way--and chases down every twisted lead. And each lead is a major trigger for her that brings up all sorts of darkness from the past. After a series of close-calls and heart-pounding, page-turning chapters, she solves the case, although not well and gets very little closure at the end.The one thing that sets this book apart from others like it is the voice. It's told in Gillian Flynn's particular style, like 
Gone Girl
 but better and more nuanced imo. The writing more disorganized and less theatrical. More unpredictable and more organic, less tightly controlled. It delves deep into the frayed psyche of a life-long cutter who has never really had a chance to work through any of her problems. There were many moments in which I wished I could have looked away, but couldn't because Flynn had me on the edge of my seat.Flynn has a way of getting under a character's skin (and my skin), and she projects her voice poignantly on a variety of issues. I don't necessarily like her characters or even enjoy the stories she's telling--although ""enjoy"" is not the right word here, feels too tacky--but I'm always interested in what she has to say and how she says it.“It's impossible to compete with the dead. I wished I could stop trying.”[...]“I just think some women aren't made to be mothers. And some women aren't made to be daughters.”[...]“Safer to be feared than loved.”[...]“I ached once, hard, like a period typed at the end of a sentence.”A word of warning though. Cutting and self-harm are featured heavily in this book, in excruciating detail.* * * * *Rereading because I honestly don't remember having read this book.

Parecem não haver limites no quão retorcido alguém consegue ser para prejudicar, magoar, até mesmo matar alguém. Com os livros lidos na ordem inversa da sua publicação original, não será descabido dizer que gostava de ver a autora a voltar ao registo deste mesmo livro. Objetos Cortantes foi a sua primeira obra, sempre narrada na primeira pessoa por uma única protagonista, e saiu-se muito bem. Em 

Lugares Escuros

 e 


Em Parte Incerta


 assistimos a algo mais compassado, sempre alternando entre protagonistas e espaços temporais, mas neste seu romance de estreia a linha de acção é continua, sempre com Camille na liderança da acção, não prejudicando o mistério que se quer fazer sentir num livro destes. São crescendos, tanto a curiosidade como o horror que vamos sentido com o evoluir da história. Não é tanto a forma como as raparigas aparecem mortas, asfixiadas e sem dentes, mas antes o que as suas mortes podes implicar na vida de Camille. E à medida que vamos conhecendo os seus medos, o seu passado, somos confrontados com uma relação completamente disfuncional entre mãe e filha que acaba por ter repercussões tenebrosas e irreversíveis. Gillian Flynn é mestre em explorar obsessões doentias em relações passionais e Objetos Cortantes é afiado e acutilante em vários sentidos. Existe um repúdio constante em relação às várias personalidades que vamos conhecendo. Ninguém escapa à morbidez das suas próprias acções, ao ordinário que é ceder às carências, mesmo quando estas envolvem masoquismo extremo. No fundo, acompanhamos três gerações de mulheres danificadas. Camille, a sua mãe e ainda a sua meia-irmã, Amma, que aos treze anos já se droga e tem relações sexuais como gente grande. A narrativa evolui sempre com este trio como pano de fundo. A investigação avança, existe um ou outro suspeito, mas sabemos desde o início que algo de muito errado se passa com as Preaker. As pistas vão sendo deixadas por amizades antigas, por comentários vingativos, mas principalmente por um abrir de olhos de Camille. O truque desta obra é, sem dúvida, a escrita e a intensidade e a imagética que são passadas ao leitor. Não são raras as passagens em que o estômago se contorce, em que todos os cenários se tornam tão vividos que parece que somos transportados para lá, que nem voyeurs que não têm bem a certeza se querem estar mesmo a assistir ao que estão a testemunhar. O fim não foi uma surpresa, mas também não acho que isso influencie a opinião desta leitura. Todos os livros têm um fim, mas no caso de Objetos Cortantes este apenas acaba por juntar peças que já se namoravam. É uma obra arrepiante, com níveis de dissociação cruéis, mas que também sabemos ser reais em casos não assim tão raros. É disto que gosto na escrita de Flynn, a capacidade de por à prova o leitor espetando-lhe as mais duras e frias realidades. "
255,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19061124-laura-mystery-in-minutes,Rating 5 out of 5,"Visit https://www.mysteryinminutes.com/revi... to read (and watch) the complete Mystery in Minutes review!Sharp Objects is the multi-award winning and nominated, 2006 debut by Gillian Flynn, the American author of a little book that you may have heard of, called ""Gone Girl"". So why is Mystery in Minutes reviewing this in 2018, you might ask? First, because Sharp Objects was the only full length novel of Ms. Flynn's that I had not yet read, and second, because the crime fiction world is all atwitter about the highly anticipated, July 8th premiere of HBO's Sharp Objects mini-series, starring Amy Adams as Camille Preaker, and Patricia Clarkson as her mother, Adora.Sharp Objects is the story of a Chicago newspaper journalist who returns to her hometown of Wind Gap, in ""the boot heel"" of Missouri, to report on the disappearance of a young girl, less than a year after another preteen girl from the community was found, murdered. I have always thought of Missouri as a mid-western part of the US, but Sharp Objects has a Southern Gothic feel to it (Wind Gap is ""spitting distance from Tennessee and Arkansas""), and, with the exception of very brief references to a computer screen and to cell phones, the book has a late 1950s, early 1960s vibe. Gillian Flynn is an imaginative, singular wordsmith, and while Sharp Objects is not overly violent, her descriptive style in this macabre and raw character study may be too unrelentingly dark and unsavory for those readers with more ""delicate sensibilities"". Sharp Objects is not a ""thriller"" in the truest sense of the word; it is not a novel that you read for heart-pounding action. Ms. Flynn's deliberate pacing might best be described as a ""slow cut"". At first, the reader experiences just a surface pressure, as we are introduced to the town of Wind Gap, and to some of the characters of the book. Then that pressure begins to slowly intensify and prick at the reader as Camille progresses with her journalistic investigation, until, finally, there is a full-on, deep-dive into Camille's psyche, and her relationship with others, most notably with her mother and her half-sister. This story worms its way under your skin, like a splinter, and with clever misdirection, the reader's need to know which outsider or member of the townsfolk committed these crimes becomes an addictive, page-turning compulsion!While I have enjoyed all of Ms. Flynn's novels, Sharp Objects is my favorite. If done well, the screen adaptation could be amazing. For readers who relish not only the mystery of solving a crime, but also the examination of psychologically-disturbed characters, Sharp Objects is not to be missed. Wicked, nasty, stunning."
256,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair,Rating 3 out of 5,"I'd had Gillian Flynn's first novel 'saved up' for a while, finally deciding to read it now because I wanted something I wouldn't need to review at length in the midst of a huge backlog. Sharp Objects is just as compelling as Flynn's other books, but it will leave you feeling - to employ a word I'd never normally use, but nothing else fits - grubby. From protagonist Camille Preaker's prolific cutting, to girls of barely thirteen behaving in ways that would be shocking in women twice their age, and the stomach-jolting, queasy intimacy of the Preaker family, it's a horrible story told in a way that gets under your skin. The plot involves Camille, a Chicago-based journalist, returning to her hometown to cover a story about two young girls found dead and toothless; ostensibly the work of a serial child-killer. She finds the town, Wind Gap, locked in a kind of time warp, schoolfriends trapped in adult versions of their high-school roles, her teenage half-sister Amma an unsettling facsimile of herself at the same age. Most disturbing is Camille's clinging, cloying mother Adora, a nightmarish figure who blends the worst aspects of overzealous 'nurturing' and harmful indifference. As ever, Flynn is adept at drawing out the bleakness, the desperation, the sheer dirtiness of small-town life, but the result is so effective that you might feel an urgent need to get the book over and done with and get the hell out of Wind Gap, just like everyone keeps urging Camille to. It's also highly probable that you'll (sort of) guess the culprit way before Camille figures it out - and certain events near the end seem extraneous - but, as with 
Dark Places
, the reveal is secondary to the build-up. I can't say I 'enjoyed' Sharp Objects - it's way too grim and grimy and sickening. But Flynn's writing is never anything less than absorbing, and she is wonderful at creating characters (I loved Camille) and a sense of place. "

«Una niña criada con veneno cree que el dolor es un consuelo.»

 Terminé este libro exactamente a las 01:35 de la madrugada. No quise acostarme sin haberlo terminado primero, así que sacrifiqué mis preciadas horas de sueño por Sharp Objects. No logré conciliar el sueño después de acabarlo. Lo intenté. Le ordené a mis párpados que se cerraran, le ordené a mi cuerpo que entrara en un profundo suelo. Pero no logré dormir. Simplemente porque estaba aterrada por lo que había leído. Aterrada. Estaba muriendo de miedo creyendo que Amma saldría de las sombras de mi habitación y me arrancaría los dientes. Seguía mirando hacia la oscuridad, temblando por cada pequeño ruido que escuchaba. Así que me arropé con todas las sábanas y cobijas que tenía, me refugié en mis almohadas y cerré los ojos con fuerza, rogando para no tener pesadillas. Tanto me afectó este libro que ahora tengo unas horribles ojeras por no poder pegar un ojo en toda la noche. Con Sharp Objects, Gillian Flynn entra a mi lista de autores favoritas, no sólo porque sus historias son macabras y perturbadores, sino porque son increíblemente adictivas. No importa lo retorcidos que sean los personajes y lo que se oculte en sus mentes, una vez que empiezas este libro, es imposible dejar de leer. Y eso es algo bastante difícil de lograr. "

I wanted to read this before the HBO mini series as I missed the proverbial boat with Big Little Lies. I dislike reading a book after seeing it in visual form as it influences my personal take on the characters and story. I thought this has an excellent storyline and it was well written. I liked the occasional flashes of black humour which were periodically inserted into the drama. Although I have absolutely zero experience of small town America this book illustrated my vision of it as it was so well described and it felt alive. There were some fascinating characters that were easy to envision and I loved the use of interesting and original imagery. As an aside American foodstuff continues to baffle me - the mind boggled at what’s ‘Big Mouth with a strawberry pop’ was. It’s possibly less interesting than it sounds. For me, this was an ‘unputdownable’ read and has more twists and turns than a switchback. Oh boy were Camille’s family damaged - as of course was she in every sense of the word.

Camille is a reporter for a second-rate newspaper in Chicago, sent back to her Missouri hometown to cover the murders of two preteen girls. Needless to say, things for Camille, who had a recent stay in a psychiatric hospital, don't go all that well back in her old stomping grounds. As she tries to get fodder for a good story, she reopens old wounds (both literally and figuratively) and realizes that as bad as things may seem, they're actually a bit worse. While I had a feeling about how I thought the book would close, I was completely captivated even though the story really creeped me out. Even the ""evil"" characters are more than one-dimensional. The sad part is, communities like this--and situations like this--really do exist in this world, although perhaps not quite in the extreme. Great story, and can't wait to read Flynn's next book!"

Then again, I kind of think that is part of what makes her writing so compelling...that she is willing to go where others won't, that her characters are so despicable, so flawed and so hopelessly wounded and broken.Bottom line, she's a talented writer whose greatest gift seems to be her ability to produce characters we love to hate and hate to love. I've enjoyed all three books, even though there were things I disliked. Not recommended to readers who crave silver linings and happy endings."

If I wouldn't have been able to guess the murderer so early on I probably would have enjoyed it more. I felt that it was very obvious who did it. I had way to high of expectations for this book.The quickest way to explain what this book is about is this; Camille Preaker is a journalist who is given an assignment causing her to travel back to her hometown to report on the deaths of two girls. While being back home she has to stay with her estranged mother and little sister she doesn't know. While reporting on the story she also tries to figure out who killed the two girls, Ann and Natalie.I could see this book being a really great and interesting read for some but for me it just didn't cut it.

And I have no argument with the writing. It must have been a difficult one to write since one has to think of all these horrible things before one commits to the page.

Camille returns to her hometown to report on the death of a preteen girl, with a second having gone missing. Camille never goes home to visit her mother or half-sister, so this is a struggle for Camille especially after the things Camille has been through.I'll stop there with fear of giving too much away, but I definitely couldn't get enough of Sharp Objects.

She travels back to her home town to write an article about the murders of two girls. It's a small town, population 2000. Most of people there have know each other since childhood and no one believes that the killer could be one of the locals. Cute little town, full of high school sweethearts with their cute little families, houses with the white picket fences and 2,5 kids. Streets are full of cute little boys and girls running around.Cute, right? Well, as you read you discover that behind the close doors, of those cute houses, lives some very disturbing people. The more you read the more it looks like it was a job of a local. Pretty much everyone starts looking suspicious. You reach the point in the story where almost everyone looks, sounds and acts like a serial killer :).Some very dark and disturbing secrets start coming out and at this point you think that anyone of them could have done it. There is a lot of speculation going on, who could have done it and most importantly why? Who could be so evil to hurt a child. Flynn is brilliant at playing games with readers minds. She creates characters that are very hard to like and even harder to figure it out. It's almost impossible to figure it out who the killer is. I have changed my theory on who that might be, maybe a dozen times. Just when you think you know who did it, something happens and you start doubting. It's very fun to read (aside from the fact that kids are being murdered, of course).I would have given it a 5 starts if it wasn't for the ending. It's fine the way it ended, but I felt like the ending was a bit rushed. It almost felt like ""Oh, by the way..."". I think that epilogue was completely unnecessary. I would have loved for the story to have ended with  Lily Burke disappearance. Readers would still have known who did it and maybe why, plus, it would have left readers surprised and in shock, with bunch of questions ""How? When? Why?"". How and when is not important, and as to why, the story had enough information about the murders and characters, for the reader to figure it out. Other than that, it was a brilliantly written story, total page turner. "

Nếu ai đã đọc ""Gone Girl"" rồi ""Dark Places"" và cuối cùng là cuốn này thì sẽ thấy rõ được sự tiến bộ từng bước trong tài năng viết văn của nữ nhà văn có một không hai này :))Dĩ nhiên, nói như thế không có nghĩa là cuốn tiểu thuyết này dở. Mà ngược lại, đây là viên đá nền tảng để từ đó Gillian Flynn tạo dựng hình ảnh một nhà văn với lối viết và cách xây dựng cốt truyện, nhân vật rất đặc trưng mà hầu như không có nhà văn nào thuộc thể loại mystery/thriller trên văn đàn hiện nay có thể làm được.Các nhân vật của Gillian Flynn hoàn toàn không hoàn mỹ, ngược lại là đằng khác, với đầy những tội lỗi, tính xấu, sự điên loạn và bí mật lèn chặt trong con người và cuộc sống của họ. Đó là những người phải vật vã đối mặt với khóc tối trong bản thân mình, với tâm thần bất ổn và những chứng bệnh tâm lý đe dọa mạng sống của không chỉ họ mà còn những người xung quanh - những con người luôn bước đi trên lằn ranh mong manh của yêu và ghét, của thương và hận. Cuốn sách này có đủ tất cả những điều đó.Cái kết thúc thì ôi thôi khỏi nói, bất ngờ và ám ảnh đúng chất Gillian Flynn. Nó cho người đọc thấy con người, cụ thể là những người trẻ, có thể điên loạn và xấu xa và tàn nhẫn và đáng sợ đến mức nào. Nó một lần nữa chứng minh rằng ""sông sâu khó lội, lòng người khó đo"", và những gì tồn tại trong cái đầu bé nhỏ của một số người có thể còn đáng sợ hơn cả những bộ phim kinh dị đáng sợ nhất. Tuy nhiên, điều đáng nói và đau lòng hơn cả, là cái sự đáng sợ trong suy nghĩ và hành động của một số người ấy, nhiều khi lại là kết quả từ sự đối xử kỳ dị và xấu xa điên loạn của những người thân yêu bên cạnh họ. Không thể ngờ một tác giả có cuộc đời yên ổn, hạnh phúc bên gia đình, bạn bè lại có thể tao ra được những nhân vật đúng kiểu psycho dị hợm đáng sợ ám ảnh và những câu chuyện bí ẩn gia đình tàn nhẫn hãi hùng thấy ghê như vậy :)))) Kiểu này chắc sách nào của bà Flynn ra tui cũng phải mua về cho bằng được để đọc ngay và luôn quá :D"
280,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/116193043-amy-estridh,Rating 1 out of 5,"Why does Flynn hate women?Let’s break this down into three stacks - story/plot, female/male display, and writing.Gillian Flynn has an excellent writing technique, I don't hold that against her. She builds beautiful sentences, gives depth to characters, and proposes a sufficient amount of descriptions and surroundings. Sharp objects start passive and moderately without giving a lot of impressions. I was never intrigued until somewhere in the middle, more specifically, when it became obvious who committed the crime and the circumstances around it. At this point, I thought there's no way it can be this revealing already. Well, it was. The plot-twist was out in the open before I came close to finish it. This is not even the part that bothered me the most.What gave me the bitter aftertaste in my mouth was the women and their extremely, dislikable characters - practically the climate surrounding women throughout the whole book was disgusting. Their empathy is non-existent; they stab each other in their backs, they are slut-shaming, hateful, and awful people. I'm not exaggerating when I'm saying that there's not a single, decent female character in the whole book. The only (few) respectable characters are men. That says something,I could give numerous examples to support my initial hypothesis, but I will stick to my absolute favorite and distasteful quote: ""Sometimes drunk women aren't raped; they just make stupid choices."""
281,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"Sharp objects is a dark mystery/thriller and definitely won't be for everyone. On reflection, I'm not sure it was for me. However, I can very much appreciate Gillian Flynn's writing style as refreshingly blunt, somehow without being too graphic. Honestly though, the themes she explores in this novel are definitely disturbing and left me feeling a bit freaked out. The story itself appears to be a fairly typical crime novel where the main character has a back story, but there is so much more to it than that. All the characters are majorly messed up. The crime itself has elements of being pretty warped. And the further the book progresses and the more things that come to light, the weirder it all gets.Overall, I'm glad I gave one of her books a try, but I don't think I'll be able to stomach another one for a little while."

291,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1283951-evie,Rating 4 out of 5,"Have you ever suffered from reader's block? I have had a mild case since last fall. Ever since I can remember, I have always been reading something. My reader's block doesn't prevent me from actually reading, but it's like some kind of internal parasite that prevents me from fully absorbing what I read, or being refreshed and nourished by a good book. I simply go through the motions, and am mildly entertained by a book, at the most. I never really thought about it, until I was having a discussion with a fellow book nerd friend this week. We were discussing some recent reads of ours, and she noted that I had that spark in my eye again, and that my enthusiasm was infectious. Sigh. I hadn't even realized I'd missed it! In trying to piece things together, I really can't determine what's changed between now and then. What I can do is tell you which recent reads got me excited about reading again, and whetted my voracious appetite for the printed page. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿I have been on my library's super long list to read a copy of Gillian Flynn's latest novel Gone Girl. It hasn't been out for a long time, but already it's received glowing reviews. I own her two previous novels, and had even attempted to read her first book Sharp Objects a couple of years ago, but had abandoned it after 4 pages ( I don't even remember why). So I decided to give it another shot, hoping that this time I'd be in a mood to appreciate it. Was I ever. This book scared me! Almost every review or description of Flynn's work mentions adjectives like ""dark"" and ""gripping"". That is exactly what it was. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿  Chicago reporter Camille Preaker is fresh out of the psych hospital, and assigned to cover a string of bizarre child murders in her small, Midwest hometown. Not too long after arriving, although intent on interviewing the victims' family and eyewitnesses, Camille's personal life starts creeping into her investigation, and she starts identifying with the victims a little too much. Add to that mix uncooperative townsfolk a la Twin Peaks, and a bizarre mother-daughter-sister relationship plot angle, and you've got yourself one page-tuner of a book. Although Camille is a flawed and unreliable character (she makes some pretty stupid decisions), my heart just went out to her so much! I'm pretty sure we'd be friends. A few days after I'd finished reading Sharp Objects, I found an author interview about it that really touched on why it was so...uncomfortable. According to Flynn, the heart of this book was based on the women characters, and the kinds of female relationships we develop throughout different stages of our lives; these inevitably shape us, even when we think we've left them in the past. How many of us don't still have dreams (or nightmares, depending on which circles you ran in) about high school? Are we leaders or followers? Do bullies ever change, or do they just master the old mask trick? And of course the age old question: are some people just ""bad seeds""? So many questions! These themes are not uncommon in chick-lit and chick-flicks. Why just the other day I was watching the movie You Again, and my heart just went out to Kristin Bell's character. I can totally relate! Anyway, I applaud Flynn for taking a washed up theme, and running the opposite way with it. Very unique. I just started her next novel, Dark Places. I hope I am not disappointed."
292,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7741606-sam,Rating 1 out of 5,"Gillian Flynn's first novel. As I read the last sentence, my first thought was how could this possibly have been published, did the publisher even read it? I read the author's other 2 novels and I liked them up to a certain point. They were page-turners, but crashed and burned, for what seemed like convenience. The author got lost and didn't know how to make it work. Sharp Objects was a train wreck from the first pages.Plot-Was there one? Sure I guess. An attempt at a murder mystery? Psychological thriller? Suspense? I am not really sure where to classify this book. Unlike her other books, this novel's storyline was flimsy. The surprises were not really surprises. At about 14-15% she drops a giant clue to the big twist at the end. It stood out like it was decorated in lights, it didn't fit with the flow of the story. If you are going to write a novel about serial killers, murder in a small town, or psychological drama, you definitely need suspense or action. This book had neither. Nada. Zip. Zilch. It was like reading the yellow pages. She made small attempts, but in the end the characters/setting just made you shake your head.Characters-A believable, well developed main character can save almost any plot. Too bad this novel didn't have a main character like that or even any secondary character to hold my interest. The characters in this novel were dull, unbelievable shells. Not one character acted appropriately in situations based on the background the author gives you. One character is described as timid and shy, yet 20 pages later she is in the main characters face, outgoing and bubbly. The main character is a shadow. Who is she? No idea. She could be anyone. She likes to drink, that is the only thing I can say for sure. Her reactions to situations cover all extremes. The big-shot detective acts like no law enforcement official ever would, not even the crooked, slimey ones. He acts like a college frat boy, playing police to get in some girl's pants. Amma is a deplorable character. Her actions and her age do not mesh at all. Overall, I hated each and every character from start to finish. The best ending I can think of for this book is a nuclear explosion killing them all.Annoying inconsistencies and padding-You never really know how old the main character is. Throughout the novel, phrases like 20 years ago, when I was 13, 5 years ago, 3 months, fly around with no regard for a set timeline. I thought she was 24 then 31 then 33 then 31 then in the end 28. Who knows. There was also the annoying addition of characters that did not matter one bit (i.e. Camille's high school friends). They added nothing to the story. Gillian Flynn also thought, after adding about 20 characters with common forgettable names, to put the women's' maiden names in parentheses after their married names. Who cares! The small town setting was also a joke. I live in a similar size small town and we do not have the endless mansions, neighborhoods, and bars this one does. 11 bars for 2500 people. ELEVEN. Please. Do your research. The setting of this book in no way felt small town.If I could give this book negative 5 stars, I would. The only positive thing was that it was so short, I didn't have to suffer too long."

Men, sure, they have bone snaps, they have backaches, they have a surgery or two, yank out a tonsil, insert a shiny plastic hip. Women get consumed. Not surprising, considering the sheer traffic a woman's body experiences."" (204)Sharp Objects by Gillian Flynn reads like a contemporary southern gothic novel, full of deranged and delusional characters set against the backdrop of a small Missouri town of Wind Gap. Camille Preaker, a Chicago based reporter, is ordered by her boss at her small newspaper to investigate the disappearance of a young girl in her hometown alongside the murder of another young girl that happened just a year before. Psychologically damaged and hesitant to visit Wind Gap for a variety of reasons, Camille reluctantly takes the job, knowing full well the horrors she must try to overcome that she escaped years beforehand.This book is unique among most novels in that most of the female characters written are...well, to use a more mild form of word: dysfunctional. Camille, her mother Adora, her baby sister Amma, and most of the female inhabitants of Wind Gap are written in an almost psychologically grotesque fashion. Camille suffers from her mother's bizarre behaviour and carves words onto her body in an attempt at feeling something she could never quite get from her. Adora is inflicted with a wicked sense of Munchausen by proxy in which she causes harm to people under her care, specifically her own daughters. Amma is the most careless of them all, choosing to terrorise anyone near her. There aren't any really likeable characters in this novel, and it's even hard to sympathise with any of them, Camille included, but maybe that's Flynn's real intention in writing this book.While Sharp Objects is set around the murder of the two young girls, its storyline goes a lot deeper than that, analysing how dysfunctional homes and families can lead from damaged children into dangerous adults. In its strengths in shines for what it is, but in its flaws (including hard to sympathise for characters and an easy to solve ""whodunnit"") the novel skips a few beats. It will be interesting to see how this novel compares to others by Flynn.Rating 2.5/5"
295,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3214163-brandon,Rating 4 out of 5,"Chicago-based reporter Camille Preaker travels back to her hometown of Wind Gap, Missouri, to investigate a rash of murders targeting the town’s children.I think I bought this book shortly after I had read Gone Girl in 2014. I was desperate for more Gillian Flynn. However, the book sat on my shelf, unread, for four years. Then HBO announced an eight episode limited series adapting the novel and with the series about to hit screens this month, I figured it was time to pick it up.Sharp Objects is an excellent, atmospheric story that cuts to the core. Coming from a cramped community myself, I related a lot to the close-knit cliques and gossipy gabfests that make up small town life. Everyone is in everyone else’s business because really, there isn’t anything else to do. While I love my crime fiction to blossom within a sprawling urban setting, there’s nothing like shoehorning a plot into backwoods rural America where the victims and the perpetrators alike feel the claustrophobic pressure of the violence.The lead, Camille, is a tragic, desperate character who despite a tough demeanor, is consistently on the verge of total collapse. This makes her the perfect lead – she’s clumsy, she makes a whole hell of a lot of bad decisions and mistakes, but Flynn does a great job in allowing the reader into her life, fully and completely. Keep in mind, she’s the only one you’ll really get a good look into as everyone else is harboring their own secrets and intentions. There’s a wide cast of characters and although there are only really a handful of those you suspect behind the murders – not many give you reasons to look upon them favorably as human beings.Like Gone Girl, this is a book where the less you know going in, the better, so I’ve tried to keep it as vague as possible. Trust that if you enjoyed Gone Girl, you will probably like this one just as much – if not more. Gillian Flynn has a way with words, offering up quotes that will stick with you in the long run. I look forward to checking out the rest of her work.“They always call depression the blues, but I would have been happy to waken to a periwinkle outlook. Depression to me is urine yellow, washed out, exhausted miles of weak piss.”"

Admito que vi la serie cuando salió sin haberlo leído y si bien recordaba algunas cosas, no todas, aún así lo disfruté enormemente.Camille es una reportera que es enviada a su pueblo natal a investigar el caso de unas niñas muertas. Ahí revivirá todos los momentos de su complicada infancia y la tóxica relación con su madre y hermanastra, mientras desenreda el misterioso crimen.Gillian Flynn es maravillosa escribiendo libros con personajes complejos, los tres libros de ella han tenido estas protagonistas tan oscuras como interesantes. Acá no se trata de la bondad innata, ni de ser buenos porque sí, sino de las elecciones que se van tomando. Camille no es perfecta, está lejos de serlo, pero intenta no hacer el mal; ahí está la diferencia. Es una mujer atormentada por un complicado pasado que ni siquiera es capaz de verlo con la perspectiva suficiente. A pesar de su personalidad más fría y seca, es una mujer que quiere ser querida y contenida, ser abrazada al llorar y ser cuidada al enfermar.""A veces mis cicatrices tienen vida propia""Adora es un personaje terrible, porque no es una villana como tal, no es que quiera hacer el mal o quiera hacer el daño. Su relación con Camille, el cómo la trata, el cómo le dice descaradamente que no la quiere y nunca la quiso la vuelve un personaje tan cruel. Su incapacidad de ver más allá de sus propios sentimientos y deseos, y el cómo vuelve a su hija en su enemiga personal.El caso de Amma es más complejo, más oscuro, pues es una niña insoportable y cruel, pero sigue siendo una niña. Mucho de su personalidad no tiene que ver con ella como tal, sino que con la forma en que fue criada y ese pueblo enfermo. Es difícil saber hasta dónde es responsable de sus acciones, pues la mayor parte del tiempo no parece tener el discernimiento suficiente para poner el límite moral entre lo que debe y no debe hacer. La detesto, por supuesto que sí, pero no dejo de pensar en si bajo una crianza diferente hubiese sido una niña diferente.Wind Gap es un pueblo enfermo, de verdad, es un lugar horrible que suena como el infierno. Y, de alguna manera, es el infierno para algunos de sus personajes, para los más débiles que no son lo suficientemente atractivos o ricos como para ganarse su espacio. Me sorprendió mucho la naturalidad con la que se hablaba de actos sexuales en niñas de 9 o 13 años. Niñas que cedían a la presión, niñas que hacían daño a otras niñas, que las ofrecían solo porque podían a chicos más grandes. Es un libro sumamente incómodo por este aspecto, porque cuesta asociar muchos de los actos a niños como tal, porque la mente tiende a imaginarlos mínimo como adolescentes.""Una niña criada con veneno cree que el dolor es un consuelo""A pesar de todo lo incómodo y enfermo, es un libro que me mantuvo muy entretenida y enganchada, de hecho, a pesar de saber muchas cosas por la serie lo disfruté como si no supiera nada. Necesitaba una historia así, que me mantuviera en vilo con cada cosa que pasara y con la misma psicología de los personajes. Más allá de los giros que tiene y los descubrimiento, lo que más atrae son sus personajes y las acciones que cometen, lo difícil que es predecir sus actos o reacciones.Heridas abiertas es un thriller psicológico que nos lleva a un pequeño pueblo en el que las mismas niñas son sus enemigas, en el que se cometen actos sexuales terribles y parece más un infierno que un idílico pueblo sureño.

Read on the WondrousBooks blog.
I read Gone Girl before the movie hype and I wasn't very impressed: the author was trying to shove her ""rich"" vocabulary in every sentence and the characters were EXTREMELY hard to like. At the time I thought the latter was a minus. In this book however, which is weirdly released earlier than Gone Girl, the fucked up people are just one piece of this ingenious, twisted thriller.I read a couple of reviews of Sharp Objects which drew my attention(thank you, GR friends!) and I'm SO GLAD I decided to read this. Sharp Objects is the second of Flynn's books that I read and I'm starting to wonder if she was molested as a child or something, but nevertheless, in a wave of crappy thrillers and horrors, Sharp Objects shines!This time around the writing was much more enjoyable and a lot less flashy and pompous(which leads to two possibilities: 1. Gillian Flynn has started writing worse with time, or 2. she was writing from Amy's POV in the way Amy would speak, which is actually a positive thing if it's true.)The characters were so screwed up I don't even know where to start. There was maybe one person who was not a complete psychopath and that was the Kansas detective. Everyone else was cray-cray. I'm wondering if this is a much darker look on reality than necessary, or that American society in some parts has lost more than a few screws. It seems terrifying that children at ages 13 or younger would have random sex, do copious amounts of drugs and booze and show acts of unbelievable cruelty against one another. I can't believe that parents would be so monstrous to their children or that the entire society of a town would consist of maniacs and lunatics and meth-heads. Or maybe I can believe it, but I really don't want to. Either way, Sharp Objects shows a very dark and scary world.Dark hair. Full lips, turning down at the corners. Beautiful.Camille: in my opinion she can in no way be taken for a positive character. Her insanity is simply not directed towards others. In the end, I'm not sure she was saved. Not really. Maybe not ever. Pale. Blond. Big-breasted. Beautiful. Not very childlike.Amma: I was very interested in her and could not figure her out for a long time. I finally did, but I still find her unbelievable. Or again, I don't want to believe children like her, cruel, slutty and spoiled, exist.As far as the big spin is concerned, I kind of expected one of the two possible outcomes. I was more surprised by how the book ended than not, so I'm really glad: I've had a long streak of very predictable books lately.The book as  a whole: Creepy, twisted and able to mess with your head. Crazy, cruel and nearly terrifying characters, especially the ""children"". I recommend it strongly, though not to the faint of heart. It's not a BOO! kind of story, it's just very disturbing."
311,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2473504-jennifer,Rating 4 out of 5,"Sharp Objects is author Gillian Flynn's debut novel. After reading Gone Girl and loving it, I wanted to check out Ms. Flynn's other two books Sharp Objects and Dark Places. Sharp Objects was an excellent psychological thriller/mystery with a deeply layered female lead: Camille Preaker. I loved the psychological details added to Camille's character. She is complex, and the reader can puzzle piece together the factors that contributed to her damage. As for the mystery, I thought I had solved it early on in the story but was very surprised by a twist at the end. This is a disturbing but fascinating story about how everyone responds to trauma in different ways. This is not a story about how women survive, overcome the odds, and move on. This is a story about deeply damaged women and the horror they are capable of.

The characters were unbelievable (I've found repeatedly that I can't buy Flynn's characterizations of young people). The plot is so implausible."" I couldn't allow myself to give in to the suspension of belief necessary to accept this book which tries to convince that horrific, harmful instances can take place as close as the next bedroom over. All the while, another part of me is thinking to myself: ""If you're gonna go for big, soapy, campy thrills, might as well pump up the volume and make it absolutely insane (like the author later did with Gone Girl). That ending was disappointingly predictable."" I found that this book ended up stuck in an awkward spot somewhere in the middle of the two much like Natalie Keene's body shoved into the gap between two buildings by a gang of baby prostitutes.Having read each of Gillian Flynn's books now in reverse order, I can appreciate the growth in her writing since 2006 when this was published. Each book left me feeling guilty and shameful and grimy and completely unable to stop as I enjoyed the downward spiral they took me on. Perhaps this book most of all made me cringe because of the self-harm and explicit sex. Who would have thought that such a cringe-inducing thriller would be so readable!? If nothing else, I have to give it to Gillian Flynn- no author before has made me feel so sick inside and so desperate to come back for more. "

Definitely more psycho than thriller, cutting isn't just an essential part here - this cuts deep. And so very well written. The disfunctional family, the unhealthy relationships, deep spiritual abyss, the murders, mental health issues - everything about this story is so fucked up on so many levels. The mysterious-small-town vibes, where every single character has issues and seems so tragic, make the perfect setting. The only likeable character was Richard and I felt so sorry for him. But the way Camille screwed this up was so good for the story. Flynn has a twisted way of storytelling, just as our main character Camille. This story is so sad and disturbingly dark yet dripping with sarcasm. The numerous basic details and descriptions plot a lively picture. The metaphoric language, the bits and bobs, that transport just the right mood, sucked me into this intricate story. This story is just something different. It left me unnerved. It's gripping and tense, full of psychological power. It develops slowly. It's disturbing and creepy, sad and sick, confusing but so so good!"

Gillian Flynn writes as horrific material as any horror writer, but keeps it in our neighborhood with 'monsters' who we are married to or raised us. She can write about the unspoken nuances of life and those spaces in-between with a non-elaborate but effective and economical prose. Incredible talent, interesting and complex mind. If there is one living author who I want to meet, it might be her. I have contacted her literary agent and offered for her next novel to be carved into my own skin, word by word, page by page.

The ending was surprising and original. Gillian Flynn is truly an ingenious and extremely talented author. Her writing is compelling and expresses the story perfectly."

Ако с ""Не казвай сбогом"" успя да ме изненада и да ме държи в напрежение до самия край (абе изобщо голям фен съм на Gone Girl), с ""Отворени рани"" успя да ме смути. Има нещо много мрачно и психарско в начина, по който пише, което приветствам радушно. След известно време ще пробвам и ""Мрак""."

Better watch the movie adaptations. Because I just cannot stand the thought process of the narrator. I liked Gone Girl as a movie. I was planning to read that one but I really don't know about that too."

There were times where I became bored with the chatty interactions and was actually leaning toward rating this 3 stars, but I'll keep it at 4. Mostly because she kept it short. "

I was tempted to read or at least watch Gone Girl before this one, but like I said, I’m in one of the worst reading slumps I had this year and I’m in the mood to binge watch TV Shows. Then I stumbled across the Sharp Objects miniseries starring *gasp* AMY ADAMS! Now, we can’t do that without reading the book first can we?Some people say Sharp Objects is Gillian Flynn’s best work, even more so than Gone Girl. So what better way to start reading Gillian Flynn than starting with what is considered her best work, yes?I’m going to keep this short because what else can I say? There’s a way about this book that places you inside the main character, Camille’s mind. It’s not a fun experience, nor was it a pleasing one. In fact, Gillian Flynn did her characters in such a powerful way that it sent literal shudders in some parts. Camille is a complicated individual; we didn’t know this when we go in, but as the story goes, you begin to notice dark patterns, strange behaviors and a glimpse of her dark past. These are done in such a disquieting manner that makes you uncomfortable. It’s like a feeling you have when you go to your attic in the middle of the night, looking at the corners to check if someone or something is going to jump at you. Does that make sense? Probably not. The thing is, it’s disturbing. But the fact that it’s disturbing is exactly the only way that it could go right. These characters (literally everyone, not just Camille; because everyone in this book is fucked up) are so disturbing they wiggled themselves in your psyche. Talk about psychological thriller.Unfortunately, I feel like I was quite letdown with the reveal in this book. It was surprising, sure. But it wasn’t something that is mind-blowing because I feel like if you pay attention; like really pay attention, you would probably get the killer right by the first guess. It’s still a unique experience for me though; this book is such a roller coaster and I’m looking forward to read her other books."
327,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55808848-brad,Rating 4 out of 5,"I liked Sharp Objects by Gillian Flynn much better than her buzzy book, Gone Girl. “Chicago reporter Camille Preaker is asked by her editor to go back to her home town of Wind Gap, Missouri to report on the deaths of two little girls. Camille must deal with her neurotic mother and the half-sister she barely knows to find answers. And her own memories and demons burn to the surface. Can she help find a killer?” There are some disturbing themes in this book. Many incidents of underage rape ate treated matter-of-factly, as well as middle school drug and alcohol use. I realize it’s part of the story but it’s disturbing. Wind Gap might rival Derry, Maine for evil. This was GF’s first book and the hardcover is available as an extra with #BOTM. A quick read and you probably won’t guess the killer. And another Brad character that’s useless. C’mon writers - let Brad save the day just once."
328,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111727368-magen-bone-chilling-books,Rating 4 out of 5,"Listen. If you’re looking for a dark and disturbing book, you gotta read Sharp Objects. I say this, but I’m fairly certain I’m the last person on the planet who has read this book 🤷🏼‍♀️Not quite sure it took me this long to read another Gillian Flynn novel, but here we are.Kept hearing how messed up this book was and since I love dark thrillers, I finally said ok, this is happening now.This book is not for the faint of heart. If you can’t handle Karin Slaughter novels then you will not be able to handle this one.I would love to interview Gillian and see how she comes up with the stuff that she does. It’s brilliant. I also need her to write another novel. For now, I guess I’ll settle with diving into Dark Places at some point.😮‍💨 This one is wild. Don’t say I didn’t warn you."
329,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5143096-geraldine-geraldinereads,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is Gillian Flynn's darkest and possibly her best?! I would rank this as her best followed by dark places, and then gone girl as my least favorite. Also, I realized she hasn't released a novel in a really long time👀Anyways, this was very dark and raw and very well done. I'm excited to see how they adapted the book! "
