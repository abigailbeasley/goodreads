On the highway below, the school bus rolls past without stopping. I am only 7, but I understand that it is this fact more than any other that makes my family different. We don't go to school. Dad worries that the government will force us to go, but it can't because it doesn't know about us. Four of my parents' seven children don't have birth certificates. We have no medical records because we were born at home and have never seen a doctor or nurse. We have no school records because we've never set foot in a classroom.
Educated is both a tale of hope and a record of horror. We know from the first page of her book that Tara Westover is a bright woman, a gifted writer with an impressive, poetic command of language. But her early life offered no clue that she would become a Cambridge PhD or a brilliant memoirist. She was the youngest of seven children born to Gene and Faye (not their real names) Westover, fundamentalist, survivalist Mormons, in rural Idaho. Tara Westover - image from her The Times
We had a farm which belonged to my grandfather, and we had a salvage yard full of crumpled-up cars which belonged to my father. And my mother was a - she was an herbalist and a midwife. And as children, we spent a lot of hours walking on the mountain, gathering rose hips and mullein flowers that she could stew into tinctures. So in a lot of ways, it was a very beautiful childhood. - from NPR interview The children constituted his workforce in Gene’s scrapyard. Father was the law in their household, but it was a rule informed as much by significant mental health issues as it was by his ardent religious beliefs. In a less rural, less patriarchal, less religious community, theirs could easily have been deemed an unsafe environment. The scrapyard was a particularly dangerous place.
…he just didn't have that bone in his head that said, this is dangerous; don't do this. And he had a really hard time understanding injuries even after they had happened and how severe they were. I just - I don't know what it was about the way his mind worked. He just wasn't able to do that. - from NPR interview Ruby Ridge had occurred when Tara was five, and fed her father’s paranoia. Everyone had to have head-for-the-hills bags for when the government, Deep State, Illuminati, choose your own boogeyman, would come for them. He had a profound distrust of the medical profession, believing that doctors were agents of Satan, intent on doing harm. He saw the herbalism Faye practiced as the only true, righteous treatment for one’s ills, calling her products “god’s pharmacy.” And he practiced what he preached, for himself as well as for his children, even after suffering a devastating injury. Maybe not an ideal way to make sure your kids reach adulthood in one piece.View from Buck Peak - image from Westover’s siteHome schooling was also less than idyllic, with mom’s attention spread not only over seven children but to her work as an herbalist and later, in addition, a midwife. Luke had a learning disability, frustrating mom, who really had hoped to educate them all. Dad undermined this, dragging the kids out to do chores and learn practical skills. Eventually mom gave up. Education consisted of Faye dropping them at the Carnegie Library in town, where they could read whatever they wanted. Dad rustled the boys at 7am, but Tyler, who had an affinity for math, would often remain inside, studying, until dad dragged him out.
…there was not a lot of school taking place. We had books, and occasionally we would be kind of sent to read them. But for example, I was the youngest child, and I never took an exam, or I never wrote an essay for my mother that she read or nothing like kind of getting everyone together and having anything like a lecture. So it was a lot more kind of if you wanted to read a book, you could, but you certainly weren't going to be made to do that. - from NPR interviewSuccessful schooling or not, Tara acquired a desire for and love of learning. Tyler, a black sheep, not only loved books but music, as well. This was a major tonic for Tara, who was smitten with the classical and choral music her brother would play on his boom box. Not only did she find a love for music, but she discovered that she has a gift for singing. Being a part (often the star) of the town musical productions gave her greater contact with peers outside her family than she had ever had before. It formed one pillar of her desire to go to school, to college, to study music. (I included a link in EXTRA STUFF to a music video in which she sings lead, so you can hear for yourself.)At age seventeen, Tara Westover attended her first school class, at BYU, clueless about much of what was common knowledge for everyone else, resulting in her asking a question in class about a word everyone, I mean everyone, knows. Oopsy.Her intellectual broadening and education forms one powerful thread in her story. How her natural curiosity emerged, was nurtured, discouraged, and ultimately triumphed. The other thread consists of the personal, emotional, psychological, religious, and cultural challenges she had to overcome to become her own person.The world in which Westover was raised was one in which a powerful patriarchy, fed by a fundamentalist religious beliefs, applied its considerable pressure to push her into what was considered the proper role for a young woman, namely homemaker, mother, probably following in her mother’s dual careers as herbalist and midwife. And what about what was the right course for Tara? There was some wiggle room. Once dad sees her perform on stage, he is smitten, and softens to her musical leanings. Male siblings had been allowed to go to college. But every step outside the expectations, the rules, came at a cost. Do something different and lose a piece of connection to your family. And family was extremely important, particularly for a person whose entire life had been defined by family, much more so than for pretty much anyone who might read her book. Westover as a wee Idaho spud - image from the NY PostA piece of this proscribed existence was a tolerance for aberrant behavior. Father was domineering, and was feckless about physical danger, even as it applied to his children. And distrustful of the medical establishment. His solution for infected tonsils was to have Tara stand outside with her mouth open to allow in the sun’s healing rays. Severe injuries, including Tara having her leg punctured by razor-like scrap-metal, a brother suffering severe burns on one leg, and even dad himself suffering catastrophic third-degree burns in a junkyard explosion, were to be treated by home-brew tinctures. He was also extremely moody, a characteristic that carried forward in some of the family genes. Tara’s ten-years-older brother, Shawn, was a piece of work. She felt close to him at times. He could be kind and understanding in a way that moved her. He even saved her life in a runaway horse incident. But he had a reputation as a bar brawler, as a person eager to fight. Sometimes his rages turned on his own family. And it was not just rage, sparked by trivialities, but cruelty, to the point of sadism. Tara was one of the objects of his madness. Dare oppose him and he would twist her arm to the point of spraining, drag her by her hair, force her face into unspeakable places and demand apologies for imagined offenses. Possibly even worse than this was her family’s denial about it, even when it occurred right in front of them. It is this denial that was hardest to bear. If your own parents will betray you, will not look out for you, in the face of such blatant attacks, then what is the value of the thing you hold most dear in the world?
All abuse, no matter what kind of abuse it is, foremost, an assault on the mind. Because if you’re going to abuse someone I think you have to invade their reality, in order to distort it, and you have to convince them of two things. You have to convince them that what you’re doing isn’t that bad. Which means you have to normalize it. You have to justify it, rationalize it. And the other thing you have to convince them of is that they deserve it. - from C-span interviewHer brother, aliased as “Shawn” in the book, was a master manipulator, who, for years, succeeded magnificently in persuading Tara that what she had just experienced had never really happened.One frustrating aspect of the book is Tara’s dispiriting, but also grating ability to doubt herself, to allow others in her life, bullies, to persuade her she does not think what she is thinking, that she does not feel what she is feeling that she did not see what she has seen. She was living in a gaslit world in which multiple individuals, people who supposedly loved her, were telling her that what she had seen was an illusion, and that bad things that other people did were somehow her fault. Honey, wake the hell up. How many time ya gonna let these awful people get away with this crap? That gets old well before the end. I was very much reminded of victims of domestic abuse, who convince themselves that they must have done something to cause, to deserve the violence they suffer. One can only hope that she has been able to vanquish this self-blaming propensity completely by now. Years of therapy have surely helped. Tara at Cambridge - image from Salt Lake City TribuneShe struggles with the yin and yang of her upbringing and finding her true self. Her father was extreme, but also loving. Her abusive brother had a very kind side to him. Her mother was supportive, but was also a betrayer. Her parents wanted what they truly thought was best for her, but ultimately attempted to extinguish the true Tara. The dichotomy in the book is gripping. At times it reads like How Green Was My Valley, an upbringing that was idyllic, rich with history and lore, both community and family, and featuring a strong bond to the land. Their home was at the foot of Buck Peak, which sported an almost magical feature that looked like an Indian Princess, and was the source of legends. At others, it is like a horror novel, a testament to the power of reality-bending, indoctrination, and maybe even Stockholm Syndrome. How she survived feeling like the alien she was in BYU and later Cambridge, is amazing, and a testament to her inner strength and intellectual gifts. Westover caught a few breaks over the course of her life, teachers, one at BYU, another at Cambridge, who spot the diamond in her rough, and help her in her educational quest. Reading of this support, I had the same weepy joyful feeling as when Hagrid informs a very young lad, “Yer a wizard, Harry.”When setting out to write the book, Westover had no clue how to go about it, well, this sort of a book, anyway. She had already written a doctoral thesis. But she did have stacks of journals she’d been keeping since she was ten. In figuring out how to get from wish to realization, one important resource was listening to the New Yorker fiction podcast, with its focus on short stories. And she took in plenty of books on writing. It is certainly clear that, just as she had the wherewithal to go from no-school to doctorate at Cambridge, she has shown an ability to figure out how to write a moving, compelling memoir. Educated is a triumph, a remarkable work, beautifully told, of the journey from an isolated, fundamentalist, survivalist childhood, through the trials of becoming, to adulthood as an erudite and accomplished survivor. It is a powerful look at the ties, benefits, and perils of families. Ultimately, Educated is a rewarding odyssey you do not want to miss. Review first posted – 3/23/18Published – 2/20/18November 29, 2018 - Educated is named as one of The 10 Best Books of 2018December 2019 - Educated is named winner of the 2018 Goodreads Choice Award for memoirs, beating out Michelle Obamas's blockbuster hit, Becoming. From a GR interview with Westover
Goodreads: Congratulations on your win! What does the award and all the support from Goodreads readers mean to you?Tara Westover: I’m really, really excited about it. It’s great when the highbrow powers that be, the literary giants, say, ""Oh, you wrote a good book,"" but it does mean something extra when it’s readers, when it’s people interacting with the book in a personal way, not just because they like the language or not because they think it’s doing something bold with the form, but because they had an experience with it. That means something a little bit different and a little bit extra. A readers’ award is a really exciting one.

1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62787798-bill-gates,Rating 5 out of 5,"I’ve always prided myself on my ability to teach myself things. Whenever I don’t know a lot about something, I’ll read a textbook or watch an online course until I do.I thought I was pretty good at teaching myself—until I read Tara Westover’s memoir Educated. Her ability to learn on her own blows mine right out of the water. I was thrilled to sit down with her recently to talk about the book.Tara was raised in a Mormon survivalist home in rural Idaho. Her dad had very non-mainstream views about the government. He believed doomsday was coming, and that the family should interact with the health and education systems as little as possible. As a result, she didn’t step foot in a classroom until she was 17, and major medical crises went untreated (her mother suffered a brain injury in a car accident and never fully recovered).Because Tara and her six siblings worked at their father’s junkyard from a young age, none of them received any kind of proper homeschooling. She had to teach herself algebra and trigonometry and self-studied for the ACT, which she did well enough on to gain admission to Brigham Young University. Eventually, she earned her doctorate in intellectual history from Cambridge University. (Full disclosure: she was a Gates Scholar, which I didn’t even know until I reached that part of the book.)Educated is an amazing story, and I get why it’s spent so much time on the top of the New York Times bestseller list. It reminded me in some ways of the Netflix documentary 
Wild, Wild Country
, which I recently watched. Both explore people who remove themselves from society because they have these beliefs and knowledge that they think make them more enlightened. Their belief systems benefit from their separateness, and you’re forced to be either in or out.But unlike Wild, Wild Country—which revels in the strangeness of its subjects—Educated doesn’t feel voyeuristic. Tara is never cruel, even when she’s writing about some of her father’s most fringe beliefs. It’s clear that her whole family, including her mom and dad, is energetic and talented. Whatever their ideas are, they pursue them.Of the seven Westover siblings, three of them—including Tara—left home, and all three have earned Ph.D.s. Three doctorates in one family would be remarkable even for a more “conventional” household. I think there must’ve been something about their childhood that gave them a degree of toughness and helped them persevere. Her dad taught the kids that they could teach themselves anything, and Tara’s success is a testament to that.I found it fascinating how it took studying philosophy and history in school for Tara to trust her own perception of the world. Because she never went to school, her worldview was entirely shaped by her dad. He believed in conspiracy theories, and so she did, too. It wasn’t until she went to BYU that she realized there were other perspectives on things her dad had presented as fact. For example, she had never heard of the Holocaust until her art history professor mentioned it. She had to research the subject to form her own opinion that was separate from her dad’s.Her experience is an extreme version of something everyone goes through with their parents. At some point in your childhood, you go from thinking they know everything to seeing them as adults with limitations. I’m sad that Tara is estranged from a lot of her family because of this process, but the path she’s taken and the life she’s built for herself are truly inspiring.When you meet her, you don’t have any impression of all the turmoil she’s gone through. She’s so articulate about the traumas of her childhood, including the physical abuse she suffered at the hands of one brother. I was impressed by how she talks so candidly about how naïve she once was—most of us find it difficult to talk about our own ignorance.I was especially interested to hear her take on polarization in America. Although it’s not a political book, Educated touches on a number of the divides in our country: red states versus blue states, rural versus urban, college-educated versus not. Since she’s spent her whole life moving between these worlds, I asked Tara what she thought. She told me she was disappointed in what she called the “breaking of charity”—an idea that comes from the Salem witch trials and refers to the moment when two members of the same group break apart and become different tribes.“I worry that education is becoming a stick that some people use to beat other people into submission or becoming something that people feel arrogant about,” she said. “I think education is really just a process of self-discovery—of developing a sense of self and what you think. I think of [it] as this great mechanism of connecting and equalizing.”Tara’s process of self-discovery is beautifully captured in Educated. It’s the kind of book that I think everyone will enjoy, no matter what genre you usually pick up. She’s a talented writer, and I suspect this book isn’t the last we’ll hear from her. I can’t wait to see what she does next."
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5032725-debra,Rating 3 out of 5,"""It's strange how you give the people you love so much power over you""I am in the minority on this one, but this did not blow me away. I wanted to read this after seeing so many high ratings. I was expecting to love this book but ended up feeling meh about it. I actually wanted to hurry the book up in parts and other times found it to be a little repetitive. There were other times I wanted her to go into more detail or explain things more. One thing I had an issue with is that her family is described as survivalists who educated their children at home - many of which do not even have a birth certificate - but then they had many modern conveniences. Her father has a junkyard and a huge distrust of the government. Her Mother becomes a midwife at her husband's urging and makes tinctures and uses herbs to cure those in her family and in their community. I do realize that the family acquired the telephone due to her Mother's job as a mid-wife but then I wondered how they paid for everything. .Tara grows up free or wild. She didn’t bathe that often, didn’t wash her hands after using the restroom, and is unaware of world history, and is quite comfortable living around bad odors and smells. She is abused by an older brother and no one seems to notice, intervene, or even care. They seem to be a reckless group - example: multiple car accidents, etc. I had a hard time believing some of the information presented. Case in point the first car accident in the book, Tara's father offered to pay for the damaged tractor. Where did they get the money? Just how much does farm equipment cost? It's not cheap, I know that. Even if the farm equipment purchased is used it still must be pricey. Plus, the damage to their car would mean they would need to purchase another. Then the family has another car accident. More money, lots of injuries, possible need for another vehicle, etc. I am not saying that none of this happened, but I had a lot of questions about how things were paid forPlus, this family seemed to be very accident prone, falling from surfaces, fires, head injuries. Was this because they were raised without any rules and became reckless, or did bad things just happen to them?Tara does want a better life for herself. She does educate herself at home, so she can pass the test to get into College. College isn't cheap, nor are book, nor is housing or food. Again, I wondered how she paid for all of this. Plus, once she got to college, she didn't seem to mind that her roommates were upset with the smell in their home. Dirty dishes, not bathing, not having clean clothes. I get if this is the norm, in the home she grew up in but when faced with other's displeasure, I would think a smart girl like her would have taken the hint that being clean and living in a clean environment is the norm, not how she was raised. Plus, at home a young man even pointed out to her that her home smelled as did she.There was a part of this book that I did enjoy. Tara's thirst for knowledge and teaching herself and gaining entrance to college without a formal education. I appreciated her struggles and having to learn how to ""learn"". She went on to achieve a lot in her life and it is impressive and commendable. Tara definitely was an under dog and I did root for her. She definitely changed her life and sought for better for herself. Even without a lot of support from her family, she found strength and kept going. This is what shined for me in this book with otherwise left me with questions. Who doesn't want to root for her? I did. Having said that, there were just too many questions raised why reading this. I don't care if someone is a survivalist, I would think one would still want their children to be safe and free of harm. The turning the blind eye to abuse was despicable. The family also had a lot of modern conveniences which did not gel with my idea of what a survivalist family would own or not own. But I am no expert on survivalist families. Her father clearly had some mental health issues and they contributed to his beliefs and possibly to their way of life. Yes, she suffered abuse. Yes, she grew up in a home with an untreated mentally ill parent, yes, it is all very sad but it was still not enough to make me enjoy the book. What worked for me in this book was Tara's drive for a better life. How with very little support from her family, she went out on her own and obtained an education. I appreciated her drive and determination. Her book is well written and I realize this is her account of how she remembers things from her perspective. I just was left with questions hence the 3 star rating.Again, in the minority with this one. Most love this book. It just wasn't for me.I received a copy of this book from Random House Publishing group and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.See more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com"
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1277371-marialyce-back-in-the-usa,Rating 2 out of 5,"2 stars and I know, I am an outlier.I have been born with a gene called the ""doubting Thomas"" gene. It has made me very leery of trusting and believing a lot of things and unfortunately this gene kicked in big time in this story billed as a memoir.While I do believe that the things described by Tara Westover might have happened, I also have to think that this was a book of childhood memories. Sometimes, as children, we distort the truth, and sometimes grown to adulthood we only remember fragments of what happened and when confronted by others realize our memory was somewhat faulty.There are actually quite a few things I just could not wrap my hands around in this story. For one, being a former teacher and having had the pleasure of teaching many gifted and brilliant students, I just could not see what, with the quantum lapses in Tara's education, how she could possibly have made it into both a fairly prestigious college and then onto the highest level of university in England. Learning builds upon itself and being a former math teacher, I can say that if one only had the rudimentary knowledge of the four simple math functions, that going onto higher level math would be virtually impossible. Was it possible that her early education being home schooled was not as lacking as she described it to be?The next issue I had was that of the number of injuries incurred by she and her brothers and her mother just snapping her fingers, using essential oils and other agents and then recovery occurred. Granted, I am not a medical professional, but the incidents described in one or two particular cases was life threatening and yet these techniques done by the mother worked? I know I still blame it on my doubting Thomas gene. I do also have a belief in both holistic and regular medicine being a partnership in the healing process.Next up for me, was Tara's ability to obtain somehow the finances to attend college and then to travel overseas to England and back. Yes, I do know that she was awarded scholarships but what about the incidentals, travel, food not provided in school. Did she live like a hermit and never leave the confines of the school she was attending? From her writing, we know that is not true.Lastly, if indeed these things were happening, where were the people who should have noticed the abuse? Where were the friends, the church goers, the people who did business with the father? Would they have not noticed untoward things happening to the Westover children. Would not at least one of them have come forward? Why are some of them coming forward now to defend this family?So, sorry to say, I am going against the grain of many of my fellow much respected readers and reviewers, and saying that I just could not buy into what was being set forward in this book. I am not an advocate for her parents, nor do I think that things never did happen. Perhaps to me, this book just has not explained the circumstances well enough for the doubting Thomas in me to believe. Thankful to my Traveling Sisters who read this book along with me. We all seemed to share the same ideas on this one and I am glad as always to have my thoughts and feeling able to be expressed to such a wonderful group of avid readers. Also thank you to netgalley, the author and the publisher for providing me with an ARC of this book."
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m,Rating 5 out of 5,"Difficult to read. Impossible to put down. A powerful, powerful book that you shouldn’t miss. I can’t just leave it at that because Tara Westover’s story deserves more than those few words. I don’t often read memoirs, but when I do I want them to be told by extraordinary people who have a meaningful story to tell and that would be faint praise for this book. It sounds odd to say how beautifully written this is because we are not spared of the ugly details of what this family was about, but yet it is beautifully written. I had to remind myself at times that I wasn’t reading a gritty novel, that Tara and her family were real as I got more than just a glimpse of a life that was hard for me to even imagine. A religious fanatic father, hoarding food and guns and bullets and keeping his family off the radar, not filing for birth certificates, not getting medical attention when they needed it, avoiding the government, the feds at all cost , keeping his children out of school, the paranoia, the preparation for the “Days of Abomination” - this is what we find in this place on a mountain in Idaho. There are horrible accidents and he won’t get medical help for his family. Her mother’s healing herbs and tinctures are used to treat the slightest scrape to the most horrible head injury or burns from gasoline to an explosion. If some thing bad happens it because that’s the will of the Lord. Her mother seems at times more sympathetic to her children, but she is complicit by her subservience to her husband. I don’t even know how to describe it other than gut wrenching to see the effects on this family of neglect in the name of religious beliefs and in reality mental illness. It isn’t just her father but the brutality by one of her brother’s which is more than awful and creates rifts between family members,  That she was bold enough and somehow found the will to rise above it all while she is torn with the sense of duty, of loyalty to her family, the ingrained beliefs, still loving her family is miraculous. Going to college was the first time she’d been in a classroom, not knowing what the Holocaust was, learning about slavery, the depression, WWII, the civil rights movement. She doesn’t just get a college education but ultimately a PhD from Cambridge, a Harvard fellowship. She struggles for years to discover who she was, who she could be - a scholar, a writer, an independent woman. This is a stunning, awe inspiring story that will haunt the reader long after the book ends. Thank you to Tara Westover for sharing yourself with us. I received an advanced copy of this book from Random House through NetGalley. Thanks to my friend Diane for bringing this book to my attention. Without her review I might have missed this."
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may,Rating 3 out of 5,"Westover is clearly a decent writer, but I felt underwhelmed by this book. Some things didn't seem to add up. Such as how an uneducated mountain wildgirl clicked her heels together, magicked up thousands of dollars (yeah, yeah, scholarships don't cover everything, you know), and went on to some of the world's most prestigious higher education centres. Intelligence is not the main thing required to attend Harvard or Cambridge; being able to pass exams and perform the system's dance is. Someone without formal education should have no idea how to do that.Also-- are some people magically cured by herbs and finger-clicking here or did I miss some medical intervention along the way?But I think, overall, I was just a little disappointed because everyone seemed to find the survivalist aspect so dramatic and awful. I've read a few books about isolated communities that go off the grid and enforce their own laws and, I have to say, Westover's experience felt pretty tame. Her family were survivalists who spent months canning peaches and hunting for scrap, but is this really that odd? I heard all these promises of ""wilderness"" and ""mountain survivalists"", but they have a phone and TV. I would say this family is more ""eccentric"" than ""survivalist"".Where the book does succeed is as a portrait of physical and emotional abuse. I think this was the most important part of the book and it's been glossed over in favour of people's delight at learning about weirdos running around wild in the mountains. (I'm not judging; I came for that too.) I also found it really interesting and sad when the author suggested that her father's paranoid delusions might have been undiagnosed bipolar disorder. It's a quick read with crowd-pleasing writing, I'll give it that. But it's hard to not feel like something is amiss, and certain events were probably exaggerated. Or, alternatively, Westover's ""survivalist"" family were sitting on a few on-the-grid dollars that conveniently popped up when equipment needed repairs and people needed to go to college. It's also possible that the writing just lacked clarity.Facebook | Instagram "
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57797254-cindy,Rating 5 out of 5,"So good. So good. SO GOOD. Ok, I'll try to elaborate. Tara Westover's memoir is incredibly engrossing not just because of the rollercoaster of traumatic events that occur throughout her life, but also because of her ability to weave humanity and complicated familial relationships in her portrayal of events. While it's easy to take these events and market it like a thriller novel, it's that sense of reflection and poignancy in her carefully crafted words that is the book’s strongest asset. As awful as her family is, she tries to make them as multifaceted as possible by describing both the horrific treatment she dealt with alongside the tender moments that have made it hard for her to let go. I have always been either apathetic or critical about our education system, but I loved Westover’s insights that her education has afforded her to expand her worldview and transform her into her own individual. I would recommend this book to anyone who comes from a dysfunctional family as proof that you don’t have to be trapped in your circumstances and can seek a better life for yourself.A common critique is questioning how much of her memoir is embellished. My gut reaction is to take offense, as these dismissals have implications of not believing a victim of abuse and gaslighting her like her family did. But I know that all memoirs have degrees of embellishments, and it’s fair to have healthy skepticism. However, she peppers several footnotes throughout her memoir that point out contradictions in her memory based on different accounts of her siblings. This indicates that she is aware of how memories can be subjective, and the fact that she even clarified where her own perspectives differed and included different accounts showed that her priority was telling her story as truthfully as she can. That’s all you can really ask of someone bearing their life story. I believe the book and trauma she went through are completely valid, and her efforts in both staying true to her experiences while sharing different accounts reassure me in that validity."

And this is coming from the girl who’s one-starred so many popular books she has an “unpopular opinions” shelf with hundreds of books on it.Can the New York Times Book Review say that?Maybe I should be the more trusted source.Anyway. This is not only beautifully written (and it is beautifully written), it’s stunningly recollected too. The emotional intelligence of the author is so vivid in every page. There is so much empathy here.This is already an incredible, gorgeous story, with a profound and impactful arc, but the talent of the author is what really makes it masterful.Bottom line: This is good sh*t.(You don’t get that kind of blurb from Oprah.)----------pre-reviewoprah was right.review to come / 4.5 stars----------tbr reviewall it takes to convince me to read a book is 500,000 ratings with a 4.48 average + a Goodreads award + tons of nominations + the New York Times, Barack Obama, Oprah, and every major publication naming it one of the best of the year."

The manipulation, the abuse she went through left me speechless. While not unique, family issues are still so taboo. Brainwashing your own self into thinking it's your fault, that it wasn't that bad or that you imagined it will hit way too close for comfort for a lot of people.The author's writing was beautiful and her courage to get an education and stand up to her family was inspiring.Do recommend if you can stomach it."
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1151637-roxane,Rating 4 out of 5,Excellent memoir. Really well written. The story is just horrifying from beginning to end. It really makes you wonder how many people are homeschooling their kids and enabling abuse and indoctrinating kids in all kinds of racist paranoid nonsense. I kept thinking “this is so fucked up” as the story careened from one nightmarish circumstance to the next. It’s amazing what people are able to survive. It’s a shame that survival is demanded of so many.

Grow up.”“Maybe the fact you struggled with mathematics for 16 years mean you struggle to appreciate quality storytelling.” Fucking hell. It’s my opinion. My review. You don’t agree that is absolutely within your rights but don’t start tearing me apart, because I will not argue with you. I’ll just delete your dick comments. *********************DNF on page 234I feel like I’m not reading the same book as everyone else? It’s boring. This happened, and then this happened and then the same thing happens again. Also I know this is supposed to be a memoir but am I honestly supposed to believe her mother survived a brain injury with not a jot of medical care? How she conveniently managed to scrimp enough money for the next semester of college borders on the unbelievable. Her brother is an asshole and I really don’t want to see how that unfolds. She teaches herself trigonometry. Honestly how? I studied maths in the school system for 16 years and still struggled with it. How does someone with absolutely no prior experience with it just teach herself maths at college level?! I know some people pick it up quicker than others but really?! She even gets 100% on an algebra test at college. Maybe I’m being overly harsh, but I’m just not having a good time - good on her for standing up for herself, but this is too wordy, definitely exaggerated and there are way too many other books in the world."

The events are not from a time long ago - they happened in the past 20 years! You will have to keep reminding yourself of that because the mindset and ideas discussed sound antiquated, but they are alive and kicking . . . and that is just crazy!One thing that brought this story close to home is that at the time a lot of the events in this book we're taking place, I was living in Yellowstone National Park and frequently travelled to or through Idaho Falls, Pocatello, Salt Lake City and all points in between. This means I could have been mere miles away from the events in this book while they were taking place! Again, this seems impossible to me and I had to keep reminding myself that this was happening in my neck of the woods! And, because of this, my mind was repeatedly blown.I suppose I should mention what might be a trigger warning for some. Most of the men and some of the women in this book are described doing crazy and abusive things. I swear that every few minutes I had to stop, collect my thoughts, and say, ""Wow!"" While none of us were there to witness this and the author even says there are many who will deny the events and say that her version of the events are driven by the devil himself, they are shocking and will get your mind churning! I feel her frustration and so many times I wanted to reach into the pages and tell her, ""It doesn't have to be like this!""Also, another trigger warning, if you work for OSHA or help maintain OSHA workplace safety standards, you are going to probably throw this book across the room or at least slam it in disgust a few times.This book is amazing and I highly recommend it - I am driven to follow this up by hunting down interviews with the author."

“You can love someone and still choose to say goodbye to them,” she says now. “You can miss a person every day, and still be glad that they are no longer in your life.”
Tara Westover lived her life like everyday was her last - literally. Her dad was a doomsday prepper.She spent her childhood stockpiling supplies, scrapping with her brothers and deeply in penance for her ""sins"". Hospitals were forbidden, schools were forbidden, everything was treated with a homeopathic cure and a long prayer.
My life was narrated for me by others. Their voices were forceful, emphatic, absolute. It had never occurred to me that my voice might be as strong as theirs.
She told again and again that she was worth nothing and shouldn't seek out a life.But...being told something and believing it are two different things. 
We are all of us more complicated than the roles we are assigned in the stories other people tell/
When she was seventeen, Tara went to school for the first time. It was an adjustment - to put it mildly - from her quiet, almost subservient role at home.But the longer she stayed away from home, the more she realized what exactly she was missing...and what she would have to leave behind to seek it.
Curiosity is a luxury for the financially secure.
Just... holy sh*t.Overwhelming... but in an addictive way. Like can't-put-down-its-crack level of addictingI read this one in a single day - and it was worth the late night and early mornings. There's something just so wholly compelling and riveting about her voice. The way she constantly questions and sought out something else - often without truly being aware of what that something else was.The sickly feeling that crept up upon me when her parents and siblings tried to sway her back.It was just amazing.

13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,Rating 2 out of 5,"Here's the thing: when I read a memoir, I'm looking for something real, something that encapsulates enough of the truth as to be authentic. But the events in this book are pretty unbelievable. Tara had never gone to school before applying for college. Her mom tried to homeschool her, but gave up early on. Without ever having studied or developed the discipline for learning, Tara teaches herself a variety of subjects well enough to ace the ACT and get into a good university. This all happens while she's simultaneously working for her dad at a junkyard, getting injured herself and watching others be grievously injured too, and being physically and emotionally abused by her brother.I believe people can do a lot if they put their mind to it, but this is pretty far-fetched. It's natural to embellish the truth in order to tell a good story, but I have to wonder how much of it was really true and how much was the embellishment. Sure, there is a small possibility that everything happened exactly as described. But it's so remote that I have trouble suspending my disbeliefs. If this was fiction, I'd be okay with it. But since it's billed as nonfiction, I'm kind of skeptical.But for me, the most frustrating thing about this memoir is reading about Tara justifying her brother's abuse towards her, and her parents' choice to turn the blind eye to what was going on. She's constantly rethinking what happened, with each subsequent version being more and more watered down until she no longer remembers if her brother even hurt her in the first place. She follows these people like a puppy, begging for their love and attention, even as they continue to mistreat and threaten her.Am I the only one who thinks that's just bananas? She's essentially using the book as a form of therapy to justify the behavior of people who abused her. I'm sorry, but I just can't get on board with that. It was exhausting to read, and it's not clear she made any real progress on getting past this. Even at the end, she seems ready to forgive her parents if they ever say the word.The writing style is philosophical and ruminating, with overly ornate language at times. There are so many passages in which she's overthinking things, but without gaining any of the key insight she really needs.It's ironic this book is called ""Educated,"" when it never makes clear if and what exactly she has learned through all of this."

When I began reading Educated, I was floored that Tara and her siblings were not in school, and they were not homeschooled either. How could this happen in modern times with compulsory schooling put in place long ago? Tara made it clear from the start that her family’s Mormon faith did not cause her father’s substantial paranoia; however, he used his faith to feed it. This family not only did not have insurance, they did not believe in accessing traditional medical care. Horrific accidents and illnesses abounded due to the father’s and one sibling’s risk-taking, and no one went to the doctor. While the family was clearly having difficulty grappling with many things, I was struck by the love and devotion between them, even with the strained family dynamics. It was both fascinating and heartbreaking to watch those dynamics shift even more as Tara’s aspirations developed and were achieved. Strength. Grit. Perseverance. Tara’s tenacity resulted in her leaving the farm at Buck’s Peak and enrolling in college, after never attending a day of school. Her words were upfront, bold, but never complaining or looking for pity. Overall, I found Educated to be one of the most engaging, powerful, and inspiring memoirs I have read. Thank you to Tara Westover, Random House, and Netgalley for this reading experience I will treasure. Educated is now available!"

The wonderful Traveling Sisters group set it up as a slow read and I was in. Grabbed a copy from NetGalley and was ready to go. BUT.....and a big BUT......I didn't like this one, I had to force myself to finish. Had it not been for the group read, I'm sure I would have DNF'd this one.So I'm probably in the minority in not liking this one. It was more of a 'having a hard time believing the story' kinda thing. Tara details her life growing up in the mountains. She paints a picture of this wild child who doesn't bathe, or wash her hands after using the toilet (her grandmother had a fit about this), is quite ignorant, but yet...she self teaches herself to get into a prestigious college. She talks about her childhood and her parents seems so bad - no schooling, must work and earn money, her father seems to be a religious zealot who harbors a fear of the govt, her mother creates tinctures that cure people from near death. It just became a bit much and I was having a hard time believing it all. Multiple car accidents, severe burns, head trauma, and all cured with herbs. But then she wants to go to school, so she does...college, gets a PhD. Where did she get the money? They didn't seem to have much money. Yet, being in the 'mountain' rustic home, they had a phone, tv, internet. I dunno, it was just getting to be a bit much for me to believe. She ended up having multiple siblings teach themselves, go to college, and get advanced degrees. Really?A memoir is defined as an autobiography or a written account of one's memory of certain events. Maybe this is how she remembers everything, maybe it really all happened this way. I really don't know. But it all just did not add up for me. I had so many questions about everything. I have a family member who remembers his childhood different from how I remember HIS childhood. So it happens. I'll just say thanks to NetGalley for an advanced copy of the read and this in no way influenced my review."
16,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,Rating 4 out of 5,"Tara Westover’s book “Educated” is a distressing & discomforting - alarming & startling exposure of her Mormon fundamentalist family. “Educated” is a memoir of nonfiction - but names and identifying details have been changed. Aaron, Audrey, Benjamin, Erin, Faye, Gene, Vanessa, Judy, Peter, Sadie, Shannon, Shawn, Susan, Robert, and Robin are pseudonyms. Tara tells us in her authors notes: “This is not about Mormonism. Neither is it about any other form of religious belief. In it there are many types of people, some believers, some not; some kind, some not. The author disputes any correlation, positive or negative, between the two”. Yet....as I read this novel - I not only felt angry - sickened at times - but really conflicted too. I had duel thoughts from the beginning of this novel to the end. I ‘did’ think - in part this book was about Mormonism ( let’s call a spade a spade). Tara and her siblings had backpacks filled with supplies to defend themselves ready to “head-for-the-hills” ....ready to run ( away from the government).Her dad, Gene, feared that the government might one day try to intervene their lifestyle. They were living off the grid. The kids had no formal education, or medical care when sick or injured. Instead of going to the hospital when needed - their mother, midwife/herbalist cared for them with alternative remedies. The government might have even brought in social workers to evaluate the health their family. Abuse? YES! This family stayed hidden. Abuse in many forms was hidden. Tara’s memoir-impart- also details ( summarizes) the transitions and challenges entering the academic world -Brigham Young University- Harvard- Cambridge ( PhD in History). Her educational journey was interesting — some of it maddening to me also ....not faulting anyone - but it was painful for me to discover just how ‘much’ about the world - life changing world events a 7 year old knew - at age 17 she ‘didn’t’ know - yet somehow was studying at a University. I questioned ‘how was this even possible’? Amazing. Tara had great support from a church entering college...which was wonderful. At times I felt frustrated ‘besides’ some greatly disturbing horrific frightening descriptions during Tara’s childhood. Tara’s academic accomplishments were extraordinary—but I couldn’t find her voice. She seemed - fragile - and often so uncertain of herself. This book is very well written - ( gloomy -perplexing - and wearisome at times from repetitive trips back home to seek validation from her family)- but it seemed her education brought her almost as much pain as it did inner fulfillment. Because Tara disputes any difference between negative and positive —admirable in ways —I had a hard time getting an experience of ‘HER’. I admit it’s my own frustration. This young girl had a childhood I could never fully comprehend- or know what scars remain...but the fact stands — she's living proof that amazing change is possible. Tara calls that “an education”. Alright ....I agree....but I’m still sad and feel incomplete. ( it’s my problem - not hers). There have been comparisons to this book and “The Glass Castle”. I understand that — but in reality they are presented very differently. Not only does Jeannette Walls not change any names in her book — she had just freedom to go on National television with her homeless mother. She didn’t need to hide or change identifying details. Tara Westover felt the need to keep names hidden. ( less freedom between the author and her readers for full- self expression). I understand- but a little less satisfying. I DO FEEL THIS BOOK OUGHT TO BE READ ....I DO SEE THIS BOOK’S IMPORTANCE....a story about an American family living by their own rules - ignoring others who don’t follow their beliefs. WE SEE TARA WESTOVER’S SKILLFUL LYRICISM in this book....very impressive— one of the most inspiring aspects to me. With her achievements, education, and talent, we got a well-written fascinating SAD STORY.I will think about Tara - worry & wonder about her in years to come. It killed me that Tara continued time and time again to seek validation - I’m not sure it’s over. She kept going home to a place where her own brother tried to kill her —She almost begged her mother to see her time and time again too— it was soooo painful to me that her mother rejected her ——but just as painful that Tara kept needing their approval. All so sad. I UNDERSTAND....yet I can’t see who she is through her own behavior. Tara has an inspiring academic education— a relationship with 3 of her siblings but trying to regain a relationship with her parents - her violent brother - and even one of her sisters she was once very close to was like trying to get blood from a turnip....it just wasn’t possible. It made for very frustrating reading. Why did Tara keep trying to fill her heart with the family that rejected her several times? And were abusive? And can a book education take that pain away? These are questions that lingered with me. Tara had a sweet - warm- soft voice on NPR. Her interviewer called her dad a ‘character’. She agreed. All light and fluffy. Tara share About MANY HAPPY CHILDHOOD MEMORIES on NPR. I was a little confused listening to her. Was she happy or angry? She seemed so happy about her childhood. Huh? Yet for years she suffered abuse which she tells us in her book. On NPR:She said the junkyard was playful and exotic, but was dangerous....but also fun.She said the Mountain where she grew up was magical and beautiful.....but they were closed off from the rest of the world. Duality....duality...duality ...... is a word that Tara used over and over again on NPR. Tara see’s two sides to her entire life. I felt a little “duality” in this story myself. I still feel Tara herself is hidden from this story. Can’t put my finger on it. But one thing does hit home — we can’t meet the rest of her family like we were able to of Jeannette Walls. So - this is clearly TARA’S memoir....and I’ll respect it at that. This is a valuable powerful read but I’m guessing there might be more to this story one day. Thank You Netgalley, Random House, and Tara Westover ( congrats to you on your book - may you continue to find inner peace and happiness) 4.4 Stars"

My life was narrated for me by others. Their voices were forceful, emphatic, absolute. It had never occurred to me that my voice might be as strong as theirs.""- Tara Westover, Educated: A MemoirThis book feels like it was written by a sister, a cousin, a niece. Tara Westover grew up a few mountains over from my dad's Heglar ranch. I don't know her. Don't know her family. She grew up about 70-80+ miles South East as the crow flies, but realistically, it was a 1.5 hours drive difference, and a whole planet of Mormonism over. I didn't grow up in Idaho. I was born there and returned there yearly. But this book is filled with the geography, culture, behaviors, mountains, religion, schools, and extremes I understand. She is writing from a similar, and often shared space. I didn't just read this book, I felt it on every page. Her prose was amazing. The memoir danced at parts, while a couple pages later, I would be sent up for air. I often found myself having to talk through parts of the book with my wife while reading. It flowed. Some books seem to remove friction while you read. My wife abandoned work for a day to read it. It consumed us.This book reads like a modern-day, Horatio Alger + The Education of Henry Adams: An Autobiography. However, it isn't just a book about how a girl with little formal education from a small town in Idaho makes it to Cambridge. It is also a tale of escape, and a historiography. Westover is using her own life to do a popular memory study on herself. She is looking at how she viewed her religion, her background, her parents, and her education. She explores how those memories and narratives change and reorient based upon proximity to her family, her father. These narratives especially begin to reorient as she becomes ""educated.""I bought a copy and before I even read it, I gave it to my father to read (He grew up in Heglar, ID). Then I bought another couple and yesterday and today my wife and I raced to finish our respective copies. We bored our kids talking about it over two dinners. We both finished it within minutes of each other tonight. Tara Westover's memoir hit me hard because of the struggle she has owning her own narrative. Through many vectors I related to her (we both graduated from BYU with Honors, were both were from Idaho, educated Mormons, and both have preppers in the family). My family, while sharing similar land, a similar start, and a similar undergraduate education, however, are not Tara's. And that is what made this memoir so compelling. It was like reading a Dickens novel, but one that was set in your neighborhood. It was moving, sad, and tremendous. In the end, I was attracted by how close the story felt, but I was also VERY grateful her story wasn't THAT close."

So, the idea of not being able to go to school, of being deprived of an education, hit me really hard. It was hard for me to grasp that things I take for granted, like knowing what the Holocaust was or who MLK, Jr. was, were black holes to Tara. Tara Westover is the child of a religious fanatic, someone who sees the government as pure evil. And by government, he means schools, hospitals, vaccines, seat belts, car insurance, etc. Everything we think of as civilization. His family awaits the Days of Abomination. There is a similarity here to The Glass Castle. Once again, we see how a mentally unbalanced father holds sway over an entire family. He thinks he speaks for God. Tara struggles with the knowledge that for her to go to school will mean a total separation from her father because he will never acknowledge that his ideas are not the correct ones. Parts of this book are cringeworthy. I found myself shaking my head that folks would allow severe suffering rather than a trip to the hospital or the use of real medicine. I’ll warn you that some of these sections are not for the faint of heart. The descriptions are sickening. I know little to nothing about the Mormon faith. Certainly, the faith of this family is not the true Mormon faith. But you get glimpses enough to also realize that there is a strong anti-woman bias in the faith and that women are definitely second class citizens. Broodmares more than humans on a par with men. This book doesn’t sugarcoat things. It’s not an education makes everything better kind of story. Tara continues throughout the book to struggle to find her way, to stand up for her beliefs. Hell, to find her own beliefs. This is an amazing book. It makes you realize how easy your life is. And how strong folks like Tara are to be able to rise above their beginnings and be able to fight back against the attempts of family to hold them down. I’m willing to bet this book makes it onto a lot of best of 2018 lists. It will certainly be on mine. Highly recommend! My thanks to netgalley and Random House for an advance copy of this book. "

There are multiple miraculous recoveries from numerous life-threatening untreated injuries, a lot of magical money appearing out of nowhere to pay for things Tara needed, a bunch benevolent men throwing opportunities and scholarships at her. Either Tara was a very naturally gifted student or an extremely hard-working student, it's hard to tell. No case was made for either of these possibilities, if I accept that she had received NO structured education. (Does BYU have such low standards BTW?)The survivalist angle was entirely overblown by publicity around this book. If anything, Tara's family was careless and sloppy, with their main oddity being not believing in modern medicine. Canning peaches is not survivalism as far as I know. And it's quite hard to claim to be closed off from the world if you have TV, phone, internet and take dance classes in town. Too much of this story smells like BS, and I am not talking about the abuse, I have no reason to doubt that. It's the details that are a complete mess. The gaslighting Tara had experienced at the hands of her family was the most compelling part of her story actually."

It's not about getting a PhD, it's about growing up in a family that doesn't believe in school, thinks doctors are a part of a sociologist conspiracy, and that any day the government will shoot them dead--if the end of times don't come first. The experiences Tara describes are horrific, yet oddly relatable--even if your family is nothing like hers (and let's hope it isn't). By the end, she has to come to terms with balancing family bonds and having the strength to see past their warped sense of reality.There's really no words to describe it, but I'd start with moving, inspiring, shocking and un-put-downable.

 (James Frey, A Million Little Pieces) rat here. This is what I hate about memoirs. An author can fill page upon page with a load of made up BS and we are meant to fall for it hook, line and sinker. I have made this argument before, even though a memoir is based upon the recollection of the author, it should still be FACTUAL! Let's begin at the beginning. I almost stopped reading this book at page 3. I read the alliterative phrase 'chirping crickets' three times on ONE page. I lived not far from where Tara Westover grew up and we had these:  MORMON CRICKETSNOT these:  REGULAR OLD CRICKETThere is no lovely cricket chirping sound with the first because they are not a cricket. They are actually a katydid. Ok, enough science. Westover is apparently all rolled into one. Jackie Chan because no one alive other than him has suffered the number of life-threatening injuries and survived to tell about - oh wait, except for Tara Westover. Confucius because of her astounding insight and prophetic sayings, and John Stuart Mill because Westover has got the philosophy of feminism down like no other philosopher since Mill. (At least that unsightly knot on Mill's forehead would jive with what Westover should look like if she had been through as many physical catastrophes as she claims).Westover is ready to give these singers a run for their money since she sings like a goddess after never opening her mouth before. WATCH OUT:   Tara Westover will be receiving her Grammy, Tony, Emmy and Oscar before she is 40, I am sure.That is if she is not too busy adding colloquialisms to the vocabulary for the rest of us. Hey, Tara, EVERYONE calls a blinding, windy winter storm a WHITE OUT. They didn't make that up in Idaho. Westover is the greatest thesis writer, the greatest dissertation writer, the greatest student Cambridge has ever seen. All while being a complete idiot. She goes from having no  (Sorry I couldn't resist taking a jab at the end of days BS in this book) to having enough  to fly to ROME and back and forth to the US countless times! That must have been one HELL of a PELL grant. Westover says ""...I'd been surprised to discover echoes of Mormon theology in the great philosophers of the nineteenth century."" Shouldn't that be the other way around - that Joseph Smith ripped off philosophers not that they thought he was so profound as to steal from him?  Her father would have been dead, dead, dead if he had suffered burns to the degree that she claims. He would have contracted an infection or pneumonia and would not have survived. And since the bottom of his face was gone as she purports, how was he able to hold a phone up to his shoulder? If his hands were so disfigured, how was he able to write, drive or BUILD AN EXTENSION on their house?! I could fill this review with inconsistency after inconsistency, but I am sick of this book. I am sick of hearing about it. I am sick of having read it. Some will ask why I read this whole book if I hated it so much. And the answer is that if I was going to be savage about this book, and I was, I wanted to read the whole thing. SOOOOOO, this savage spent the entirety of this book doing this: P.S. Hey Random House Publishing, I will be sending you my deats for a refund for this POS book. You can bet that all the made up shite in this book is going to come out sooner or later.

Ancora una volta la trama ha eclissato lo stile, il cosa annulla il come.”Winter’s Bone – Un gelido inverno”, regia di Debra Granik. 2010.La storia credo sia ormai abbastanza risaputa: famiglia numerosa (curioso come chi scrive commenti vari il numero dei Westover junior, per chi sono cinque, per chi sei – invece sono sette, e questo si aggancia a quanto dirò tra poco) e famiglia disfunzionale – un incrocio tra “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre - Non aprite quella porta” più “Le colline hanno gli occhi” e dall’altra parte “Winter’s Bone – Un gelido inverno”. Se non che, nel caso dei Westover la violenza è diretta all’interno della famiglia stessa, ben più che all’esterno (anche se in casa circolano perfino armi antiaeree, e i vicini di casa portati come esempio di resistenza sono membri del White Power, Fratellanza Ariana).I figli non vengono registrati all’anagrafe, niente certificato di nascita, vengono convinti o forzati a mollare la scuola, o non frequentarla del tutto, a stare alla larga da medici e ospedali. Il tutto giustificato da una religione (mormone) che non sta in piedi neppure un istante: quale dio richiederebbe e/o approverebbe simili livelli di bestialità umana?!Poi, il tutto si giustifica invece col bipolarismo paterno.La più piccola di casa, Tara, è un magnifico esempio di resilienza, fiore nella concimaia che si redime e salva andando al college (approda addirittura a Cambridge e Harvard), studiando, educandosi, imparando. Un magnifico messaggio di speranza, che è bello raccogliere e far proprio.Una parte della famiglia Westover (quella vera).Ma all’ombra di questo splendido assunto si nasconde una scrittura senza sorprese, né bella né brutta, accessibile e piana, che per fortuna si tiene lontana dalle frasi memorabili e/o a effetto, ma affastella più che incidere.Soprattutto si nasconde un libro notevolmente disarticolato, oserei dire sgangherato. Senza ritmo. E senza una qualche struttura, magari anche ondivaga o contorta. Accelerazioni improvvise sono seguite da brusche frenate, scatti e salti anticipano passi indietro. Non parlo solo dei salti temporali, a quelli siamo abituati, quelli vanno più che bene: a me sembra che la giovane Westover avesse o molta fretta di sfogarsi, o cognizione di una fine da raggiungere in qualsiasi modo. Affronta ogni argomento, dalla descrizione della montagna alle violenze domestiche, con lo stesso identico tono, finendo, ovviamente, col piallare ogni cosa.Ho avuto spesso la sensazione di quegli scarabocchi che si schizzano mentre siamo al telefono o in riunione, e quindi, quando la nostra attenzione è altrove, e la mano gira e rigira, incide, rimane sullo stesso punto, e alla fine vattelapesca cosa volevamo disegnare, è solo un garbuglio di linee.Ho avuto spesso la sensazione di quei film dove uno viene pestato e ne esce con la gamba sinistra zoppicante e un brutto livido sullo stesso braccio – nella scena seguente, però, zoppica dalla destra, e il livido è sulla guancia invece che sul braccio.Il giardino di casa Westover. Back or front yard?Il primo esempio che mi viene in mente è la vicenda materna: dopo il primo incidente d’auto, subisce un’emorragia cerebrale, vive al buio con occhi diventati come quelli di un panda, ha emicranie, non prende medicine, solo erbe, dato l'impedimento religioso, si ha la netta sensazione che sia un processo irreversibile, molto probabilmente destinata a morte prematura… E invece non si sa dove, né come, né quando la madre torna in piena efficienza (fino al punto di poter subire un secondo incidente d’auto). E così avanti per tutto il libro. È stato notato da più parti che il livello di credibilità di quanto raccontato da Westover non soddisfa appieno.378 pagine che a me sono sembrate 3.780. Se non addirittura 37.800.Ma siccome il benedetto messaggio, o contenuto, è di quelli belli belli – ma siccome nella confusione qualche momento buono ci scappa, io tre stelle con qualche esitazione alla fine gliele do.Anche se ora, per giusto bilanciamento, la tentazione è andare a mettere la quinta a Elena Greco. E altrettante a Lila. Le mie amiche geniali.Idaho"

 “My life was narrated for me by others. Their voices were forceful, emphatic, absolute. It had never occurred to me that my voice might be as strong as theirs.” 

The above sentences have the entire essence of this book. This is Tara Westover's story, a home-schooled woman who struggled against all the hardships and got admission to the universities like Harvard and Cambridge. This book shows us the actual value of education and how it can change a person's life. This is a must-read book if you love reading memoirs."

Once I started reading the first few pages, I just couldn't stop reading it. Strange for me to say but when non-fiction tends to read this fictional good I am ready to read non-fiction anytime everywhere.Yes, this book seems like a fiction because we are not aware of the fact that such situations exist in real. If it was not for this book, I would have been so blind to such important issues which happen in families struggling with poverty, illiteracy, misguided religious beliefs, family violence and undiagnosed serious mental health conditions.Before I picked up this memoir, I used to believe that it is just about a girl who strived to get education and got successful in achieving that.But I say it is much, much more than that.This book is horrifying at times the way some events were really dark, violent and gruesome.I was on the edge of my seat until I read the back cover of the book.I understand when the author described how she experienced utter helplessness, getting pulled in opposite directions whether to let go of the family ties or to buckle under everything because it's her family. The hardest is when it's your own family that hurts you and you are left feeling all alone in the entire world. I could relate to this book at so many different levels. I am so glad I picked up this book!"

‘my life was narrated for me by others. their voices were forceful, emphatic, absolute. it had never occurred to me that my voice might be as strong as theirs.’
i would generally consider myself to be a reserved person. i dont tend to actively share my thoughts, feelings, beliefs, or opinions. personal things like that, i usually to keep to myself. but after reading this book, it would be a shame to not express, in some form, how important i think education is. this story, this harrowing yet powerful story, only supports how i feel about the necessity for accessible formal education, as well as the importance to have a desire to educate oneself. taras experiences only prove the immense power of education - how education allows us to be able to consciously examine the world and judge/act accordingly, how striving to learn opens doors to possibilities we can scarcely imagine, and how educating ourselves ultimately gives us the strength of having our own voice. and so, i have no reservations for saying that i am of the strong opinion that this raw and contemplative story is one every person should read. *note: i have been told that i can be a negative nancy from time to time. whilst reading this, there were several aspects of taras story that didnt quite add up to me. i believe every reader should have a healthy ounce of skepticism within them, and mine was causing little red flags to pop up here and there. i appreciate the authors candidness about the unreliability of childhood memories. so although i took the extreme nature of the books content with a grain of salt, it did not detract from the overall message of this book - the importance of education - and so i rated based on that. ↠ 4.5 stars"
29,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani,Rating 4 out of 5,"Educated, Tara WestoverTara Westover was 17 the first time she set foot in a classroom. Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her ""head-for-the-hills bag"". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard. Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent. Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home. Educated is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و هفتم ماه ژانویه سال2019میلادیعنوان: دختر تحصیلکرده، یک سرگذشت؛ نویسنده: تارا وستور؛ مترجم هوشمند دهقان؛ تهران نیلوفر‏‫، سال1397؛ در448ص؛ شابک9789644487767؛ موضوع: سرگذشت تارا وستوور، خانواده؛ از نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده21متارا وستور در ماه سپتامبر سال1986میلادی به دنیا آمد؛ او در شهر «آیداهو» از ایالت‌های غربی «آمریکا» زندگی می‌کرد؛ محل زندگی او سرزمین کوه‌ها، جنگل‌ها، و دره‌ های ژرف بود؛ «تارا وستور» زندگیش در سرزمین دوران کودکی‌ خویش را، این‌ چنین توصیف می‌کنند: «من با ضرباهنگ کوهستان بار آمدم، ریتمی که در آن دگرگونی‌ها هیچگاه بنیادی نبود؛ تغییرات کوهستان همیشه دوره‌ ای بود؛ هر صبحگاه، خورشید همیشگی طلوع می‌کرد، از این سوی دره به آنسو می‌غلتید و در پشت کوه پنهان می‌شد؛ برف‌هایی که در زمستان می‌بارید در بهاران آب میشد»؛او در خانه به دنیا آمد؛ تا نه سالگی شناسنامه نداشت؛ �� پیش از هفده سالگی به کلاس درس پا نگذاشت؛ در منزل، نزد مادر درسی خواند، ولی بیشتر اوقاتش صرف کار در حیاط قراضه‌ های پدر، و جا کردن آذوقه در شیشه‌ های مربا شد؛ این همه بدان خاطر بود، که پدر و مادرش در زمرهٔ «مورمون‌»هایی بودند، که خود را برای آخرالزمان آماده می‌ساختند، و نسبت به آموزش دولتی، امور طبی، و بیمارستان، و پلیس فدرال، بدگمان بودند؛ «تارا» در کنار کوه «باک» و در دنیای کوچکی میبالد، که عقاید بیمارگونهٔ پدر، سخت بر آن سایه افکنده است؛ رفته رفته، اما ذهن «تارا»، دست به خودکاوی می‌زند، و عطش دانش، در او بیدار می‌شود، و خانه و خانواده را، به هوای تحصیل ترک می‌گوید…؛ «تارا» سر از جایی درمی‌آورد، که به خواب هم نمی‌دید؛ این کتاب ماجرای همین سرگذشت دلنشین، و پرفراز و فرود است؛ کتابی که بلافاصله ایشان را، شهره ساخت، و به گفته ی بسیاری، از جمله ویراستاران «آمازون»، «نیویورک‌ تایمز»، «باراک اوباما»، «بیل گیتس» و…؛ در ردیف بهترین آثار سال2018میلادی قرار داردنقل از متن کتاب: (حساب بانکی‌ام مدام آب می‌رفت؛ ترس برم داشته بود، که مبادا نتوانم واحدهایم را پاس کنم، ولی یک ماه مانده به پایان نیمسال، بعد از پرداخت شهریه، اجاره خانه، و خرید خوراکی و کتاب، کم کم این فکر به سرم زد، که حتی اگر واحدهایم را پاس کنم، به خاطر یک دلیل مشخص به دانشگاه باز نخواهم گشت: نمی‌توانستم از پس مخارجش بربیایم؛ در اینترنت شرایط احراز بورس تحصیلی را پیدا کردم؛ معافیت از شهریه، مستلزم آوردن معدل تقریبا کامل بود؛ هنوز یک ماه تا پایان نیمسال فرصت داشتم، با وجود این می‌دانستم بورسیه شدن، به طرز مضحکی، دور از دسترس است؛ تاریخ آمریکا داشت برایم آسان‌تر می‌شد، منتها فقط به این معنا که دیگر تمام امتحانات ماهانه‌ ام را خراب نمی‌کردم؛ عملکردم در درس تئوری موسیقی خوب بود ولی در انگلیسی دست و پا می‌زدم؛ معلم زبانم گفت که در نوشتن استعداد دارم، ولی زبان نگارشم به طرز نامانوسی رسمی، و قلمبه سلمبه است؛ به او نگفتم نوشتن و خواندن را، از طریق خواندن کتاب مقدس مورمون، و خطابه‌ های «جوزف اسمیت» و «بریگم یانگ» آموخته‌ ام؛ گرچه مصیبت اصلیم درس تمدن غرب بود؛ درس گفتارهایش برایم ثقیل بود، شاید بدین خاطر که تا اواخر ژانویه فکر می‌کردم اروپا یک کشور است، و نه یک قاره، و در نتیجه بیشتر حرف‌های استاد برایم نامفهوم بود؛ تازه بعد از سئوالی که در مورد هولوکاست پرسیده بودم، دیگر جرات نداشتم برای روشن شدن ذهنم سئوال کنم؛ با این وصف، به خاطر وجود ونسا، تمدن غرب، کلاس مورد علاقه‌ ام بود؛ از او خوشم می‌آمد، چون شیوه ی «مورمون» بودنش مثل خودم بود: لباس یقه اسکی و گشاد می‌پوشید، و به من گفته بود هیچ‌وقت کوکاکولا نمی‌نوشد، و یک‌شنبه‌ها تکالیفش را انجام نمی‌دهد؛ در دانشگاه ونسا تنها کسی بود که مثل کافرها به نظر نمی‌رسید!)؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 08/10/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 27/08/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"
30,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17692462-amanda,Rating 1 out of 5,"Tara Westover is capable of crafting a beautiful sentence. Her overall story left me processing mixed reaction. It's impressive that although she was ""uneducated"" until she attended BYU at age 17, she continued to such high levels, receiving scholarships and fellowships to study at Cambridge and Harvard, earning her PhD. At the same time, I felt shadows of skepticism. It's her mother's word against hers; one says she is a home schooler, one says she wasn't home schooled - but she somehow learned enough in her years at home to score well above average on the ACT. Rather than having much to do with her education process, the rest of Westover's struggles (family, relationships, and replaying dramatic childhood memories) seem to be her focus. And though a vicious cycle, they are probably not that uncommon, and compared to many childhoods, not even so very bad. (suggested reads: Antwone Fisher's Finding Fish and Kenny Porpora's The Autumn Balloon)Radical parents, I think so. Sometimes dangerous working conditions, yes. Emotionally unhealthy, it sounds that way from Tara's side of things. But she also had opportunity, two sets of grandparents close by and willing to help her, freedoms to break free. I believe her parents helped her with much more than she lets on. The vehicles and money and rent to get to Utah came from somewhere. Not everyone has those resources. I feel strongly that an education is something every child should have a right to, and I'm not attempting to understate the abusive treatment from her brother - though this continued long after she had the means to stay away and became hard for me to sympathize with. Nor am I attempting to understate the working safety hazards. But I've known many people who grew up helping with their family livelihood (building, logging, farming), operating machinery, losing fingers and thumbs - without bitterness or self pity. When I start to think of all of the accidents and injuries accumulated in my own rural upbringing before the 21st century, I realized I could write my own book. (Don't worry, I don't plan on it.) There are a lot of radical religious and political views out there. Unfairly, a lot of not-great parents. And sadly, but above all, far worse neglectful and abusive situations. Mormons are known to be industrious people. What 'Gene' takes to the extreme is his reckless endangerment in trusting ""God and His Angels"" to protect them when doing dangerous work, work people do every day in my neighborhood and all around the world. That's pretty extreme religious faith. Expecting the kids to pitch in on the family business is not so extreme. These are the beehive people who work and toil together. It reaches deep into their values. Tara was also not chained to home. She leaves, going to the local theater, going on dates with a public school boy, leaving with him in a vehicle alone (I was surprised by this!), she works for outsiders away from her home. This was not an isolated or imprisoned upbringing, or even -speaking from experience- a particularly strict one. A common misconception seems to be that Tara Westover grew up in poverty. I never got that impression at any point. She never, ever lacked food, warmth, or a solid roof over her head. The equipment she speaks of -heavy equipment, backhoes- these are very costly things. Dance, singing lessons, pianos - these are not part of an impoverished upbringing. Her father stock piled silver and buried tanks of fuel. Cars and funds always appear when she needs them. (In all fairness, I don't think she was trying to give that impression, some people just made that wrong association. I gather that her family has been pretty successful.)Poverty and radicalism are very different things. Many children in our world go without every single day. Tara did not. The women's subjection was repulsive. But what better fortune to fall into when you have family that frightens you so, than to be handed the opportunity to go live on a prestigious campus on another continent?! It's likely telling of some psychological dependency that she kept going back, years and years into her worldly education, but I didn't get why she kept doing it, and also couldn't help but wonder how this was funded. Tara Westover was not your typical struggling college student, working to make ends meet. Things seem to come to her increasingly easily and without explanation as she becomes a world jet setter. The book lost all beauty for me when I realized it was an account of family drama. Paraphrased emails and letters, he said/she said. Flying home, flying home, constantly returning to the things she's trying to convince us were terrible! Many, many people have had family drama in their life, and I don't feel that part of her story merits a book. It became repetitive, bitter, even petty at times. I felt she was trying too hard to convince me as a reader how bad her family is. Her education process is what I was interested in - that she was in the dark about so much (especially socially and historically), yet continued to high levels. But that experience is mostly glossed over. The majority of the book is about family members, her need to expose everything she could about them, and her lengthy saga to let go. I found myself at odds with her, thinking, ""wise up already and stay away! Start learning from the world around you! Seize these incredible opportunities!"" I also found myself relating to her at times: ""Separation has brought me peace."" But that was a single sentence in a very brief conclusion, and I didn't get the feeling from her book that she really is at peace. That, I think, is the biggest flaw of the book for me. I don't think Tara Westover has reached a healthy place to tell her story from, in a way that rises above and inspires. I've seen Educated compared to The Glass Castle. I loved The Glass Castle . The thing that set it apart for me was the spirit that I find missing here. Jeanette Walls had a resilient, buoyant spirit, resourceful, and never bitter or resentful. Here, I feel as if I have stepped into the middle of an ugly family feud. Tara may have finally separated herself, but this book feels like she's still waging battle - her internal struggle continues, and that's not a healthy place to write a book from.Her parents and bully brother may have it coming, but, for example, 'Shawn's' wife and small children are now victims of having details of their personal lives exploited on the national best seller list. The victim took on the role of victimizer. That doesn't inspire me.Westover, despite her childhood account, had so incredibly much privilege and opportunity that others could work or dream a lifetime for and never see. There was no real gratitude or recognition of that. It crossed my mind that maybe she was so sheltered / naive that she doesn't realize how fortunate she is in the higher education she received. And that maybe she doesn't realize how abused and neglected and impoverished some children grow up. Tara's story became one of immense privilege. The lack of any gratitude for her opportunities and those who helped her to this privileged life she's now living, translated to a lack of grace and left me feeling a disconnect. I feel she was in a rush to write her memoir for spiteful reasons, when she might gain from spending more time learning from the world now that she's conquered the classroom. I believe she still has a lot of important things to learn.Tara Westover has every right to tell her story. The trouble was, I didn't feel she did a thorough job of that. What / Who has she become? what is she going to do with her education? What kind of life is she leading? In the end I have no idea what she is going to do with her educated self! Key ingredient to any inspiring memoir!Instead she focused on telling other peoples stories, and it felt a little toxic. I believe in fairness and truth, and there is no way for me to know what I just read. From her brother Tyler's intelligent and tactful review: ""In her book, in numerous places, Tara interprets for me and other members of my family things that we did, said, thought, and even felt. I cannot speak for the other members of my family, but in my case I think in many instances she greatly incorrectly conveyed my experiences."" Rather than a book about education, this felt like reading a one side of a tell-all family drama. It left a bitter aftertaste. It didn't win me over. The more consideration I give it, the less satisfied I've become.I highly recommend Liz Murray's Breaking Night: A Memoir of Forgiveness, Survival, and My Journey from Homeless to Harvard. It's an amazing memoir. Cea Person's North of Normal: A Memoir of My Wilderness Childhood, My Unusual Family, and How I Survived Both is another good read."

I’m such a blabbermouth! Feel free to skip sections. I went way overboard. Geez….]Tara did a lot more than ride a pogo stick to get from a junkyard in Idaho to a Ph.D. in Cambridge.Meanwhile, I’m bouncing on mine, going high and far to escape her whacked-out father and super-scary psycho brother. Plus, face it, I bring out the pogo stick when it’s a fantastic read and believe me, this qualifies. Holy moly what a tough and bizarro life this amazing woman has had, and oh what a writer!She looks normal, whatever that means.I was so jazzed after reading this book, I went online and watched every interview with Tara that I could find (and there are many; I’ve added a few at the end of this review). I just had to see and hear this woman, this woman who had a strange, horrendous, and dangerous childhood and lived to tell about it—and so eloquently. She’s only in her 20s—so young to be so successful. From the interviews, I see that she happens to be articulate, quick-witted, and confident, and she totally passes for normal, whatever that is. On the outside, you don’t see the scars, the scars that have to exist on her psyche after the hellacious childhood she endured.Spare me the scenery, I want the juice!I didn’t love this book for the first half hour or so of reading; I thought I was in deep do-do. Again, it’s that damn description—which just isn’t my style. The book opens with Tara describing the beauteous mountain that she grew up on. It was perfectly written; a creative writing teacher would have been damn proud of her. But I was screaming inside, “This is a memoir! Tell your story!! Give me some juice! Tell me what happened and how you feel. Save the mountain business for a poem, will you please?” Ha, the mountain was affecting me too—I didn’t like it because it was this giant barricade blocking me from feeling anything about this writer or her story. Luckily, the mountain talk stopped and then I got pulled in real fast. And as I got into the story and forgave her for her brief stint with DD (description disorder, which some writers are afflicted with), I have to admit I sort of liked that she described the mountain and her love for it. The mountain gave her some feeling of safety and peace, and its beauty stayed with her as she trekked to places far away to get her education. Refraining from spilling all the beans.I could sit here and write a Cliffs Notes version of her life, just because I’m so excited to share it, but I’ll try to put a sock in it (one of the two that were knocked off my feet by the power of this story) because you really need to experience this book all for yourself.Dad buried gas and guns.Tara is the youngest of seven kids, all raised in the mountains of Idaho by a madman father who was a religious fanatic and believed the end of the world was coming. He buried gas and guns so that they could survive after the end came. He thought the government, schools, and medicine were all bull—and dangerous. It was all about God’s will and Satan’s grip. He was charismatic and forceful. Although Tara doesn’t think of it as a cult, it sure seemed like a family cult to me, with her dad as the far-out leader. He brainwashed all of them. She says she’ll always have to stop and question whether what he said was true.They are Mormons, but the type of religion is beside the point. Dad is an extremist, that’s all we need to know. Tara says right up front that the book is not about Mormons. I absolutely hate religious rantings, but luckily no one is pushing the religion; Tara is just telling us what it was like around her house. Tara doesn’t talk about her religious beliefs today; I’m mildly curious. At the time, she believed everything he said.The state didn’t know Tara existed.Tara doesn’t have a birth certificate and doesn’t know her birthday--just an approximation. How weird would that be? She was born at home and her father didn’t register her existence because he didn’t want the government to make her go to school. When she is seven, she says: “…When I am nine, I will be issued a Delayed Certificate of Birth, but at this moment, according to the state of Idaho and the federal government, I do not exist.”Burns and gashes and raccoon eyes.I will say that this memoir reads like fiction. It’s hard to believe that it’s not. Expect to bite your lip and grimace and scream inside as you read detailed descriptions of MANY accidents that happened to Tara and her family members. Burns and gashes and raccoon eyes and brains hitting concrete. Some people say that she probably misremembered or exaggerated, but I say you don’t make up seeing your brother’s brain peeking out of his skull. How did they all stay alive?Psycho bro.And then there’s the mental and physical torture that her psycho brother Shawn inflicted on Tara and others. Oh, he’s a cutie all right. He broke her fingers, put her head in the toilet—normal stuff like that. If there was ever a need for a therapist….Doesn’t every kid risk their life working in a junkyard?Tara doesn’t play the victim. And she doesn’t hate her family—which at first seems hard to believe. But she says her life seemed normal to her: she had nothing to compare it to, for one. All kids must help their fathers work; her dad just happened to own a junkyard with dangerous equipment. How could she know that other families didn’t get injured all the time? How did she know that other families went to hospitals instead of using herbs to cure everything? (Her mom is an accomplished herbalist.) And she knew her parents loved her and meant well. Dad couldn’t help it that he was crazy. He did the best he could. So despite growing up in this intense, isolated family with a mad father, an abusive brother, horrific accidents, and a fear of the apocalypse, she doesn’t think she had a terrible childhood-- and she has many good memories. Wow.Isn’t Europe a country?Her formal education began when she was 17 when, after studying on her own for the ACT exams, she got into Brigham Young University. Before this, she had never stepped foot in a classroom. She had never heard of the Holocaust or the civil rights movement. She thought Europe was a country. She didn’t think to read her textbooks; she thought she was supposed to just look at the pictures. Despite this, she ended up at Cambridge. She says getting an education is not about making money, but about making a person. Hell-bent on getting educated.I identify with her being hell-bent on getting educated and knowing she had to do it herself. My parents wouldn’t send me to college (they wanted me to be a flight attendant, but they did worry I was too short). I had an intense drive to go to college. I went to the library to find out which city had the most colleges and that was Boston, with 58 of them! When I was 18, I moved there, determined to get accepted into one that I could afford (I did.) But wait, I must stick to Tara’s story. I just wanted to say that I identified with her drive and her success in getting through college. (Ha, I wasn’t anywhere near as smart as her; I certainly didn’t end up at Cambridge University!)Her education (for her, an awakening) included taking psych courses. She realized then that her dad was probably mentally ill, and this knowledge allowed her to forgive him. He couldn’t help being scary, controlling, and fanatical. And he didn’t purposely put her in harm’s way in the junkyard; he just didn’t have the ability to see danger. Psych classes also helped her become super self-aware. I loved the parts in the book where she analyzes herself. One thing she talked about was gaslighting—the process of people denying your reality and making you feel crazy. For example, this happened when she tried to tell her parents what her psycho brother had done to her. Although her mom first believed her, she soon changed her tune and sided with Tara’s father, denying that such bad things happened. Tara says she started doubting her sanity—which has to be scary. She says she had a breakdown at one point. Not surprising.Run, Tara, run! The only frustrating thing about her book is watching her return, time and time again, to visit her family. Quick, Tara, jump on my back as we pogo-stick on out of there! NOW! Psycho, sadistic bro Shawn is just too damn scary! He cranked it up a notch every time she visited, and I was scared he would seriously mess her up—break a bigger bone, give her brain damage, throw her off the mountain, something really bad. Part of her need to return was to win her family’s approval (and Shawn just happened to live there too, so there was no escaping him). But she also wanted to expose Shawn and to warn them about him, since he was attacking other people too. Plus, people who live together a long time get imprinted on each other. We can’t underrate how much the existence of a history ties people together. I think the only way she would have severed ties would be if there had been sexual abuse. The skeptics.Some critics doubt whether her story is true, or they think it’s exaggerated. She admits that we can’t always believe our memories, that they are tricky. To try to make her story as accurate as possible, she looked back through her journals. Usually journals are full of fact, not fiction, so I believe it’s a good source for her truth. Also, a couple of her brothers have corroborated her memories. I don’t think she made this stuff up. I’m not sure you can make this stuff up, especially the level of detail she gave for injuries and reactions to injuries. I buy her story—hook, line, and sinker.Her interviews are factual, analytical. In fact, she’s a little stoical. She seems to have intellectualized her trauma, which is a common defense mechanism. I’m probably just full of it, but I’m thinking that if she were a storyteller who wants to wow her audience with a wild story, she’d appear more animated, less analytical. She’d want to dwell on the juice, which she doesn’t do. In the longer interviews, she discusses her philosophy on education—not the kind of stuff that makes an audience wriggle in glee. I think of her as a reporter—she reports on the madness but she also reports on the scenery (remember the mountain talk that I didn’t love at first). She isn’t interested in creating fiction.Airing dirty laundry.There are a few scathing 1-star reviews on Amazon by family members and friends of the family. They say that most of what Tara says isn’t true, that the family is wonderful and not so isolated, that Tara’s dad helped fund her college. Tara even says in her book that he helped her out financially. He didn’t want her to go to college, but he didn’t prevent it either. These negative reviews say that Tara is unstable (let me say that in interviews, she does not in any way appear or sound weird). Of course they would say that. What self-respecting family wouldn’t be pissed at someone airing their dirty laundry? And again, it’s that memory thing. Put a bunch of siblings in a room and ask them about something that happened in their childhood, and they’ll all have a different memory of it. Plus there’s the truth that every sibling has a unique relationship and experience with their parents and with each other. At this point, most of Tara’s family (parents and a few sibs) have shunned her. I’m sure that not having her family’s support is killing her; a family has such power over you. No one wants their family to shun them. Luckily, she is close to a couple of brothers. In the book, she gives them credit for helping her.It’s not a woman, it’s a pencil!Now for some silly cover talk. For the longest time, I thought this was an artsy cover showing the back of a woman. She has this little head with long dark hair, and she’s wearing a red skirt that’s way bigger than her head. Then, what? OMG, it’s not a woman, it’s a pencil!! Very clever! Days pass before I see that there’s a little person standing on the pencil! It’s supposed to look like a girl standing on a mountain side, like Tara and her mountain. Wow! What an enticing and cool cover. Check out her interviews:Here are a few of the interviews I liked.

33,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9472704-linda,Rating 4 out of 5,"I must tell you.......Educated: A Memoir scalded the very edges of my soul. It took me through a whole gamut of my own emotions from belief to disbelief, from hesitation to doubt to wariness, and most importantly, from the weightiness of compassion and empathy to the restrictions of frustration and anger.Tara Westover tells her story straight out through the reflections seen by her own eyes, her own jagged experiences, and in her own words. As you step inside of Tara's story you will certainly have moments in which vexation will sit down right next to you and shake its head in disbelief and sorrow. Truth comes in variations of light.We live in a world in which we sift life experiences of our own and others through an internal grid. Does it shake out right in our minds? Can we relate to any of this? Or do we see the world through tunnel vision? Our experiential backgrounds, existing in the light of positivity or in the deepest caves of darkness, form the prism for which we view life. We form our values and codes of conduct normally through trial and error. We receive feedback and reinforcement, ideally, through our family unit. Tara's self-expressed reality is a reality for more individuals in some way, shape or form that we can even begin to image.There is no sugar-coating this story. Be prepared for that. Gene Westover is a self-proclaimed prophet of impending doom. His social revolutionary nature and his transfixion with his skewed religious beliefs bled into this family with dire emotional and physical consequences. His children seemed to be no more than members of a work crew who were manipulated and mind-controlled in his demands for loyalty at all costs.Faye, the mother, left a ""normally functioning"" childhood home only to be squelched under the thumb of a very sick man. She had that internal grid of right and wrong within her, initially, and buckled under to his demands at the price of her own children's well-being. No salve, no herb, no tincture can cure that, dear woman.We, as readers, watch the slow, painful motions of Tara trying to break free from this toxic environment. I rallied behind her in her transition. But I mourned her inability to warn Emily of the nightmare that she was encountering in the likes of her demented brother, Shawn, before they married. I also mourned Tara's constant returning to the seen of the crime, almost like a battered wife syndrome, seeking approval and acceptance.......seeking to be re-engaged with this dysfunctional tribe. Gene and Shawn poisoned this well.While I celebrate Tara's eventual life achievements, I know in my heart that she will always be broken inside from the entrapment she lived through and continues to live through. ""Nothing touches me"" are her own words. It is most difficult to bloom in life when your very thoughts are suffocated before they can even find a voice. It is my sincere hope that Tara's words, truth-bound or not, will reach into that darkness that exists in others right now in order for them to find their own voice. Breaking free seems like the weight of granite tied to one's ankles. Difficult, but not impossible ""if only"" the someone, somewhere were more vigilant to the plight of our neighbors. We, as a society, are so observant and wise after the fact. Seeing eyes that blur into blindness.I received a copy of this book through NetGalley for an honest review.

37,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford,Rating 5 out of 5,"That Cool Mountain AirTara Westover In Education tells a tale remarkably like that of Jeanette Walls in The Glass Castle (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...) - of incompetent parents, child endangerment, and not infrequent life-threatening physical injury. Both women survive and thrive sufficiently to write about their experiences with some considerable elegance and wit. But while the psychological traumas of each woman are similar, the sociological sources of their experiences are radically different. Walls was merely neglected; Westover was actively persecuted. Walls suffered the consequences of random haplessness; Westover was subject to systematic oppression with an historical pedigree. And that history is not irrelevant to understanding her story and her achievement.After buying the land West of the Mississippi from Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson sent an expedition to find out what was there. What they found was a native culture, in fact many cultures, but all without a civilisation. The aboriginal inhabitants flowed with the seasons up and down the Plains and up and down the mountains. With no fixed place of abode, they were perfectly adapted to their environment. These native groups were not only independent, they were ungoverned, at least according to European standards - traditions not constitutions ruled; communication was verbal not written; there were few specialised institutions aside from the designation of sexual roles; and, crucially, there were few permanent encampments much less cities. Several members of the expeditionary party, intrigued by this mode of living, decided to stay and became the first legendary mountain men. Of those who returned from this early nineteenth century equivalent of the far side of the moon, at least one committed suicide upon his re-entry to American civilisation, primitive as it was at the time.About 40 years later, that most American of all American religious groups, the Mormons, wandered across the Mississippi after causing a bit of a ruckus in New York State, Ohio and Illinois (See: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...). They brought with them some highly innovative home-grown theology which placed the original Garden of Eden square in the middle of Missouri (conveniently right at a crossroads laid out by the Geodetic Survey; it’s easily recognisable because it has churches of various Mormon sects on each corner). Some unsavoury things happened there as well.Given their domestic habits, particularly polygamy, the Mormons became, at least for a time, a culture without a civilisation, wandering without clear intention further and further West. Eventually they settled by the Great Salt Lake; but the fascination of a culture without a civilisation persisted in many, who until today still seek out such an existence in the remote mountains from Arizona to Idaho.That these folk who maintain a phobia about civilisation might suffer from a genetic defect, or are bewitched by cultic beliefs, or are undergoing some form of induced mass-hysteria is open to debate. Perhaps they are living examples of the Freudian theory of conflict between the individual and civilisation. What is more certain is that they impose some very strange and often terrifying ways of living on their families, particularly on their children. These people have not merely adopted a ‘life-style’ in the manner of 60’s hippies - like Jeanette Walls’s family - trying merely to ‘drop-out’ of a particular pattern of living. They pray for the destruction of all social institutions and for the coming of divine judgment. And they literally arm themselves and stock their larders for the violent struggle they believe will ensue from that judgment.Some, like Westover’s parents, reject any form of civil government whatsoever. Their explicit enemy is civilisation itself - its administrative organisation, its legal obligations, its educational systems and, most dramatically, its police powers which they consider satanic. They live in a mythological world of self-sufficiency and imminent apocalypse. Their goal is to remain ‘off grid’ except to the extent that they can undermine existing social structures. So no birth registration, no driver’s license, no insurance, no draft or social security card unless compelled by circumstances, and even then with subversive intent.Not all Mormons are uncivilised in this sense but some certainly are. In any case, the extreme Gnosticism which they profess is not inconsistent with Mormon doctrine. And their participation, however desultory, in the Mormon Church itself is cultural rather than institutional. That participation is important for sustaining such militant sociopathy. The Church is the only connection to the rest of humanity that is tolerated among them - I suspect because membership in it, a Church many do not recognise as properly Christian, is a subliminal poke at the ‘civilised’ religions in the rest of America. Even then, individual members and the Church as a whole may be considered suspect because of their acquiescence to governmental authority. Nevertheless, the Church plays a critical role in this strange individualist cult of the American West: keeping this unique culture intact and civilisation at bay. As Westover quotes her father: “God couldn’t abide faithlessness.” Included in this Mormon-inspired anathema is everything from mathematics to health care. Therefore it is not surprising that Westover seems to find the break from her past more difficult than Walls. The fact that either one of them survived is near-miraculous. But that Westover still has the psychic strength to write about it seems a far way beyond the miraculous to me."

I really struggled with how to write this one. I read Educated with a group of my Traveling Sisters and for the most part, we all struggled with parts of this book but for this review, I am going to stick to my thoughts.I mostly struggled with how the book was written and I didn’t feel it was written with compassion and emotion. I didn’t connect with Tara Westover because it felt very one-sided to me and I didn’t feel like we were told the whole story. I felt like she was only telling us the side she wanted us to know. For that reason, I struggled with the credibility of this story. I really wanted to connect with Tara Westover and understand her journey and be inspired by her achievements but for the most part, it felt forced on me to feel for her instead of being inspired by her achievements. Many people overcome heartbreaking odds and have inspiring stories to tell, Tara Westover’s story just didn’t feel that way for me.

Tara grows up in a different kind of family. Her dad knows that the end of the world is coming and makes sure his family is always ready. He has them preparing food constantly, digs a shelter, does not believe in association with anything government (including doctors)...mom is a midwife that practices with herbal cures. The family has strong beliefs that center them on their mountain and away from worldly things. Including school. Technically, the story is that the family is homeschooled...but there is not a whole lot of schooling going on. Unless you count working the family junkyard. (That might get you killed.)The family for the most part is okay with all this because of the simple fact that they just don't know anything else. Their dad is a force and his beliefs are held strong in the family. Tara had never heard of the Holocaust until she was almost an adult.Tara decides she has to escape from some of her family pressures unless she wants to end up pregnant and following her meek mothers footsteps. Plus, she has an older brother that is so abusive that he turned my stomach.So why didn't I fall all in love with this book? For me it repeated itself so much that I didn't think the story was ever going to move on. Some parts were just mind bogglingly boring and I almost threw it aside. But then there were parts after the first half of the book that I couldn't read fast enough. Go figure. Booksource: Netgalley in exchange for review."

My dental hygienist even wrote it down because she asked me for a good book recommendation. She likes biographies. YASSSSSSSSS! I'M READING THE BEST MEMOIR EVER!!! YOU MUST BUY IT TODAY!!! (That was in between spitting and rinsing, of course.) I love memoirs written by unusual people. Tara Westover is not only highly educated, but she is stubborn as a bulldog and pulled herself up by the steel-toed boots she wore as a child working in her family's Idaho junkyard. The first class room she ever entered was the first day of her freshman college year at age 17. She had never seen a doctor. Never had a vaccination. Never taken even an ibuprofen. She had no birth certificate. She didn't even know her birthday. She didn't know she was supposed to wash her hands after using the restroom. She had never heard of the civil rights movement or the Holocaust. Yet, despite these odds, she rose to the position of earning her Ph.D from the prestigious Cambridge University. Can you imagine the extremeness of dangerous and rural, poverty-stricken Idaho when compared to Cambridge? If you are familiar with the grand dining hall of Harry Potter's Hogwarts, you have an idea of the scale and beauty of such a hallowed site of academia. Talk about a fish out of water story. I love it!At the heart of her memoir lies Tara's unrelenting drive to be accepted by her family despite her eventual success with higher education and her rebirth into a different world altogether. She valiantly tries to stop the cycle of violence that involves her older brother. Her father was stirred by his own religious beliefs, but his mental illness was what propelled their family into doomsday mode. He was a devout survivalist and determined to take his entire family with him into the darkness.EDUCATED is a fascinating story of sheer perseverance and grit. I listened to the audiobook and it was a phenomenal production. Heartbreaking at times, but it is an ultimately uplifting and inspiring story."

Educated
 is at times difficult to read and not at all what I expected, but I couldn't tear myself away from it.""Mother had always said we could go to school if we wanted. We just had to ask Dad, she said. Then we could go. But I didn't ask. There was something in the hard line of my father's face, in the quiet sigh of supplication he made every morning before he began family prayer, that made me think my curiosity was an obscenity, an affront to all he'd sacrificed to raise me.""Until she was 17 years old, Tara Westover never went to school. Her father was convinced that the government was out to get them in every way, so his children got their education at home—not through books and studying, but through preparing for the End of Days by making survivalist kits, canning endless jars of fruit, and being prepared for a siege at any time.Tara's mother was a midwife and healer, so she helped her mother prepare the various tinctures and remedies she used. At other times she worked in her father's junkyard with her siblings, salvaging scrap metal and dealing with the various injuries that came with this work, because her parents didn't believe that doctors or hospitals could heal better than herbs and the Lord's power. The problem was, they were so isolated that there was no one to help ensure the children learned any actual facts, or protect them when behavior turned violent.When one of Tara's older brother's left the family compound in Idaho to study at Brigham Young University, for the first time Tara realized there was a world outside her father's blustery preaching. Despite having never set foot in a classroom, she began to study for the ACT exam, teaching herself enough math, grammar, and science to achieve the score she needed to attend BYU herself. But this decision didn't please her father, who believed college professors were liars and hypocrites sure to take Tara down a blasphemous path.In 
Educated
, Westover shares her story about being caught between loyalty to family and God, and the desire to find your own way, to learn things on your own. She touches on learning about things like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement for the first time, and how difficult she found being on her own, dealing with the disapproval of her father.While this book deals with the educational triumphs Westover ultimately achieves despite all of the obstacles thrown in her way, this is a tough story to read as well, because she also shares what it is like to constantly have your self-worth undermined by those who claim to love you and want what's best for you. How can you ever truly believe you deserve a life in which you don't have to worry about abuse, humiliation, and degradation, when it is your own family causing these things? Where do you find the strength to say you've had enough when you know doing so might cost you your family?I'm late to the party in reading this, and I will admit this wasn't quite the book I expected, as I thought it would focus more on Westover's education than her upbringing and the emotional and physical abuse she endured for years. Obviously, this, too, was part of her education, but at times I found the continuous pattern of behaviors really difficult to keep reading about. I realize that those around her must have felt the same way—just when they thought she might be making a breakthrough she let the same things happen to her over and over and over again.Even though this wasn't an enjoyable book per se, it was written so skillfully, and Westover's story was so compelling that I read the entire book in a day thanks to a flight and a long car ride.This is an important, poignant, thought-provoking book which demonstrates how one woman found the courage to achieve despite being surrounded by those who told her she shouldn't or she couldn't.

I finished this book well over a week ago and I have sat on this review, because I just am not sure how to be honest without criticizing a persons life.... for this reason I may never read another memoir that I need to review, it is hard for me to separate the person from the book.... but I will try...On a very positive note I thought the message of this book was wonderful education is extremely important.... it really is one thing nobody can ever take away from you.... I do admire Tara’s fortitude to acquire an education..... however there was a little luck involved here.... all I’m saying is the average person of average intelligence probably isn’t going to end up at Harvard.... no matter how hard they work.... clearly Tara was blessed with the intelligence to do so, and this was not addressed anywhere in this book... my father grew up with a single mother, his father passed away when he was one-year-old, they didn’t have much, but his mother forced him to go to at least one year of college and he ended up with a PhD in aeronautical engineering.... now I am very proud of my father he has accomplished a lot in his life and he is an amazing person, however he was also blessed with an amazing brain... apparently this skips a generation because my son was blessed with that same amazing brain.... all I’m saying is sometimes you need to give credit where credit is due.... if I had started college without knowing any algebra my freshman year I would have never made it through college much less ended up at Harvard, no matter how hard I worked..... so yes you should work hard, yes education is important, but you also need to be realistic with what your abilities are.... some of the hardest working people might end up at the local community college or not in college at all..... sorry that was a bit of a rant, rant over....There are also some things in this book I found a little hard to believe.... however I will give Tara the benefit of the doubt on this, sometimes our perception of things isn’t exactly how things happened.... wow a lot of things could have been avoided if they just wore seatbelts....But really in all honesty none of the things stated above cause me to not love this book, it just did not hold my attention.... I needed some light moments in the midst of all these horrible childhood memories.... even in the worst of childhoods there are some bright spots....For me this book had a very positive message, however I would’ve preferred it to be delivered in a more positive and realistic manner.... and to all of you who love this book I am so glad you did! really I wish I had as well....*** thank you to the publisher and Net Galley for a copy of this book ***"

I’m glad I read it - Tara Westover is a talented writer and clearly someone with a tough, determined spirit. The extreme environment she grew up in and her often delusional family were no small feats to overcome! I struggled with this book because I have a hard time believing all of it. When I read the chapter about her brother Luke’s burning leg, Westover’s credibility at least somewhat diminished with the footnote included at the end about how others remember the events of the day playing out. Yes, I know people can and do remember actual events differently. From this point on though, as I continued to read the book, I couldn’t help but wonder when the next discrepancy would occur or how she may be embellishing the scene. Parts of the story were hard to read, particularly the graphic descriptions of gruesome injuries that the Westover family often refused to have professionally, medically treated, as well as the perpetual emotional and physical abuse within the family. It was disappointing to read about the frayed relationship Tara had with her family, though she was much kinder and more forgiving about it than I know I’d ever be - Blood relatives or not. I was pleased to see Westover triumph in difficult situations, time and time again. The resiliency and drive she maintained in order to continue pursuing more is admirable. The high quality of her writing is apparent early on in the book. I’m glad I read Educated but it just did not resonate with me like it appears to have with many other readers."

It was emotional and hard to read at times, but I found myself truly captivated from beginning to end. This book actually reminded me of The Glass Castle in some ways, but this was even more extreme.The biggest takeaway for me is that Tara, even with all the backwardness of her upbringing and the abuse she endured, develops a love for learning and moves on to get a PhD from Cambridge.

I went into this book fairly blind and was not even particularly interested in reading it. I was given an ecopy by a dear friend who insisted that I read this so that we could discuss in an uninhibited and free manner. I very much am looking forward to that evening. Tara Westover is an unreliable narrator and in indirect ways she acknowledges this. This does not take away from her experience but rather intensifies and makes her life story more poignant and powerful. She is both naive and unremarkable as well as courageous and noble. From the get go, she had my respect and my heart ached for her impoverished neglect, physical and emotional abuses as well as exposure to illnesses, witnessing of immense traumas and a lifelong experience of being other whether it be being Mormon Zealotry, lack of schooling, social isolation or lack of nurturance and love. For Ms. Westover and her siblings this was a chronic and unrelenting condition. Ms. Westover veers from side to side in her story, never fully present, dissociated, hurt and forever yearnful of needing her mother's protection and father's acceptance and love. This continues to the present day despite being a respected memoirist and PhD historian. She continues to ache for her family despite being mostly estranged.  As Ms. Westover continues to process and heal and find her own voice and life I hope she continues to share with us her life experiences for there is much to be gleaned. I hope she knows deep in her being that she is admirable, respected and most importantly lovable. Thank you for this book Ms. Westover and this reader wishes you the very best and a much smoother and happier life in the future. "

I usually save my audio books for my car trips, but I found myself listening to this one at home. A story about Tara and her childhood growing up in a Mormon family. Her father was a survivalist and thought the world might end at any moment!Their family home was situated in the shadow of Buck Peak mountain and they lived in poverty. Tara and her six siblings endured much pain under the volatile father and one brother who proved to be quite dangerous. The mother seemed to be in denial and turned the other cheek time and again. Tara never attended school until the age of 17. She endured so much pain growing up with such a demanding and out of touch father. I was shocked at some of the life threatening situations she endured by having to work in her fathers metal scrapping business. The accidents were horrific.Lots of reviews on this one, I thought it was both shocking and uplifting to read how Tara was able to pull herself out of the family chaos and become a successful woman.Thanks to NG for my arc. I was able to read along with the audio."

This is a book about a girl getting over what her family did to her, so she can move on. She never went to school has a kid, and her parents did not really home school her. She work with her Dad at the Junk yard as a young girl. During growing up she is treated really bad and a lot of crazy stuff happens to her while growing up. Then her brother goes to college and she decides she wants to go to college. She start teaching her shelf everything she needed to pass the test. I cannot believe how much this girl self thought herself, but I am glad she overcome what her family did to her and learn what she needed to. I loved this book, but it can be very hard to read. You should look up warnings before starting the books if abuse and things like that in books bothers you. The audiobook is really good I listened to the audiobook for this book. This is one of the best memoir I have read, and if you enjoy memoirs then you should check this one out. Note: This book as a lot of hard to read things, and you should look into them if you get upset by things you read."

53,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6603759-misericordia,Rating 5 out of 5,"Somehow, I feel like the ultimate voyeur, what with this spectacle that the author has been so very kind to provide us all, gawkers, with. It's deliciously angsty and ... fabulously unusual and ... is motivating to keep our minds in healthy state. All the Illuminati and Fed and compulsive muscle testing and tinktures and every other weird ideas her family must have entertained... wow! Brain health isn't anywhere close to being overrated. That this girl basically taught herself everything she needed is an extremely cool skill that is going to be of immence help in her future career. I don't have doubts as to this (or any other!) part of story: it's all in the head and therefore possible. And she's done really well! Still, 'EDUCATION' comes across as a private fetish of sorts.I both love and hate all the 'edu' vibes and hypes. For one thing, I can relate to the love of education and books and ideas, for another, I know full well just how empty of sense and promise and vitality can the public education get. So, the protagonist's need to crawl into the tubes of some public education machine and stay there, is sort of not too impressive. Her turning to self-study, however, is! I really admire people driven to go the extra mile to teach themselves things. Yeah, getting into wherever she got is a big deal. But being able to think autonomously, being out of the system is also a big deal. And you don't learn it in school. So, I would classify it as a blessing in disguise that she got from her situation. The 'we are not like everyone else oh poor different us' vibe was extra strong and irritating. I was like 'So, you're different? Guess what? We all are! Deal with it!' Frankly, I don't think being different is anything to be worried about or to be so worked up about. Being different is not even the issue here. The PTSD after all that prophetic zealotry BS - yes, a big issue. Not wearing a helmet while going around a junkyard - yes, a very big issue. Dad, throwing metal things at his kid just because he FORGOT about her being there - yes, that's a paramount issue. Being homeschooled and living on a mountain - totally fine.Being NOT schooled at all and even dragged from books to water trees in the middle of a rainstorm - a big problem there! I understand that this protagonist probably is depicted as having a very limited expience of our mind-boggling world. But after all the fuss about 'education' the least she could realise is that our world is complex. In it people live in totally hellish places. People manage to make a break not from just Idaho but from lots of horrible God-forgotten places around the world. They get educations based on self-study. They go into high-stress high-power professions and make it high. And, well, many of them make less fuss about it all. Of course, not everyone makes it so it's my pleasure to applaud the protagonist joing the exclusive Survivors' Club. Still, I almost took off a star for this. The ethics is something else. I don't think we've been shown the whole story. Nope. No way. I have no idea what I think about this book ethics-wise. I'm not getting clear vibes about it. What I get is that there's probably a whole lot of hidden stuff we are not shown. Another thing that doesn't mesh well with the forensic part of my soul, is money. It's clear there's no clear structure to the cash flows in here. I'm not seeing our protagonist waiting tables or being some think-tank miracle consultant. Still, she must have lived on some dime, for sure, so where did it come from? Probably from the scholarships and probably she didn't need too much after her growing up experience, right? Still, one can't help wondering... Anyway, even had they been supplementing her with money to study, this does not mean the memoir is untrue or less valid, just that the funding issue wasn't highlighted (which would have been a fair thing to do, if only to help the sceptics to wrap their minds around all of this). This family is very unconventional. It a lot of ways, some of which quite possibly hair-raising. Extremist to the point of barking crazy. All the accidents this family gets... No, it should be ACCIDENTS! One can't help wondering if they hadn't been trying to commmit suicides, fuelled by their unconcious desire to die. Their aversion of safety seems to be a genuine pathology. There seems to be quite a bit of unhealthy psychological practices going on with them and all.They do seem to have unhealthy fascination with religion and privacy. And the milk vs honey debacle made me stare a bit!And they do induldge in their paranoia. All the Fed-fascination, all the guns, all the 'go-to-the mountain' bags... Wow! The parents basically brainwash themselves and their kids into it.Then again, I'm sure there are many people like that out there. Do we absolutely need to life-shame them all? Hopefully, for most of us the answer is no. People with deceases of the mind are already stigmatized horribly in our society, I don't think making it even harder for them is the way to go. The decision to write this book is, admittedly, not steeped in empathy. Like they say, no matter how you raise your kids, they will have what to discuss with their psychoanalyst. It's quite possible that all our kids, spouses, mothers, sisters, all kinds of relatives, have grudges against us. (Though hopefully, none of those grudges are like THIS!) Still, I don't think many of us are saintly enough to be impeccable and without reproach. While we generally aren't scared into hiding by the Illuminati, we all happen to be human: we make mistakes, we fail to admit them, we are wrong, we fall ill, we fail spectacularly at certain things and relations. So let's imagine for a sec just how wonderful (not!) we all might have felt had all our relatives believed it the best use of their time to vent their private frustrations by publishing their memoirs 'with all the subtlety of a bulldozer' about us. I don't think many of us would appreciate such subtlety and the notoriety to go with it. Once again, the privacy. We all need it. And the ill people need it more than most of us. And, we can safely assume, there is a lot of illness between the members of this family. Even Tyler is shown displaying some OCD tendencies. The rest are far off charts.Had the protagonist simply needed to vent it all, she could have told a story about her friend, her class-mate, anyone in the world, change the number of siblings, switch locales and minutia. I'm getting the feeling that it was the intention to make it clear to the world WHO was described in there. I'm not saying this book should not have been written - it totally should have. What I'm trying to get at is that I haven't felt much warmth or kindness or compassion in this story and I feel that's the real tragedy of this set of protagonists. Of course, it's me, it's not the book, not the author, not the protagonists, it's nothing but my personal take on 'Education'.PS. This could have also been a bid to guarantee personal safety, what with all the Shawn threats and everything. We won't know everything, anyway.Still, the book is spectacular! I do hope Tara goes on to become happy and healed.Education, of course:Q:“All that really matters,” she said to me one morning, “is that you kids learn to read. That other twaddle is just brainwashing.” (c)Q:Learning in our family was entirely self-directed: you could learn anything you could teach yourself, after your work was done. Some of us were more disciplined than others. I was one of the least disciplined, so by the time I was ten, the only subject I had studied systematically was Morse code, because Dad insisted that I learn it. “If the lines are cut, we’ll be the only people in the valley who can communicate,” he said, though I was never quite sure, if we were the only people learning it, who we’d be communicating with. (c)Q:The older boys—Tony, Shawn and Tyler—had been raised in a different decade, and it was almost as if they’d had different parents. Their father had never heard of the Weavers; he never talked about the Illuminati. He’d enrolled his three oldest sons in school, and even though he’d pulled them out a few years later, vowing to teach them at home, when Tony had asked to go back, Dad had let him. Tony had stayed in school through high school, although he missed so many days working in the junkyard that he wasn’t able to graduate.Because Tyler was the third son, he barely remembered school and was happy to study at home. Until he turned thirteen. Then, perhaps because Mother was spending all her time teaching Luke to read, Tyler asked Dad if he could enroll in the eighth grade.Tyler stayed in school that whole year, from the fall of 1991 through the spring of 1992. He learned algebra, which felt as natural to his mind as air to his lungs. (c)Q:Tyler’s imagination had been captured. With what money he had he bought an old trigonometry textbook and continued to study on his own. He wanted to learn calculus next but couldn’t afford another book, so he went to the school and asked the math teacher for one. The teacher laughed in his face. “You can’t teach yourself calculus,” he said. “It’s impossible.” Tyler pushed back. “Give me a book, I think I can."" (c)Beliefs:Q: I had grown up preparing for the Days of Abomination, watching for the sun to darken, for the moon to drip as if with blood. I spent my summers bottling peaches and my winters rotating supplies (c)Q:My father was not a tall man but he was able to command a room. He had a presence about him, the solemnity of an oracle. ...There was a divine doctrine here, he said. He would inquire of the Lord. (c)Q:“Butter and honey shall he eat,” Dad droned, low and monotone, weary from a long day hauling scrap. “That he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.” ...The next morning Dad purged our fridge of milk, yogurt and cheese, and that evening when he came home, his truck was loaded with fifty gallons of honey.“Isaiah doesn’t say which is evil, butter or honey,” Dad said, grinning as my brothers lugged the white tubs to the basement. “But if you ask, the Lord will tell you!” (c)Q:God told Dad to share the revelation with the people who lived and farmed in the shadow of Buck’s Peak. On Sundays, nearly everyone gathered at the church, a hickory-colored chapel just off the highway with the small, restrained steeple common to Mormon churches. Dad cornered fathers as they left their pews. He started with his cousin Jim, who listened good-naturedly while Dad waved his Bible and explained the sinfulness of milk. Jim grinned, then clapped Dad on the shoulder and said no righteous God would deprive a man of homemade strawberry ice cream on a hot summer afternoon. (c)Psychological issues:Q:I BECAME OBSESSED WITH bipolar disorder. We were required to write a research paper for Psychology and I chose it as my subject, then used the paper as an excuse to interrogate every neuroscientist and cognitive specialist at the university. I described Dad’s symptoms, attributing them not to my father but to a fictive uncle. Some of the symptoms fit perfectly; others did not. The professors told me that every case is different.“What you’re describing sounds more like schizophrenia,” one said. “Did your uncle ever get treatment?”“No,” I said. “He thinks doctors are part of a Government conspiracy.”“That does complicate things,” he said. (c) Actually, many medical students go through a phase when they diagnose themselves and everyone around with pretty much everythng. It usually passes after a person gets proper medical edu.Q:With all the subtlety of a bulldozer I wrote my paper on the effect bipolar parents have on their children. It was accusative, brutal. I wrote that children of bipolar parents are hit with double risk factors: first, because they are genetically predisposed to mood disorders, and second, because of the stressful environment and poor parenting of parents with such disorders. (c)Q:Dad lived in fear of time. He felt it stalking him. (c)Brainwashing:Q:When the Feds come to Buck’s Peak, we’ll be ready. (c)Q:Mother didn’t want to be a midwife. Midwifery had been Dad’s idea, one of his schemes for self-reliance. (c)Family:Q:“Don’t you teach your children to wash after they use the toilet?” Grandma said.Dad shifted the truck into gear. As it rolled forward he waved and said, “I teach them not to piss on their hands.” (c)A very, ahem, weird take on the medicinal practices and ACCIDENTS (gosh!):Q:Two days later a package arrived, express from Idaho. Inside were six bottles of tincture, two vials of essential oil, and a bag of white clay. I recognized the formulas—the oils and tinctures were to fortify the liver and kidneys, and the clay was a foot soak to draw toxins. There was a note from Mother: These herbs will flush the antibiotics from your system. Please use them for as long as you insist on taking the drugs. Love you. (c)Q:The lower half of his face liquefied: the fire consumed plastic, then skin, then muscle. The same process was repeated with his fingers... Rescue Remedy—the homeopathic for shock—was poured into the lipless cavity that had been his mouth. They gave him lobelia and skullcap for the pain... His breathing would slow, then stop, and my mother—and the heavenly host of women who worked for her—would fly about, adjusting chakras and tapping pressure points, anything to coax his brittle lungs to resume their rattle. ... When I walked through the back door, the first thing I saw was Mother grasping a butter knife, which she was using to pry my father’s ears from his skull. (c) Color me queasy. Thank you!Q:I thought of Mother, and of the many times she’d told me that antibiotics poison the body, that they cause infertility and birth defects. That the spirit of the Lord cannot dwell in an unclean vessel, and that no vessel is clean when it forsakes God and relies on man. Or maybe Dad had said that last part. (c) Of course. Lovely ideas:Q:Usually I saw something else. Proof that my ancestors walked that peak, watching and waiting, angels at their command. (c)Q:Tyler stepped into a void. I don’t know why he did it and neither does he. He can’t explain where the conviction came from, or how it burned brightly enough to shine through the black uncertainty. But I’ve always supposed it was the music in his head, some hopeful tune the rest of us couldn’t hear, the same secret melody he’d been humming when he bought that trigonometry book, or saved all those pencil shavings. (c)Q:There’s a sense of sovereignty that comes from life on a mountain, a perception of privacy and isolation, even of dominion. In that vast space you can sail unaccompanied for hours, afloat on pine and brush and rock. It’s a tranquility born of sheer immensity; it calms with its very magnitude, which renders the merely human of no consequence. (c)Q:The first time I saw King’s College, Cambridge, I didn’t think I was dreaming, but only because my imagination had never produced anything so grand. My eyes settled on a clock tower with stone carvings. I was led to the tower, then we passed through it and into the college. There was a lake of perfectly clipped grass and, across the lake, an ivory-tinted building I vaguely recognized as Greco-Roman. But it was the Gothic chapel, three hundred feet long and a hundred feet high, a stone mountain, that dominated the scene. (c)Q:“Here you stand, upright, hands in your pockets.” He gestured toward the other students. “See how they hunch? How they cling to the wall?” …“Everyone has undergone a change,” he said. “The other students were relaxed until we came to this height. Now they are uncomfortable, on edge. You seem to have made the opposite journey. This is the first time I’ve seen you at home in yourself. It’s in the way you move: it’s as if you’ve been on this roof all your life.” …“So your legs are stronger? Is that why you can stand in this wind?”I had to think before I could answer. “I can stand in this wind, because I’m not trying to stand in it,” I said. “The wind is just wind. You could withstand these gusts on the ground, so you can withstand them in the air. There is no difference. Except the difference you make in your head.” (c)Q:“I’m just standing,” I said. “You are all trying to compensate, to get your bodies lower because the height scares you. But the crouching and the sidestepping are not natural. You’ve made yourselves vulnerable. If you could just control your panic, this wind would be nothing.” (c)Q:I had decided to study not history, but historians. I suppose my interest came from the sense of groundlessness I’d felt since learning about the Holocaust and the civil rights movement—since realizing that what a person knows about the past is limited, and will always be limited, to what they are told by others. I knew what it was to have a misconception corrected—a misconception of such magnitude that shifting it shifted the world. Now I needed to understand how the great gatekeepers of history had come to terms with their own ignorance and partiality. I thought if I could accept that what they had written was not absolute but was the result of a biased process of conversation and revision, maybe I could reconcile myself with the fact that the history most people agreed upon was not the history I had been taught. Dad could be wrong, and the great historians Carlyle and Macaulay and Trevelyan could be wrong, but from the ashes of their dispute I could construct a world to live in. In knowing the ground was not ground at all, I hoped I could stand on it. (c)Q:No comma, no period, no adjective or adverb was beneath his interest. He made no distinction between grammar and content, between form and substance. A poorly written sentence was a poorly conceived idea, and in his view the grammatical logic was as much in need of correction. “Tell me,” he would say, “why have you placed this comma here? What relationship between these phrases are you hoping to establish?” When I gave my explanation sometimes he would say, “Quite right,” and other times he would correct me with lengthy explanations of syntax. (c)Q:From my father I had learned that books were to be either adored or exiled. Books that were of God—books written by the Mormon prophets or the Founding Fathers—were not to be studied so much as cherished, like a thing perfect in itself. I had been taught to read the words of men like Madison as a cast into which I ought to pour the plaster of my own mind, to be reshaped according to the contours of their faultless model. I read them to learn what to think, not how to think for myself. Books that were not of God were banished; they were a danger, powerful and irresistible in their cunning. (c)Q:There were wonderful suppositions embedded in this method of reading: that books are not tricks, and that I was not feeble. (c)Q:I stared at the other students as they passed, taking in every silk dress, every heavily lined eye. I obsessed over the beauty of them.At dinner I listened to the cheerful chatter of my friends while longing for the isolation of my room. (c)Q:It was a relief to escape all that refinement and beauty—to be allowed to be unlovely and not a point of contrast. (c)Q:“You should trust Professor Steinberg. If he says you’re a scholar—‘pure gold,’ I heard him say—then you are.”“This is a magical place,” I said. “Everything shines here.” (c)"
54,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,Rating 3 out of 5,"I have mixed feelings about this book! On one hand, I found it courageous of Tara Westover to write so candidly about her childhood growing up in a Mormon survivalist family. The physical and emotional abuse she experienced at the hands of her parents and older brother Shawn were horrifying and gripping. I found her writing style easy-to-follow and immersive enough to keep me engaged in the story. Her feelings of self-doubt and the self-gaslighting she went through all came across poignantly and realistically.To me, a memoir often consists of both the events that happened and the author’s reflection on those events – I found the latter lacking in Educated. It’s clear to me that Westover’s parents and older brother are extremely abusive and gaslighting. I’m not judging Westover as a person for not labeling their behaviors as such, though I didn’t feel like her appraisal of their actions felt complete, in a sense. For example, at one point she writes about how she thinks that her father has undiagnosed bipolar disorder, which I’d say is a more or less fair assumption based on how she describes him. However, I wish she had written more about that because people with mental illnesses like bipolar can be incredibly kind and non-abusive – so the relationship between her dad having bipolar disorder and her dad’s abuse felt muddled and potentially stigmatizing. Furthermore, a lot of her family members are incredibly misogynistic and racist, and I wish Westover had gone a step further and explicitly named them as such. J.D. Vance and Amy Chua, both incredibly problematic people who’ve espoused racist views, have endorsed this book, and my guess is that they’ve done so because Westover is complicit in creating a “pull yourself up by the bootstraps” narrative here without more deeply reflecting on the roles of white supremacy, patriarchy, and other forms of oppression in her and her family’s story. She touches on these topics (e.g., writing a little bit about when she first discovered the term feminism in a nonnegative light, through her education) though that didn’t satisfy me. Like, her father openly espoused the belief that enslaved people preferred to be enslaved because they were treated well by their masters so I’m not sure how much more racist you can get than that??Anyway, it was an interesting read though not sure I’d recommend it unless you’re pretty compelled by the synopsis. Again, I appreciate her courage in writing about this, especially after learning that her parents hired a lawyer or more than one lawyer to dispute her account – gaslighting people will do that. Still, I wanted a bit more from the book overall."

56,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent,Rating 4 out of 5,"When a girl raised on a mountain in Idaho by her survivalist fundamentalist Mormon family sets foot in a classroom for the first time at the age of 17, how will things turn out? Can she ever escape the past?Yeah, I made that sound like one of the sleazy thrillers I'm fond of but Educated is a memoir, not a potboiler. I don't normally read memoirs but I decided to take Random House up on their offer when they came knocking.Educated is the story of Tara Westover's childhood on Buck's Peak, a mountain in Idaho, and her eventual leaving the mountain behind to pursue and education. It doesn't sound very interesting when you say it like that but her upbringing was crazy. Raised by a anti-government survivalist and fundamentalist Mormon father, Tara's early life was anything but ordinary: little education other than learning to read, being nearly worked to death in the scrapyard by her father, tormented by her probably-schizophrenic brother, not even sure of her own birthday. And then she decides to go to college...The first third of the book was pretty bleak. I kept forgetting it wasn't a work of fiction and wanted to see a couple people dead in the snow. Once Tara goes to college, it's her against her family's beliefs. We all know how hard people cling to beliefs, just look at the ongoing debate on who the best captain of the Enterprise was. Even though it's pretty clear that it's Jean-Luc Picard.Tara's journey was a trip back and forth through the labyrinth of her family's beliefs and a conflict between her desire to belong and the desire for more than just being someone's wife on a mountain. One thing I quite liked was that she never dragged her family's Mormon beliefs through the mud even though it would have been the easiest thing in the world for her to do and pretty understandable given everything it cost her.Parts of the book are heartbreaking and it makes the end that much more satisfying. Tara getting her PhD despite where she came from and what it cost her makes me think I've probably squandered some of the opportunities I've been given over the years. 4.5 out of 5 stars."

--“Because of You” Kelly Clarkson, Songwriters: David Hodges / Kelly Clarkson / Ben Moody
”The hill is paved with wild wheat. If the conifers and sagebrush are soloists, the wheat field is a corps de ballet, each stem following all the rest in bursts of movement, a million ballerinas bending, one after the other, as great gales dent their golden heads.”

”On the highway below, the school bus rolls past without stopping.	“I am only seven, but I understand that it is this fact, more than any other, that makes my family different: we don’t go to school.”
At some point she had been taught rudimentary reading skills, but there was no real ‘home-schooling.’ Up until she sought out a real education, her ‘schooling’ consisted primarily of living life. Assisting her parents in their roles.
”I had been educated in the rhythms of the mountain, rhythms in which change was never fundamental, only cyclical. The same sun appeared each morning, swept over the valley and dropped behind the peak. The snows that fell in winter always melted in the spring. Our lives were a cycle—the cycle of the day, the cycle of the seasons—circles of perpetual change that, when complete, meant nothing had changed at all. I believed my family was a part of this immortal pattern, that we were, in some sense, eternal. But eternity belonged only to the mountain.”
A family of seven children, a father who believes the End of Days is imminent, a mother who followed the teachings of her faith, believed her husband to be the head of the house and bent her will, bent her ideas of right and wrong to his will. Birth certificates were viewed as a tool that the government could use to force them to make their children attend government-run schools and be taught ideas fed by the government. Medical doctors, clinics, likewise – another way for the government to know where they were, what they were up to, another method to steal their freedom to choose, to take away their autonomy. Food storage for emergency preparedness takes on an end-of-days tone, beyond the standard fears, in-case-of-earthquake, or loss of electricity to in case of attack, with their father’s primary fears of attack being by the government. Guns are added in quantity.In between, there is some lovely writing, some horrific stories, even some sweet reminiscing about this home, the stories of home, the stories her father told of her of the mountains around their home, and other stories, including her relationship with her father.
”There’s a story my father used to tell about the peak. She was a grand old thing, a cathedral of a mountain… From a distance, you could see the impression of a woman’s body on the mountain face: her legs formed of huge ravines, her hair a spray of pines fanning over the northern ridge… My father called her the Indian Princess.“All my father’s stories were about our mountain, our valley, our jagged little patch of Idaho. He never told me what to do if I left the mountain, if I crossed oceans and continents and found myself in strange terrain, where I could no longer search the horizon for the Princess. He never told me how I’d know when it was time to come home.” 
This is a strong, compelling story, a controversial one. While there may be some variation in her story from the “truth,” I didn’t find this impossible to believe. Improbable, perhaps. Heartbreaking? Yes. Out of the range of “normal”? Absolutely. I viewed this as an ‘against all odds’ type of story, true to the extent that she believes that this is how her life was. If there are variations in how she’s shared her story, it is her truth to tell. As for how her father, in particular, viewed his personally manufactured version of faith, and then twisted it to enforce his desires and to lend credence to his bizarre demands, or excuse his dangerous commands and behavior - nothing can possibly excuse that.  Many thanks, once again, to the Public Library system, and the many Librarians that manage, organize and keep it running, for the loan of this book!"

În pofida subtitlului, ar fi, cred, o greșeală să citești acest volum ca o prezentare a adevărului adevărat. Nu e un „memoir” în cel mai strict sens al cuvîntului.În definitiv, Învățare nu e un referat autobiografic și însăși Tara Westover arată, chiar la sfîrșit, cît de amăgitoare e amintirea (și cît de ambiguă realitatea), mai ales cînd ești martor și narator al propriei vieți. Să ne amintim cît de puțin credibili sînt martorii unei crime și cît de tare se contrazic depozițiile lor. Așa încît a-i reproșa că trigonometria nu se poate învăța de unul singur, că fanaticul ei tată (mormon milenarist, profet al Sfîrșitului) nu se rușinează să strîngă bani și nici să folosească telefonul sau calculatorul înseamnă a greși ținta. În plus, Tara Westover menționează explicit că a trăit din bursele primite.Omul fantazează masiv, chiar atunci cînd își propune să noteze adevărul și numai adevărul, și orice autobiografie devine inevitabil o poveste despre sine alterată puternic de memoria afectivă. E limpede că Tara Westover nu și-a simpatizat părinții și nici pe sadicul ei frățior Shawn: sentimentele amestecate ale autoarei pot fi ghicite dincolo de rînduri. Relatarea este - în chip necesar, aș spune - părtinitoare. Poate că părinții, Gene și Faye Westover (de fapt, Val și LaRee Westover), n-au fost chiar atît de aspri, poate că Tara Westover a exagerat tocmai pentru a-și dovedi sieși dreptatea.Prozatoarea relatează, în fond, cum (și cît de greu) poate fi cucerită „libertatea interioară” (cea despre care a vorbit Isaiah Berlin, menționat în text), cum (și cît de greu) renunți la credințele primite în copilărie. Confesiunea Tarei Westover e limpede, dar fără mari virtuți literare (să mă ierte Bill Gates). În Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit, Jeanette Winterson a povestit cu mai mult talent o experiență similară.P. S. Intervențiile membrilor familiei, după publicarea cărții, m-au convins că e bine să privim Învățare ca pe o autobiografie puternic ficționalizată.

The first half of the book had inconsistencies that left me with more questions than answers, and there is some controversy with family members who have come forward saying there are inaccuracies. A memoir is the telling of events from the perspective of the author. It's her story to tell. I hope she wrote the book in good faith, and this is her perception of the truth as she remembers it. Perhaps her interpretation of some of the events are different than her siblings. It happens.The second half of the book is not only about her education, it's a horrific description of the physical abuse she suffered from one of her brothers. She writes with clarity the emotional devastation and consequences of the abuse and the pain of her parent's disbelief and lack of support. I wish the author the best and hope she and her family can get the help they need and find a way to heal.2.5 stars rounded up to 3*Thank you to Netgalley for a copy of the book in exchange for an honest reviewThanks to my fellow traveling sisters for another great discussion:https://twogirlslostinacouleereading...."

With this clarified I will explain the reasons for my rating.The beginning is confusing, which can scarcely be considered a plus. Initial questions that arise are resolved as one reads, and the further one goes the less is one willing to abandon the book or even put it down. I needed to know how the problems would be resolved. Familial problems are what this book is about. Serious problems related to mental and physical abuse. This is by no means a light read. The family is Mormon, and they live in Idaho. The father is authoritarian, with clear fundamentalist leanings. There are seven children, of which Tara, the author, is the youngest. The mother is a midwife and a herbalist and supportive of her husband. The children are not educated nor given proper medical care. Any talk of home-schooling is a sham. The situation is extreme. This is what you will read about and about how difficult it is to leave the family and forge a new route. Three of the children do succeed, but what is the price that must be paid? The bonds of family, even those built on dishonesty, on fear and physical and psychological abuse prove to be almost impossible to break. This is the central focus of the book.We are told in the beginning that this book Is 
not
 about the Mormon faith. I beg to differ. What happens in this family is tied closely to Mormon beliefs; the two cannot be separated.Tara is telling of her ties to and her alienation from her family. What is presented is what has happened 
as she remembers it
 and she admits that her memories are at times confused. There are holes, lacking information and conflicting versions and there could be exaggerations. I am left with an uncomfortable feeling. I am not sure how much of this is absolutely true. Too much is fuzzy. All too often the author paraphrases. In other cases, quotes are given. I found myself wondering about the veracity of these too. How is it possible she remembers that? In any case, we are hearing one side of the story; I am not comfortable with this. I do not have adequate information to criticize specifics, but I am left uneasy. I certainly have difficulty believing all we are told. Call me a skeptic. Furthermore, I find it strange that having completed the book I do not feel I know Tara. Something is missing.The audiobook narration by Julia Whelan was good, in that it was not hard to follow, but clearly it is Tara’s views we are supposed to accept. I have given the narration three stars.I am rating the book, not Tara. Although I feel unsure about the details, my sympathy lies with her, not with her father, nor her mother, nor her brother, Shawn. Go ahead. Read the book. See what you think."

It had never occurred to me that my voice might be as strong as theirs.” Tara Westover’a anguished story is about growing up in the mountains of Idaho in a fundamentalist Mormon/survivalist family led by a father convinced that the socialist government in every respect was evil. As a family they prepared for “The Days of Abomination” and saw the opposition as The Illuminati. They lived pretty much “off the grid” for a long time—birthing at home (Tara’s mom is a midwife and herbalist; her Dad ran a junkyard). For most of Tara's youth, they had no birth certificates, no social security numbers, went to no doctors, had no contact with any media, and had no public schooling at all. In the mountains she was defined largely by her father and brother, Sean, who were verbally and physically abusive, and throughout she painfully struggles with how to honor her father and his narrow, paranoid version of the world as she later learned everything about the world that was largely denied her. “I believed then--and part of me will always believe--that my father's words ought to be my own.” This was a well-written, gripping story, and I typically don't read these kinds of stories but it was highly reviewed and much awarded so I thought I would try it and am glad I did. But it was also really uncomfortable to read. It weighed on me as I read it. I thought of largely discredited memoirs and wondered if this would become one of those, as her story is hard to fathom--both the horrific parts and the successful parts--her trauma and escape are almost unbelievable. She also has what she describes as a nervous breakdown at one point as her family thought she was evil and dangerous for not following her father’s dictates to live in the home and (dangerously) work for him as a scrapper. Her father is crazy and her brother Sean is crazy-violent, threatening to kill her, and no one (publically, at least) agrees with her side of the story. A nightmare. And though she escaped this world, she never is entirely happy, as she loses her family—such as it is—in the process.In her view, her mother, forced to become an unlicensed midwife by her husband, was a tower of womanly strength, devoted to her bipolar, authoritarian husband. The family had to bow to his will, paralyzed by his delusions, or leave, and she eventually left. One trigger for Westover’s father, as it was for many survivalists then, was a paranoid interpretation of the Ruby Ridge “killing” of Randy Weaver, another survivalist. Early on, Dad interpreted the Holy Bible as telling him that, for instance, milk was sinful and they only used molasses and honey thereafter. He was crazy in so many ways, and only Tara had the strength to finally tell the truth about him and her brother. Everyone else in her family bowed down to him.But Westover, almost unbelievably—I had to finally google her to make sure she really was who she says she was!—not only graduated from BYU, but went on to graduate with a PhD in History from Cambridge, becoming truly “educated” about herself, her family, and the world. At Cambridge a Dr. Kerry attempts to cure her of her imposter syndrome, recognizing her special talents and writer and thinker.“This is a magical place,” I said. “Everything shines here.” “You must stop yourself from thinking like that,” Dr. Kerry said, his voice raised. “You are not fool’s gold, shining only under a particular light. Whomever you become, whatever you make yourself into, that is who you always were. It was always in you. Not in Cambridge. In you. You are gold. And returning to BYU, or even to that mountain you came from, will not change who you are. It may change how others see you, it may even change how you see yourself—even gold appears dull in some lighting—but that is the illusion. And it always was.” I was raised in the ultra-conservative (Dutch) Christian Reformed Church. Growing up, I went to church twice every Sunday—my parents had gone to church three times on Sundays, one service in Dutch—was not allowed to play catch or swim or ride a bicycle on Sunday as I grew up. When I was required to go to classes to study the Heidelberg Catechism with Rev. Jerome Julian, I skipped the classes but was ultimately forced to go tutorials at his house. When I met with the deacons and elders to see if I was worthy to make Profession of Faith, I was upbraided for refusing to commit to never see a film again. From the time I was in middle school, I thad taken notes questioning the sin-soaked sermons I was forced to listen to. But when the time came I did go to Calvin College, my church's college, that I loved in the Vietnam War years, when I was in theater and wrote fiction and played music and studied English, and even taught subsequently in western Michigan parochial schools but in a matter of years I left The Church forever. As I listened to this book I thought of people in my community who were not allowed to wear brightly colored clothes, who had no televisions, which we now associate with fundamentalist religious views of all stripes. I was a working class kid who was the only one in my family to graduate college, leaving my tradition as she did. I was lucky to avoid the worst of my tradition, but I thought of it sometimes as I read this book, and I thought of the contemporary American landscape, too.This book resonates with our present time in the US where white supremacism, separatism, nationalism, survivalism, fundamentalism, sexism, and mental derangement seem to be ascendant. It seems like a witch's brew of all of the above were keys to understanding Tara’s family. She grew up ignorant about sexual matters, uneducated about them, but she believed her brother was probably right in calling her a “whore” because she put on make-up—at 15 she didn’t even know what sexual intercourse was and got a pregnancy test! The contrast was the university, where, in her first class she only had heard of the name—Shakespeare, never had read a word from him, but had to drop it because it was a senior level course. She learned from a roommate that the reason she failed the midterm in Art History is that she had to actually read the textbook. She had never been in school of any kind! In the university she learned of the Holocaust and slavery, really for the first time; she learned of bipolar disorder, paranoid schizophrenia, she learned of antibiotics and went to a doctor for the first time, she accepted a student grant from the government (!), all socialist acts her family knew the university and the government would corrupt her with. That she keeps going home where she has been threatened and hurt and lied to resonates with familiar abuse scenarios. But ultimately she finds the courage to go on with her new life and not back to her old one.“You can love someone and still choose to say goodbye to them,” she says now. “You can miss a person every day, and still be glad that they are no longer in your life.” There are anguished and transcendent moments in this book, moments that made me weep, such as this one, that occurred when her mother, through an email —for a time, though not permanently—acknowledged that she had not adequately protected her daughter:“There was a pause, then more words appeared—words I hadn’t known I needed to hear, but once I saw them, I realized I’d been searching my whole life for them. You were my child. I should have protected you. I lived a lifetime in the moment I read those lines, a life that was not the one I had actually lived. I became a different person, who remembered a different childhood. I didn’t understand the magic of those words then, and I don’t understand it now. I know only this: that when my mother told me she had not been the mother to me that she wished she’d been, she became that mother for the first time.” “The decisions I made after that moment were not the ones she [her mother] would have made. They were the choices of a changed person, a new self. You could call this selfhood many things. Transformation. Metamorphosis. Falsity. Betrayal. I call it an education.” This book disturbed my dreams, and though I am glad to be done with being haunted by it, I am also glad to have read it for its insights. This is precisely the point of Educated, that she becomes properly educated, after having been “educated” very narrowly and falsely. It is also very much in one sense a kind of typical growing up story, in that she finds a way to define herself on her own terms rather than the terms given to her my her parents, or religion, or society.“We are all of us more complicated than the roles we are assigned in the stories other people tell.” Tara Westover, no longer a Mormon, singing a Mormon hymn:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlO_Q...Westover on CNN on growing up survivalist:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kgVl..."
64,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt,Rating 4 out of 5,"While there has been a great deal of hype over Tara Westover’s memoir, I wanted to get my hands on it to judge for myself. As Westover claims in her author’s note—and I wish to offer before getting too deep into the review—the fact that she grew up in a Mormon household does not directly correlate to her lack of formal education. Tara Westover opens her memoir discussing fragmented memories she had of growing up in a rural Idaho community. The last of a large brood, Tara grew up believing that family was a cohesive unit that would help one another under any circumstances. Her father was the traditional patriarch and ran a very tight ship, wanting no government intervention where it could be helped. Few of the children were issued with birth certificates, driver’s licences were frowned upon, and formal medical aide was strictly forbidden. This complicated things on a number of levels, but it was the refusal of a formal education that stung the most. With a father who ran his own scrap yard and did odd building jobs around the county, Tara was eventually expected to share in the workload, hauling metal and risking her safety to keep the money coming into the house. Throughout the piece, Tara recollects many injuries the children sustained from unsafe working conditions, which was exacerbated by the refusal to seek medical attention. Tara’s mother worked as a mid-wife and herbalist, bringing those forms of medical treatment into their home, where tinctures, oils, and salves were the only means of relief for any pain, alongside a belief that God’s will would solve all other concerns. Notably, this extended to vaccinations, which none of the children received. Living in this overly devout Mormon household, Tara developed a strict set of morals and views on life, which she brought with her when she got older. After watching one of her brothers choose to go to college and succeed, she, too, wanted to take the plunge. Without the formal education under her belt, Tara was forced to rely on textbooks she could buy and cramming for an aptitude test that would permit her to attend post-secondary. As she recounts it, Tara struggled to pass and created her own narrative about how she was ‘schooled’ at home, but did succeed in earning a spot at Brigham Young University. Once there, the real education began for this 17 year-old, who realised how out of her depth she was, even amongst other Mormons. Stories so outlandish that the reader may not believe them, even to see them on the printed page. Once she got into her niche, Tara was able to excel academically and socially, opening new and exciting doors for her. As the memoir gains momentum, the reader will see just how varied education turned out to be for Tara Westover, who thrived under highly troublesome circumstances to become the woman she is today, even though that education helped drive a wedge between herself and the rest of the family. Powerful in its delivery, any reader looking for a highly entertaining piece that mixes determination with perseverance need look no further.I can fully understand why this piece received all the praise it garnered, as it is not only a harrowing tale, but also one that is full of well-crafted vignettes. Tara Westover tells her story as only she can, mixing memories with implanted suggestions to create the personal narrative that helped shape who she became. The attentive reader will see the education themes throughout, which surpass the traditional and formal scholastic learning, riding the highs of her triumphs and the lows of her bitter defeats. Even as she shielded many of her siblings names with pseudonyms, the reader cannot help but connect to them in their daily interactions. Tara weaves stories of sibling fortitude and abuse she suffered at their hands, while also trying to survive in a household that was isolated and sought to keep prying eyes out of their business. Tara opens herself up and provides a raw and insightful look into her life, one that pulls no punches. Her honesty can be jarring at times, but is also sobering as she reveals aspects about herself that the reader might not have know existed. Baffling how someone without formal education could excel as she did—receiving a PhD at the end of her studies— and then pen such a captivating piece. I found myself enthralled throughout and did not want it to end. This is one book I would recommend everyone at least try if they have any interest in memoirs or watching people overcome major struggles.Kudos, Madam Westover, for such a wonderful piece. I feel as if I know you personally and can use your grit to propel me towards greater things.

65,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2752994-dem,Rating 4 out of 5,"Written with the skill and resonance of a work of fiction, Tara Westover's memoir is heart-breaking and frank and yet hopeful in its telling.Westover was born in 1986, grown up in a rural Idaho radical Mormon Family dominated by her father Gene who was determined to raise his children away from the clutches of the government and the wider world. She had never heard of the Holocaust, Napoleon, or Martin Luther King and she had thought Europe was a country. When she gains a place in college through self education at the age of 16 Tara's enlightenment begins and she is at last EDUCATED.This is without doubt a terrific, page turning book, well written, often times brutal and shocking. It is difficult to understand that a family lived and raised children in these conditions and isolation in the 80s and 90s and this book for me read more like an account from sometime back in the 30s/40s. However this is Tara's story warts and all and she tells it well. I admired how she overcame her obstacles and produced an amazing book as well as an opportunity to tell her story to the world. A compelling and interesting read and a writer than oozes talent and I look forward more work by Tara Westover.
After reading a book like this I am always conscious of the family members behind the story and how they feel about their dirty laundry being aired in public and I researched a little on the internet and there are members of her family who don't seem to agree with Tara's memories or some of the accounts in this book and I am sure books like this can be quite painful for families to read. However this is Tara's story and I can only read,review and rate the book on the written word in front of me and how I reacted to those words 
  Recommended reading and a book that would make a terrific book club read.My thanks to Net Galley for an opportunity to read this book in return for an honest review."

This tells of a young woman’s off-grid upbringing in Idaho and the hard work that took her from almost complete ignorance to a Cambridge PhD. Westover’s is an incredible story about testing the limits of perseverance and sanity. Her father may have been a survivalist, but her psychic survival is the most impressive outcome here. What takes this astonishing life story to the next level, making it a classic to sit alongside memoirs by Alexandra Fuller, Mary Karr and Jeannette Walls, is the writing. Westover writes with calm authority, channeling the style of the scriptures and history books that were formative in her upbringing and education.See my full review at BookBrowse.

67,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book has been on the bestseller lists for long and has been reviewed extensively. This was a fascinating, disturbing, and inspiring read. Much of the content was very unexpected. Tara Westover is one of seven children of Gene and Faye, a Mormon family (the book does not use real names for much of the family) in Buck’s Peak in Idaho. Gene has a deep-rooted distrust of anything government, as also hospitals. As a result, Tara, her sister Audrey, and brothers are all home schooled by their mother. None of them ever go to doctors, and it is their mother’s oils and other home remedies they turn to. Gene also believes various conspiracy theories & prophecies and prepares by stocking/burying supplies & weapons for a crisis. He also holds regressive views that the place for women is in the home & kitchen. Tara gets a delayed birth certificate at the age of 9. Gene is especially disappointed that nothing remarkable happens on 1 Jan 2000 (addressing the Y2K matter). He continues to rally on and off about the impending end of the world. Other than this, one of Tara’s brothers Shawn (who has a serious head injury once) is especially abusive with both sisters. Her brother Tyler is the only one who encourages Tara to seek a life outside. Tara joins Brigham Young University, after taking the ACT exam, stepping into a classroom for the first time at the age of 17. Adjustment is quite difficult initially as there are a lot of things she does not know about (for instance her professor and class are taken aback that she does not know about the holocaust). After that, she goes on to Cambridge University, and finally to Harvard to get her PhD. Relationships are tricky for her considering her background, and what she has been through.Tara clarifies at the outset that the book is not about Mormonism, and that is true – not her focus in the book at all. As she is exposed to formal education and more information, Tara believes her dad most likely has undiagnosed bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Her mother wants to stick by her dad, and most of her brothers & sisters are hesitant to confront their dad or Shawn, though they discuss it on and off. While Gene having bipolar or schizophrenia is a possibility, neuroscience has uncovered quite a lot about the delusions/biases/views which people form. A lot of it is what people convince themselves to believe early on and later systematically reinforce by refusing to introspect with an open mind. During the course of this book, I learnt about a book written by Tara’s mother LaRee Westover (her mother’s real name) ‘Educating’, which counters a lot of this book – mainly suggesting that the family was just conservative and living life their own way. While ‘Educating’ has largely poor reviews, we do need to allow for the fact that biographies are rarely entirely accurate and almost always show the writer in glowing terms. While it is impossible to be sure of everything cited in the book, a lot of it feels authentic. I do feel though that Tara is very dismissive of her mother’s herbal therapies, just maybe there is something of value there – after all the company her mother founded had been doing well, though sales dropped after the release of ‘Educated’. Not that one should turn to this instead of modern medical care for serious ailments like the family did. A lot of what Tara goes through is quite disturbing and her achievements are very inspiring. Should family matters be discussed publicly is a complex and difficult question – but considering the background in this case, feel it is fully justified. Much recommended. The audiobook narration by Julia Whelan was excellent. My rating: 4.75 / 5."

My family struggled financially, but the library is free, and every weekend Mom would take my sister and me to the library. It was the greatest thing ever: You got to pick out books and they just gave them to you. FOR FREE. My parents, who are not well educated, wanted a different life for my sister and me, which they did their best to do by making both of us book smart. Tara Westover’s family, her father in particular, thought all book learning that wasn’t the Bible was socialist brainwashing, so he made sure his seven kids didn’t go to public school. Theoretically they were home schooled, but really, he used his small children to do dangerous jobs in the junk yard using dangerous equipment, which was a particular problem since he didn’t believe in doctors or hospitals, even after explosions and car crashes. One winter Tara had strep throat, and instead of getting antibiotics, which would have rid her of the sore throat in a couple days, he had her stand outside in the freezing Idaho winter and open her mouth so the sun could shine in her mouth. Needless to say, all she got were more sore throats.Her mother went along with the unhinged things her dad said, I guess because especially radical Mormon women are supposed to be docile and bow to their husband’s will. Out of the seven kids, three earned PhD’s despite having no formal education grades K-12 and the other four didn’t get a GED and became financially dependent on their mother’s business of making magical ointments that were obviously directly from God. I felt bad for Tara constantly being told that everything she did rendered her a whore no matter how modestly and manly she dressed. (It was one of her brothers that was particularly brutish to her and their other siblings, but Tara’s family blamed her. Satan got into her, obviously.) No matter what issues you have with your family, I can’t imagine it could be worse than this. Growing up thinking the world was going to end any minute and before it did, the United States government would get you. An education can be quite a subversive act, especially for women. For a long time, men didn’t want women to be able to read, even the Bible, because as soon as you can read, you can learn anything about the whole big world. Bravo to Tara for her courage.For more reviews, please visit http://www.theresaalan.net/blog"

I found it to be awful, in so many different ways:-There is no emotional connection to the author. I've never read an auto-biographical account where the author felt more distant and uninterested in her own story-As many have pointed out, shit does NOT add up. I'd say a James Frey situation except that her life happened so off the grid, there's no one to fact check her. I definitely believe her early life experiences, and also believe they were so awful that they have caused a lot of damage. I don't blame her for the embellishments and inconsistencies-- where was her editor, publisher, etc in this?-This family has so many physical accidents that I felt as though I was reading about Kenny from South Park. If everything she said was true, most would have met their demise sooner than they did-This book meanders around pointlessly. Thankfully there was some order with the chronological telling of her college years, but generally the order of things was nonsensical-SO much abuse that is NEVER addressed. If you're writing a memoir, I expect you to have meditated a bit on these experiences (or if you don't, great, but maybe a book about the experiences isn't a great choice)-COMPLETELY unnecessary and repeated use of the N-word. Sometimes, it must be. But it was said over and over and over to the point where I felt embarrassed reading it. The take-home message was that she didn't understand how bad the word was during her sheltered upbringing. Got it? Yep. No need for that to have been a chapter of being slapped across the face with a slur dozens of times. Yet another indication that she remains unchecked by those who should have been guiding her Overall, reading this was sort of like being trapped in a conversation with someone you know is making stuff up, but they also seem a bit unwell so you feel too badly to exit the conversation.I love memoirs and have enjoyed many in similar veins (several escapees of the FLDS compounds, kidnapping victims, domestic abuse victims) and I've liked them all. I expected this would be a similar experience but it was just terrible. "
70,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,Rating 4 out of 5,"A very high 4 stars.Educated is a powerful and heartbreaking memoir. Tara Westover grew up in Idaho in a Mormon family. She is the youngest of seven children growing up on an isolated rural property. A fundamentalist version of religion fed her father’s paranoia and his antigovernment and survivalist view of the world. Until she was 17 years old, she had never gone to school and was barely homeschooled. Clearly brilliant, she managed to get into college at Brigham Young and eventually made her way to Cambridge University in the UK.Westover’s memoir focuses on her family and their influence over her life and her understanding of the world. There was love in her home life, but it came at a ridiculously high price — intellectual, emotional and physical. (As just one example, there are a few harrowing scenes of physical injuries that her parents were unwilling to treat with the use of conventional medicine). Once she starts separating from her family, there was so much to learn about people, history and politics that had previously been filtered through her father’s paranoid view of the world. While Westover clearly values her ability to get an education and learn about the world, the consequential separation from her family also came at its own high price.Educated is an emotional roller coaster— but it’s not told with melodrama or self pity. Well worth the read. Westover wrote this memoir in her late 20s. I suspect that the story she has to tell is not over.Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy."
71,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50893023-johann-jobis89,Rating 5 out of 5,"""Whomever you become, whatever you make yourself into, that is who you always were.""Tara Westover grew up in an extreme Mormon, survivalist family. Having never set foot in a classroom before the age of 17, Tara embarks on a road of self-discovery and self-invention through the means of obtaining an education. Not gonna lie, I loved every minute of this book. I don't read a lot of non-fiction unless it's true crime, so this was a little outside the norm for me, but I'm really glad I gave it a shot! I must commend the audiobook narrator, Julia Whelan, in particular as she did an incredible job of bringing Tara's story to life.You are hooked from pretty much the very first page as Tara tells you about her very conservative upbringing. Her family live in the mountains of Idaho, preparing for the end of the world. Her mother is a both a midwife and a healer, using herbs for all their aches and pains, and her father salvages junk. She doesn't have a birth certificate, she doesn't go to school and she isn't brought to the doctor if she's unwell. It's a world pretty far removed from my own and I found it absolutely fascinating. And that's before you even get to Tara's commitment to educating herself and ultimately obtaining her PhD.Education is something I have always took for granted. I couldn't imagine growing up not knowing what the Holocaust was - Tara had not even heard of it herself until she was in college. Yet it is something that if I didn't have it, I would be an entirely different person. The majority of my life has been focused on working for and aiming for the next qualification - once I obtained my PhD I actually felt a little lost as I didn't know what I was supposed to do next? What do you do once you can technically go no further? Hearing Tara's story makes me question if I would have had the same desire and drive to educate myself if it wasn't just something that was automatically part of my life.And Tara's story is SO incredibly inspiring. You really feel her struggles to try and maintain a relationship with her family, whilst at the same time venturing out on her own in an attempt to discover herself and what the rest of the world has to offer. Some parts are tough to read about, such as the abuse she suffered at the hands of her brother Shawn, but at no point does she appear to wallow in self-pity. She tells her story like it is, not seeking out sympathy or praise. The focus of this memoir isn't necessarily the formal education that Tara receives, but it is more about her breaking away from her family and inventing herself. I honestly felt an insane amount pride and joy when she finally got her PhD - almost as if I knew her personally, which I think shows how much you can connect with Tara during her story. I personally was a huge fan of the writing. Some of the descriptions of the mountains and surrounding landscapes were stunning. I truly hope Tara ends up writing fiction some day as I would happily buy every single book she writes. She appears to have a knack for both storytelling and beautiful prose.This will probably end up being on my list of top 2019 reads. I listened to this on audiobook and it was the best motivation for kicking my ass out the door to go and exercise - I just HAD to know what happened next. Highly recommend. This one gets all the stars!!!"

73,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1128612-pattymacdotcomma,Rating 5 out of 5,"Another UPDATE: The Westover family company, with photos https://butterflyexpress.net/welcome/usUPDATE: an interview with Tara. https://www.cbsnews.com/video/tara-we...5★“Dad waves at a tower of cars and says, “Luke, cut off those tanks, yeah?” And Luke says, “Sure thing, Dad.” He lays the torch against his hip and strikes flint. Flames erupt from nowhere and take him. He screams, fumbles with the twine, screams again, and takes off through the weeds.“There are life-and-death incidents and accidents and attacks all through this memoir, which reads like some sort of science fiction or dystopian thriller. We know Tara survives, because she wrote it, but I will give nothing else away.Read the long, informative blurb on Goodreads for a good summary. I can’t really add to that other than to say this is a compelling read. Father and Mother are fundamentalist, Mormon preppers, preparing for when the government comes to get them. Tara has grown up with warning stories, and since she and her siblings are ”home-schooled” (meaning they work in the junkyard with their dad instead of going to school), she had no frame of reference. This is about the Weavers.“‘There’s a family not far from here,’ Dad said. ‘They’re freedom fighters. They wouldn’t let the Government brainwash their kids in them public schools, so the Feds came after them.’ Dad exhaled, long and slow. ‘The Feds surrounded the family’s cabin, kept them locked in there for weeks, and when a hungry child, a little boy, snuck out to go hunting, the Feds shot him dead.’”Why wouldn’t she believe him? When you’re a little kid, your parents know everything. When you go to school, you may start questioning your parents because you think your teacher knows everything. Tara’s teacher is her mother, and her mother is devoted to her father. She can’t understand why one minute her father is laughing about the danger she faces clambering on top of piles of junk to separate bits for sale, and the next minute he looks terrified, stockpiling stuff. This is not a spoiler, it’s very early in the book.“Fourteen years after the incident with the Weavers, I would sit in a university classroom and listen to a professor of psychology describe something called bipolar disorder. Until that moment I had never heard of mental illness. I knew people could go crazy—they’d wear dead cats on their heads or fall in love with a turnip—but the notion that a person could be functional, lucid, persuasive, and something could still be wrong, had never occurred to me.”She faced danger daily, forced to work in the junkyard with her father, who was tossing machinery parts in bins. She was nearly brained and cut with something and called to him to stop, but he kept right on throwing.“I almost had it when Dad flung a catalytic converter. I leapt aside, cutting my hand on the serrated edge of a punctured tank. I wiped the blood on my jeans and shouted, ‘Don’t throw them here! I’m here!’ Dad looked up, surprised. He’d forgotten I was there. When he saw the blood, he walked over to me and put a hand on my shoulder. ‘Don’t worry, honey,’ he said. ‘God is here, working right alongside us. He won’t let anything hurt you. But if you are hurt, then that is His will’.Her grandparents were not fundamentalists or preppers. Mother’s mother, Grandma-over-in-town, couldn’t believe her daughter hadn’t told Tara and the others to wash with soap. Basic cleanliness was overlooked. This was not a clean, lovely, homespun existence. This was pretty much squalor.Her father pushed her mother to become a midwife after she had assisted the local midwife before she moved. Mother was frightened, but after a series of accidents and injuries to herself, which gave her migraines and probably brain damage, she became completely absorbed in her potions and lotions and herbal and homeopathic remedies for everything. She started clicking her fingers to “listen” for whether somebody had cancer or other infection.Father’s response to every ailment or injury was “Bring him home. Your mother will deal with it”, including the kid in the first quote, who was on fire, running through the fields.Brains spilling out on the highway? Your mother will deal with it. Broke your bones? Your mother will deal with it.It would be laughable if it weren’t so desperately real and tragic. Tara is now estranged from her parents, because rather than believe her, they’ve sided with a brother who lives on their property. Understandable. Easier to ‘believe’ him than his sister who’s gone off and gotten herself all high-and-might educated, eh?Westover never brags, but often questions her own sanity. To deal with her family, she had to withdraw into her mind sometimes as if she weren’t really sitting, stuck listening to her father’s one-hour diatribe about the Feds or whomever he’s down on at the moment. Mostly he just calls her “a whore”, but it turns out they don’t even know how old she is. They registered the first few kids but kept the other off the government books. When they threaten to throw Tara out for something, she protests to her mother to intervene on her behalf. It’s not fair - she’s too young!. . . but when I was your age I was living on my own, getting ready to marry your father.’ ‘You were married at sixteen?’ I said. ‘Don’t be silly,’ she said. ‘You are not sixteen.’I stared at her. She stared at me. ‘Yes, I am. I’m sixteen.’She looked me over. ‘You’re at least twenty.’ She cocked her head. ‘Aren’t you?’ We were silent. My heart pounded in my chest. ‘I turned sixteen in September,’ I said. ‘Oh.’ Mother bit her lip, then she stood and smiled. ‘Well, don’t worry about it then. You can stay. Don’t know what your dad was thinking, really. I guess we forgot. Hard to keep track of how old you kids are.’Unbelievable. Except it isn’t. There are plenty of backwood pockets in the good ol’ US of A that have families cut off from everybody, but eventually, the kids may be enticed away, causing terrible family rifts. And when the potions and lotions start making money, well . . . That’s enough from me.Read it! Thanks to NetGalley and Random House for the preview copy from which I’ve quoted (not NEARLY enough)."
74,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26175098-christine,Rating 5 out of 5,"I have been so fortunate with my last two book choices. My read before this one is a book with great reviews that had been languishing on my shelf for over two years (Where the Crawdads Sing) as I really didn’t think it was my type of book. I finally decided I needed to read it or dump it, so I read it. Five-star read. Educated wasn’t even on my list when I saw it was available on the Libby app last week. I wondered what all the hype was about as it didn’t appeal to me at all and never made my TBR. But again, just look at those incredible ratings. Since I scored on Crawdads, I felt emboldened and thought just maybe I could get lucky and score on this one too while awaiting Fredrik Backman’s Us Against You to come through on Libby. Again, five stars! Nothing ventured, nothing gained, right? I can’t believe I almost didn’t take a chance on these two “out-of-the-box (for me)” reads. The best thing of all is that I am trying to expand into nonfiction, and both of these are nonfiction.Educated. What an interesting memoir. I basically went into it cold as I had not read the blurb for ages. Author Tara Westover opens herself up to the world giving us details of her very rocky childhood and family life. Her parents, devout Mormons, did not allow her to attend school and really did not provide her an education at home except how to work in a junkyard and make tinctures and essential oils. Tara, with little exposure to the outside world, little money, and basically the disapproval of her parents took it on herself to break out and earn her own education that culminated in a PhD. Tara had to overcome all sorts of atrocities, the majority of which originated from her own family. She was left with minimal self-esteem and PTSD. Yet she fought on and eventually found herself and earned an extraordinary education at the same time. In situations like this, one usually needs outside help and Tara found that in several professors she encountered along the way. These were people who saw the potential in Tara and did everything possible to help her achieve a most remarkable education. But most of all it was Tara herself whose dogged efforts led to her stunning accomplishments.Stories like Tara’s remind me of how fortunate I have been in life. I had loving parents who were there to support me in the goals I set for myself. I had no real hindrances in my prolonged endeavor to become a physician. At least nothing that compares whatsoever to what Tara went through. I have such respect for Tara and the battles she survived--battles with her family, with society in general, and with herself to reach her destination. A number of reviewers have found the memoir unsatisfying as they felt parts of the book were unbelievable. I can see why they might think that, but I just have a gut feeling that we are indeed reading the true story. Don’t ask me why, it’s just my impression.Kudos to Tara Westover for sharing her inspiring journey with us. It’s a story that will stick with me for a very long time."
75,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29843800-bianca,Rating 3 out of 5,"I occasionally indulge in memoirs. I wouldn't have paid attention to this one had it not been for the raving reviews of some GR friends. I already knew the premise and I did ask myself whether I should read it, considering that my anti-religion sentiments don't need any more kindling. Curiosity and/or FOMO got the better of me.More often than not I feel even more apprehensive about rating a memoir, as it feels like you're rating somebody's life. Tara Westover is to be admired for escaping such horrible circumstances and ""making it"". The seventh child of a fundamentalist Mormon family, Tara is innocent, barely literate, insecure and mostly unseen. Her father is an authoritarian who makes preparations for end-of-days. Unsurprisingly, he's anti-government, therefore he opts out getting birth certificates for his younger kids and never sends them to school. His wife seems to play mostly the role of a doting wife and mother, never challenging her husbands' crazy behaviour or the one of her kids', especially the psychopath, Shawn. There are some incredible stories throughout this book that left me aghast: Tara survived two car crashes, falling from high up, leg gashes, strangling, hair-pulling and other verbal and physical abuses from an older brother. Also, she witnessed a brothers leg on fire and many other work-related accidents, while helping on the father's scrapping and construction jobs practised with a complete disregard for safety.Truth be told, I found the storytelling disjointed and not particularly well-written. Also, there were gaps and I also had this niggling feeling that certain things were exaggerated and unbelievable. I could have believed some of them more if the family had lived in complete seclusion, fully self-reliant. That wasn't the case, they lived relatively close to paternal grandparents - who didn't seem that extreme, they went to church, the mother had family in town, the father was doing construction jobs etc., the older brothers left home to find jobs. Even Tara attended dancing classes and singing shows. Some of the things didn't quite add up. Despite all the apprehensive, horrible things that occurred, I never got emotionally involved, even though I feel I should have been consumed by it. Unfortunately, I never really got a sense of who Tara really was. I think it's got something to do with the writing and the fact that I had all these questions and feelings which inhibited my emotional connection. Also, while I don't have first-hand knowledge of the American education system, I've read plenty of books and keep up with the news. I'm just incredulous that someone who could barely read, and had to teach herself math, trig and so on (that alone is puzzling), managed to get into college and not just any college. I don't know if it was modesty, Westover never made it sound like she was particularly gifted, with a high IQ, so my incredulity remained. I do realise that this aspect of the book is the easiest to confirm, as there are records, diplomas. Obviously, I'm influenced by the Australian experience - we seem to have more stringent requirements.Anyway, I'm not sorry I've read it. I am just sorry I didn't love it as much as everyone else seems to.I've received this novel via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest review."
76,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6170447-niki,Rating 2 out of 5,"Why is this a memoir and not a court document for a restraining order? I found no redeeming qualities in any of these people. Unlike the 
The Glass Castle
 (memoir) or 
The Great Alone
 (fiction) which are also centered around a family with an unhinged patriarch, Educated offers little light in the darkness. The aforementioned examples were both hard and uncomfortable reads, but I was left a changed person. Educated didn't move me. There was no internal conflict here. The writing is a little bland, the tangents into her academia were downright boring, and the ludicrousness of each encounter and conversation left me aghast. I'm clearly in the minority here, but this was just a bit much for me."

Στο μεσοδιάστημα έχω δώσει αρκετά (έως πολλά) μονάστερα και δυάστερα, αλλά κανείς δεν είπε πως το τελευταίο βιβλίο του Μάρκαρη είναι το αριστούργημα, και ήρθα εγώ ο κακός να του πετάξω ένα μονάστερο στη μούρη.Εδώ ακόμη χειρότερα με την Λίγη Ζωή, διαβάζουμε ένα memoir : πως εσύ κακέ τύπε, βάζεις μονάστερο σε αυτή την βασανισμένη ζωή ; Φτου σου , αλήτη.Είναι πολύ εύκολο να ταυτιστείς με το ""θύμα"": δέχεσαι a priori την ""κατάθεση"" του, όποτε ένοχος ο κατηγορούμενος κύριε Εισαγγελέα ; Not quite. Έχουμε μια κοπελίτσα που μεγάλωσε σε μια πολυμελή οικογένεια Μορμόνων στα βουνά του Αϊντάχο. Δεν πήγε ποτέ στο σχολείο, όπως σχεδόν όλα της αδέρφια, και μάλιστα αυτή και άλλα τρία της αδέρφια δεν υπάρχουν καν για το αμερικάνικο κράτος, γιατί ο πατέρας της ένας ακραίος φοντεμαλιστής που δεν πιστεύει στο αμερικάνικο σύστημα εκπαίδευσης και στην δυτική ιατρική μεταξύ άλλων, δεν τους δήλωσε ποτέ. Υποτίθεται ότι ήταν homeschooled αλλά ούτε καν αυτό : μετά βίας έμαθε να διαβάζει το βιβλίο των Μορμόνων, κάτι θρησκευτικούς ύμνους, ως εκεί. Στα 16 της αποφασίζει να δώσει για το Πανεπιστήμιο. Αγοράζει δύο βιβλία μαθηματικών από την διπλανή πόλη. Δεν αναγνωρίζει όχι μόνο εξισώσεις και πράξεις, αλλά τα ΣΥΜΒΟΛΑ. Την δεύτερη φορά που δίνει ΠΕΡΝΑΕΙ, ενώ όταν της δίνουν την φόρμα multiple choice , δεν την καταλαβαίνει καν. Την δέχεται ένα Αμερικάνικο Μορμονικό Πανεπιστήμιο που από ότι φαίνεται πρέπει να είχε επίπεδο εισαγωγής και φοίτησης ΤΕΙ Λογιστικής Κοζάνης. Προσοχή : περνάει σε ένα Πανεπιστήμιο στα 17 της, ενώ κανονικά θα έπρεπε να ήταν στο Λύκειο. Δέχονται απλά ότι ήταν homeschooled (που ούτε αυτό ήταν), δεν της ζητάνε ένα γαμοπιστοποιητικό γέννησης (είπαμε : δεν υπάρχει για το Αμερικάνικο κράτος) και μπαίνει πρώτη φορά σε αίθουσα διδασκαλίας στα 17 της. Μέχρι τότε αγνοεί την διαφορά κρατών και ηπείρων (η Ευρώπη είναι χώρα ;), ακούει πρώτη φορά την ΛΕΞΗ ""Ολοκαύτωμα"" στα 17 της, δεν ξέρει να διαβάζει ένα βιβλίο (της συμβουλεύει μια συμφοιτήτρια ότι δεν πρέπει να κοιτάει τις εικόνες αλλά το κείμενο !), για αυτή φανταστικά πρόσωπα όπως ο Γιάννης Αγιάννης και ιστορικά όπως ο Ναπολέων είναι το ίδιο. Κι όμως. Όχι απλά περνάει στο Πανεπιστήμιο,αλλά μετά από ένα ατυχές κόψιμο στα Μαθηματικά στο πρώτο εξάμηνο, πρέπει να γράψει perfect score για να διατηρήσει την υποτροφία. Με διάβασμα 3 εβδομάδων γράφει 100/100 σε πανεπιστημιακό επίπεδο, ενώ πριν 1 χρόνο, δεν αναγνώριζε τα σύμβολα των μαθηματικών πράξεων. Γίνεται δεκτή σε ένα πρόγραμμα ως επισκέπτρια στο Κέμπριτζ με υποτροφία του Ιδρύματος Μπιλ Γκέιτζ, και ο επιβλέπων καθηγητής της στο Κέμπριτζ της λέει ότι ήταν το καλύτερο ""essay"" που διάβασε ποτέ, ενώ ένα χρόνο πριν, δεν ήξερε καν τι ήταν το essay, γιατί υποτίθεται το διδάχτηκε στο Λύκειο, ενώ ντράπηκε να πει ότι δεν πήγε ποτέ στο Λύκειο. Ακολουθεί αποφοίτηση, Κέμπριτζ ως μεταπτυχιακή, Παρίσι, Χάρβαρντ. Παίρνει το Phd στο Χάρβαρντ ακριβώς στα 10 χρόνια ενώ πρωτομπήκε για πρώτη φορά σε σχολική αίθουσα στο μορμοπανεπιστήμιο.Αγνοώ το αμερικάνικο σύστημα εκπαίδευσης, αλλά η ιστορία μπάζει από παντού. Διάβασα σαν μανιακός μονάστερες κριτικές (που δεν συγκεντρώνουν καν στρογγυλό ""1%"" του συνόλου των 360.791 κριτικών, ενώ 2 αστέρια συγκεντρώνουν ""1%""), αλλά όλες λένε ότι δεν θα μπορούσε να γίνει με τίποτα (υπάρχουν βέβαια και οι μονάστερες κριτικές που βαθμολογούν με 1 αστεράκι γιατί απλά ήταν πολύ λυπητερό για τα γούστα τους, fuck logic). Δεν μπορείς απ'τα 16 σου να αγνοείς τον κόσμο, και στα 17 σου να είσαι σε Πανεπιστήμιο και να έχεις περάσει εισαγωγικές εξετάσεις...Αγνοούσε τον κόσμο η μικρή Μορμόνα όπως λέει σε σημείο που να μην ξέρει που είναι η Γαλλία; Ήταν ο πατέρας της ΤΟΣΟ survivalist όπως λέει ; The facts , please, όπως τα παρουσιάζει η ίδια η μάρτυς στην κατάθεση της, κύριε Εισαγγελεύ : είχαν τηλεόραση, σταθερό τηλέφωνο, κινητό, αργότερα τοποθετήθηκε ίντερνετ, αρκετά αργότερα η μητέρα της διηύθυνε μια εταιρία εκατομμυρίων με μαντζούνια, ενώ από μικρή πήγαινε σε χορωδία (και εκεί ιδιοφυΐα : με το που άνοιξε το στόμα της, κατουρήθηκαν όλοι από το ταλέντο της), έπαιξε το πρωταγωνιστικό ρόλο σε μιούζικαλ, το Άννυ. Οπότε κάπου δεν μας λέει καλά, η μικρή Μορμόνα.Να τα ξεπεράσουμε όλα αυτά. Στο βιβλίο μέτρησα τουλάχιστον ΕΞΙ ΣΟΒΑΡΑ ατυχήματα. Τρία τροχαία, τρία εργατικά.

Μόνο στο ένα πήγανε τον αδερφό της στο Νοσοκομείο (ΦΑΙΝΟΝΤΑΝ ΤΟ ΜΥΑΛΟ ΤΟΥ), αλλά τελικά μάλλον δεν ήταν τίποτα, ώσπου να παντρευτεί, θα γιάνει. Σε όλες τις άλλες περιπτώσεις, δεν δόθηκε ΚΑΜΙΑ ιατρική βοήθεια, είπαμε ο πατέρας της δεν πίστευε στην δυτική ιατρική, οι γιατροί ήταν ""σοσιαλιστές"". Η ΠΑΣΠ των γιατρών πρώτη δύναμη στο ΕΣΥ του Αϊντάχο , σου λέει. Στο πρώτο ατύχημα, η μητέρα της παρουσιάζει το φαινόμενο ""μάτια ρακούν"", που ασυνείδητα την κορόιδευαν τα παιδιά της, ενώ υπάρχει αντ��στοιχος ιατρικός όρος. Ήταν σημάδι κρανιοεγκεφαλικών κακώσεων.

Αποκορύφωμα είναι ότι ο πατέρας της καίγεται σοβαρά στο κάτω μέρος του προσώπου, και στα χέρια. ΕΧΕΙ ΚΑΕΙ Ο ΦΑΡΥΓΓΑΣ ΤΟΥ. Την καλούν εσπευσμένα από το Πανεπιστήμιο γιατί περιμένουν ότι θα πεθάνει. Μαντέψτε, επιζεί έστω και παραμορφωμένος, ενώ η μητέρα της παρακαλούσε τηλεφωνικά να της στείλουν έναν ορό από το Νοσοκομείο. Ο γιατρός αρνείται την ευθύνη, τους λέει όμως ότι θα στείλει ελικόπτερο να τον πάρει. Αρνούνται. Τα ατυχήματα είναι τόσο σοβαρά, που δεν θα επιζούσε άνθρωπος. Μαντέψτε πως επέζησε ; Σε όλα τους χορηγήθηκαν κάτι μαγικά ""έλαια""της μητέρας της που έφτασε να γίνει εταιρία εκατομμυρίων. (Έχουν και σάιτ : της κακιάς ώρας, αλλά υπάρχει, και στο μεταξύ έχουν γίνει εκατομμυριούχοι με πολλούς υπαλλήλους). Η μικρή Μορμόνα ενώ μας πρήζει με την αξία της εκπαίδευσης, αδυνατεί να δώσει μια λογική εξήγηση : disclaimer επί disclaimer, υποσημειώσεις επί υποσημειώσεων με διαφορετικές ""εκδοχές"" των γεγονότων από τα άλλα αδέρφια της , μόνο όμως ως προς τα περιστατικά αυτά καθεαυτά, χωρίς όμως να αμφισβητείται το μέγεθος των βλαβών, και ότι δεν δέχτηκαν μετά ιατρική βοήθεια. Ώστε η δύναμη της πίστης, Τάρα; Η γιαγιά της που πίστευε στην δυτική ιατρική πέθανε από καρκίνο, ενώ όλοι οι άλλοι επέζησαν.Ναι, γιατί αν και η συγγραφέας, δεν αρνείται ευθέως τον μορμονισμό (πρώτη πρόταση στον πρόλογο), ούτε και αμφισβητεί ευθέως τα μαντζούνια της μητέρας της. Πως επέζησε επί μεγάλο διάστημα με σάπιο δόντι ενώ αρνούνταν να πάει σε οδοντίατρο ακόμη και να πάρει ένα απλό αναλγητικό ; ""Συνήθισε ο εγκέφαλος της στον πόνο""; Αλήθεια;Και εκεί που νόμιζα ότι όλο το βιβλίο ήταν ένας υπόγειος ύμνος στα μαντζούνια της μάνας της και στον μορμονισμό (""Όσο διάβαζα για την διατριβή μου, είχα ανακαλύψει έκπληκτη απόηχους από την θεολογία των Μορμόνων στους μεγάλους φιλοσόφους του δέκατου ένατου αιώνα""-όχι κούκλα μου, το αντίθετο μπορεί), φτάνει το τρίτο μέρος , που είναι γιγάντιο κατηγορώ και εξποζέ του ενός αδερφού της (που την χτυπούσε μικρή, ή εγώ μέτρησα 1-2 φορές), της αδερφής της , και τον γονιών της που δεν πήραν ποτέ θέση υπέρ της σε αυτό το θέμα. Αυτό τελικά την έκαιγε : όχι η στέρηση της εκπαίδευσης, αλλά το ότι δεν την συμπαραστάθηκαν στο θέμα του αδερφού της. Όλο το βιβλίο ήταν ένα γιγάντιο ""love me, oh love me "" προς τους γονείς της με τους οποίους διέκοψε οριστικά σχέση. Συνεχή ταξίδια μπρος και πίσω ενώ ήταν εμφανές ότι ήθελε την αγάπη τους. Να μην κάνω λίγο και εγώ τον ψυχολόγο εκ του προχείρου; Αυτή στο ΠΡΩΤΟ μάθημα ψυχολογίας στο Πανεπιστήμιο αναγνωρίζει διπολική συμπεριφορά στον πατέρα της.

Sure the brother parts I'd say she 'survived' but what was the rest of the BS? First off she says she grew up on the mountains and her whole family were cut off from the outer world/ didn't trust the government blah blah blah. Okay, but they had a TV? A phone, a computer, and internet too? She also had her own cell phone? Her mama used to write emails and stuff and the dad had a favorite TV show too? Am I dumb or is that the opposite of 'we don't trust the government'? And sure I get her father was strict and he was but except for the initial time she said she wanted to go to college he never really said no to anything? And almost all his children went to college and he did help with the money (well as much as he could) and also visited Tara soooo like... ?They were apparently 'poor' but she lived in a good house, managed to go to singing and dancing and piano lessons? And at one point her mama's essential oils (God I hate these words eSeNtIAl oILs) were such a hit a company offered to buy them for THREE MILLION DOLLARS? Tf?And I'm really really sorry but I just don't understand how a person who has never gone to a school (never studied at home either) lands herself to a local University then to Cambridge then another University in Paris and then to Harvard? I mean I'm not doubting her intellectual ability she could be the next Einstein or whatever but that I mean..???And the family was so sloppy I thought I'd lose my mind if I read 'This might be __'s last time/they might not make it ' They had so many fatal accidents yet never went to the hospital and were apparently 'cured' by good ol' salve and essential oils? How do you treat a brain injury with salve and essential oil? And oh my goodness tf was this guy Shawn? He brings a blade covered with a dog's blood and gives it to his sister and the family says he 'didn't mean it'? I realize that I'm very harsh in this review but man I can't stand BS."
80,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59568642-kevin-kuhn,Rating 4 out of 5,"I love a book where the intelligence and personality of the author shines through the prose. This is one of those books. That the story itself is about her upbringing by survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, who were isolated from mainstream society, makes her writing all the more intriguing. She was homeschooled (sort of) and raised in a household where a women’s place was in the home and history books were not to be trusted, yet she somehow makes her way to BYU, and then Cambridge where she earns a PhD in history.This is a must-read story. You’ll probably find yourself angry, heart-broken, amazed, and most certainly frustrated as you listen to her journey. Dr. Tara Westover is brutally honest, about her family, herself, and her story. Despite tragedy, prejudice, and abuse, she confesses a deep connection to her family. The pull of her previous way of life, and the mountain she grew up at the base of, are a looming presence even as she reaches illustrious heights beyond her rearing.I don’t often read memoirs, but this is a most unusual life and a tragic and beautiful journey. The writing is authentic and insightful. It’s also a revealing look at the impact of family and the hardships of transforming out of one’s upbringing into a better life."
81,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow, what a memoir!! This is one of the best, if not THE BEST I've ever read. With the exception of the first 15 pages when I felt a bit all over the place, Educated kept me enthralled through each and every page and I only wished I could read faster, so drawn into Tara Westover's story was I. I just wanted to swallow every word, find out more and more and more of this exceptional young woman.I think most people would be utterly shocked by Tara Westover's childhood, find it almost unbelievable. She was born to parents who held a deep distrust of the government and all who did not share their fundamentalist religious beliefs, such as that we are living in the End Times, or ""End of Days"". They didn't believe in medical care; indeed, more than simply not believing in it, thought that doctors and medications are part of a government conspiracy. Vaccines, antibiotics, prenatal care, hospitals…. All were part of some plan to lead the world to Satan. When Tara and her siblings and father received unimaginable injuries, from broken bones and concussions to severe and life-threatening burns, they were told to rely on God to heal them through their mother's use of herbs or other strange (to most of us) tactics such as energy healing or imagining oneself well. Tara's father was mentally ill and volatile, her mother timid and docile, succumbing to her husband's every wish and demand. Tara's older brother, having sustained severe brain injuries that went untreated, became extremely abusive to Tara and other siblings, whilst their parents turned the other way.Tara's family, in their fear and distrust of the government, thought that public schools were evil conspiracies to lead children away from God. They kept all of their children at home, giving them the barest minimum of an education -- they were taught to read, had one history book and one children's science book. Despite this lack of education or access to schooling, Tara developed a deep love of learning and an insatiable hunger for knowledge that led her to acquire an ACT study guide to teach herself enough English and mathematics to be accepted into college. She applied and was admitted to BYU, later winning a coveted position at Cambridge, followed by Harvard. It is fascinating how she found the resolve and discipline to go from the junkyard she was raised in to these prestigious schools, getting more of an education than most people do, in spite of her background and despite her parents' discouragement at just about every step of the way.Tara writes with brutal honesty, without ever seeming self-pitying or as though she's merely trying to gain pity from others. She writes beautifully and descriptively, poetically; she shares the horrors of her childhood and the pain she has suffered, but also relates how she has overcome the many difficulties she has faced in her life. I absolutely loved this book, perhaps partly because I can relate to much of it, having had a similarly bizarre childhood. Tara's childhood, unfortunately, is not unheard of in the USA. I partially blame the government, for not protecting ALL its citizens. The government protects parents' freedom of religion whilst denying children freedom from their parents' religion . From denying them vaccines and medical care, to denying them an education, parents are usually given a green light to infringe upon the rights of the children. Part of what needs to be done in this country is to insist that every child receive an education that meets high standards. If parents want to ""home school"" their children or send them to 15-student Christian schools where the kids just ""teach"" themselves (both of which were my ""education""), they have to pass strident tests to ensure the children are getting an appropriate education that will allow them to compete with more conventionally-raised people. To be sure, our public school system isn't that great either, but at least it is better than what most homeschooled children receive. Parents are neglecting their children by keeping them segregated from the rest of the world and by not giving them an education. This should be illegal and our government needs to stand up for the rights of each child. Many times reading this book, I felt thrown back into my own chaotic childhood, saw myself instead of Tara. In a sense it was cathartic to read this memoir. Having also been told I had the devil in me, was demon-possessed, I had chills when I read Tara's words, 
""What my father wanted to cast from me wasn't a demon; it was me.""
 I never thought to put it into words like that. Wow! I find those words very empowering though I'm not sure I can explain just why.I have the utmost admiration for Ms. Westover, in the life she has made for herself, the education she has acquired, and both the strength she found to look openly and honestly at herself, and the courage and strength to heal. To find herself amidst the junkyard of her childhood memories, to strip away all the ugliness and pain. To find the strength to separate herself from a family who is toxic, and allow herself to flourish and grow, and become the remarkable, intelligent, and highly educated woman she is. 
""You could call this selfhood many things. Transformation. Metamorphosis. Falsity. Betrayal. I call it an education.""
Kudos to you, Tara Westover!"

83,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/154417108-dez-the-bookworm,Rating 5 out of 5,"What an interesting memoir. This book had me sucked in from page 1…The author has an excellent writing style that captures and keeps your attention from cover to cover. I was not left bored or wondering when it was going to get better for a single page. For a child who was uneducated and educated herself into college, she mastered storytelling. The story itself is about her life and those closest to her. Brought up living in the mountainside by religious and survivalist parents, we follow Tara’s journey at discovering her world as it was presented…and then as she unraveled it as it really was. I was shocked more than once and the experiences she had are jaw dropping at times. This book reads as an eloquent blend of novel and memoir, full of rich descriptors. It transported me to her experiences and it left me thinking about the book well after I’d finished reading. If you like non-fiction that reads like fiction but doesn’t lose the authenticity of a memoir, this is a good choice. It’s an emotional read with tragedy and resiliency. It’s both heart wrenching and heart warming, and everything in between."

Y sobre todas las cosas, la educación no es solo cuánto sabes sobre filosofía, arte, literatura, matemáticas, biología, historia, etc. La educación es también saber crear seres humanos que puedan convivir con los demás en armonía, personas que desde casa se forman para ser empáticas y respetuosas con el otro, para comprender que no eres tú contra el otro por más que seas y pienses diferente.Esta historia de vida demuestra que la educación es tan importante como para no utilizar a tu Dios, a tu religión y tu fe como una excusa para hacer uso de tu ignorancia, de tu negligencia parental, de tus comentarios misóginos, de tu paranoia y delirios envueltos en un fanatismo exacerbado que afecta a tu familia y a tus hijos; a los cuales por medio de teorías conspirativas no los registras en su partida de nacimiento, no los dejas que interactúen de manera sana y cordial con la sociedad y tampoco dejas que se eduquen, que aprendan, que vayan a una escuela o que vayan a un hospital cuando son heridos por tu misma culpa, ya que no confías en el Gobierno y aseguras con convicción que el Fin del Mundo está cerca y que los Illuminati solo te quieren reclutar entre sus filas.Una educación es un libro que duele, que agobia, que entristece y que por encima de todo también enfurece. Pero lo que avergüenza y afecta del libro es ver a un padre que empuja a sus hijos siempre al peligro constante de perder alguna extremidad o sufrir algún accidente, ver a un padre que los condena a la ignorancia por medio de la manipulación y excusándose en su religión, un padre que permite que uno de sus hijos haga uso de su machismo y misoginia para violentar de manera sistemática y continua a sus hermanas y parejas.La historia de Tara Westower me hizo darme cuenta de lo completamente afortunado que soy al poder acceder a la educación y de tener a unos padres que me apoyan ya no solo económicamente si no también a nivel emocional. Y es que la conclusión de su historia, luego de que pudo aprender, saber y entender cuando accede a la educación a la que ella misma ha podido sumergirse allá fuera, lejos del ambiente opresivo, asfixiante y abusivo de su entorno familiar... es cuando descubre lo más sencillo y también lo más complejo de su historia de vida: debe y es necesario romper lazos con integrantes de la familia que a la larga solo te hacen daño y no reparan tus carencias afectivas y tus consecuencias psicológicas por el maltrato recibido durante muchos años."

The book is split into three parts: growing up and her childhood; College, predominantly at BYU; and, further education and the cracking of familial relationships. This book, I found, was largely an exploration of her familial relationships and the empowerment of education.This memoir starts off in Bucks Peak, where Tara grows up on the mountain, which was presented as very picturesque in writing. Without seeing pictures of the place, you could imagine the junkyard Tara use to play and work in, the animals roaming the sides of the mountain, her numerous siblings all playing around and living under her father's roof. Tara's father is a prominent figure in this memoir; a fundamentalist Mormon, he teaches the Mormon book as gospel and is incredibly strict in his teachings. He also states how he receives messages from God and all events in the world are leading up to The End of Days, the end of the world and so he ruthlessly enlists the help of his children and wife to prepare for this impending doom (this includes storing food and trying to dig a waterline into the mountain). Besides these views of grandeur, her father is also manipulative and often deceitful to achieve what he wants. He also has a very misogynistic view of what women should and shouldn't be, how they should dress, etc.Throughout childhood you see Tara complying with these ideals (for example, judging women on the length of their skirts if they are above the ankle). She doesn't know any other way of thinking or critical thought as this is the only way she has been taught to think. She never attends school and is taught to reject societal conventions and to judge others who are unlike her, to see them as wrong.Tara also has to deal with an abusive and dangerous family member. He is incredibly manipulative and deceptive and uses violence. Through this book I felt so sorry for Tara but exceedingly frustrated at her. You watch her journey through self doubt and self blame, and even when she does accept it... her family members turn a blind eye, which angers me. These parts of the book were uncomfortable to read.It was a game, he says.... Could he not tell he was hurting me? I don't know. I just don't know.Through attending BYU and onto Cambridge for her doctorate, you find Tara developing as a person, but also admitting the strain between her life on the junkyard and her life at prestigious institutions in education. The gap between family and education broadens and conflicts her mind. Through education, she was empowered and her transformation was courageous. She is absolutely remarkably smart despite the containment of her family values causing her severe mental health problems. She develops critical thinking and analysis of her own life, freeing herself from the confines of her father's teaching. The great thing about this book is that, despite her conflicts with certain family members, she was able to develop and create new familial relationships with others, leading to loving and trusting relationships.This book was lyrical in prose and read as incredibly smart. From the outset you can see how smart and curious Tara was and is as a person. This book held the qualities of being heart-breaking and uplifting, but mostly exceedingly frustrating. This frustration was not from the writing but my anger of how people can react to someone admitting that they were/are a victim of abuse. This was a remarkable story to read and Tara is an incredibly courageous and resilient person. There were days when the more I doubted my own sanity,the more violently I defended my own memories, my own ""truth"".On a side note: this was a copy I obtained from the library signed by the author, Tara Westover. I am so sad I have to hand this copy back!"
86,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18383778-dolors,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is a brutal account of a young woman who is forced to let go of her former self in order to survive. Funnily enough, Tara Westover was born into a family of radical Mormons who had been getting ready to survive “the Apocalypse” and it turns out that her only chance at living her life is getting away from them.I would have never thought that I would be so immersed in a memoir where religious fundamentalism is at the core of a very strict, violent and almost deadly upbringing. The portrait Westover paints not only of her dysfunctional family but also of her community is distressing to the point of disbelief. How can a rational, healthy person feel the need to belong to a family where physical and psychological abuse is condoned, even encouraged, by her own parents? How can a mother partake in the obsession of her husband to put in continuous danger the lives of her children relying on the will and the grace of God?Westover’s chronicle of her childhood is full of terrifying statements. The extreme conservationism of her father’s observations about the role of women, the degradation she suffers in the hands of her own brother, her mother’s apparent lack of empathy. As I kept reading I thought it couldn’t get any worse, and yet it did. Illness and severe accidents were treated at home with oils and herbs because their father didn’t believe in medicine nor in public education. So Tara Westover managed to self-educate herself in order to be admitted to college, and later to graduate in no other place than Cambridge.Tara’s courage is admirable. Not only for what she managed to accomplish in spite of her adverse upbringing, but also because she dares to talk about her childhood knowing she’ll be banned for good from her family. There is no rage or vindication in her words, mostly undeserved guilt and sorrow for the loss of innocence. Getting an education should imply growing in awareness of the world that surrounds us, it should arise countless questions that challenge the way we understand ourselves, it should broaden one’s mind. It shouldn’t mean losing a part of yourself or renouncing to one’s past, as it happened to Tara, it should bring collective enrichment and joy to you and those who love you.As the memoir run its course and was nearing its end, a tremendous sadness engulfed me. I was holding my two months old baby daughter in my arms and I couldn’t come to terms with the fact that a mother could deny her own daughter because she had expanded her worldview. Tara never imposed on her parents, she was always respectful, even reverent of their beliefs despite the trauma they inflicted on her, and it is unbelievable to me that she was so cruelly banished from everything she had loved as a child.Fundamentalism of any kind is our worst enemy and it’s painful to see how present and persistent it still is in the 21st century. Persons like Tara help us to remember how lucky we are to be born where we were, and to never take anything for granted. And to cherish education, which is and always will be our wings to fly up to higher perspectives. And what a vista… Scary, but so so necessary. A book I would recommend to anybody who thinks otherwise. I was provided with a free copy from the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."
87,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5505587-walter-ullon,Rating 1 out of 5,"This book is filled with way too many ""WTF Tara?"" moments for me to give it a high rating. Imagine for a second that you have this friend who dresses very conservatively, displays thrifty behavior, is always talking about struggling to make ends meet, and then one day says to you: ""So, wanna come ride around in my Ferrari this weekend? We can chill in my Chelsea penthouse after, IDK."" Huh? This is how the entire book was for me, in a nutshell. Supposedly, the Westovers are these hardcore ""off-the-grid"" survivalists: self-sufficient, god-fearing luddites that despise the government and all it stands for. At least enough to stockpile gold, silver, ammo, canned goods, fuel, bibles and other assorted fiction, ointments and essential oils, and more in order to prepare for the end-of-days. Yeah, essential oils, they were going to run an MLM scheme from their bunker... So, for a minute you buy the story because, through the vehicle of descriptive writing, Tara Westover reels you into her childhood world where you are left with very little choice but to sympathize with her plight. She loves her family and she is so uneducated that...whatever.  But then, casual as all hell, she drops bombs like ""well, I just pulled out my cellphone to call father..."" TARA! WTF? YOU HAD A CELLPHONE THE WHOLE TIME?!?! And ""so I sat down at the family computer to look at them classes in university..."" YOU HAD INTERNET TOO?!? And then, there's the gaps. She goes from not knowing Europe wasn't a country, having no clue of the location of France, not knowing you have to actually read a book and not just look at the pictures (while actually in college, I kid you not!), and never hearing about the Holocaust somehow, to being accepted to Cambridge under a prestigious and highly competitive program where she impressed everyone by being the best thing since cucumber sandwiches. I'm not saying it's impossible, but please elaborate. Did you just take a trip to Oz where the wizard gave you a brand new brain Tara? Ugh. It's a bit exasperating when by way of unearned facts, you break the spell midway through the book and force your readers to walk over the shards; It's not fun.I looked forward to reading this one for a long time but, unfortunately, it's incongruous AF. Cannot recommend."
88,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25976435-tudor-queen,Rating 5 out of 5,"This memoir by Tara Westover has overwhelmed me. There is a LOT to digest here. You will be shocked and horrified by many of the stories you read here about the family Tara grew up in. Ironically enough, you will also be in awe and have a grudging respect and appreciation for other aspects of these characters. As I mentally recount the many stories Tara shared of her family, it's staggering to realize that this all really happened. There were many times I felt like grabbing Tara and shouting at her to stop going back home. Again and again she put herself in such danger simply by being in her family's presence. Tara Westover was born in 1986 in Buck Peak, Idaho to devout fundamentalist Mormons living off the grid. They distrusted the government and guarded their privacy. This sentiment became increasingly hardened when they hadn't even reported the births of the last four of their seven children. They used midwives when giving birth to stay out of the hospitals, another entity of which they held a deep distrust. Her parents believed in trusting God to heal all illnesses and injuries. To that end, the Mom became immersed in creating tinctures, salves, poultices and other natural remedies over the years to treat any and all ailments. This was taken to a mind-numbing extreme when there were car accidents, burnings, brain injuries and other health crises for which the average human being would call 911 for a heart-racing trip to the nearest hospital. The children were also home-schooled to maintain control over them and keep them available for working on their property. Through years of Tara's father's religious mania and indoctrination, and various forms of mental and physical abuse from a male sibling, Tara triumphed to acquire her independence and a doctorate from Cambridge University. This is an utterly riveting real-life story of a remarkable young woman.Thank you to the publisher Random House who provided an advance reader copy via NetGalley."

I feel that there is something missing though. I still don't understand how she did it. I know she has ambition and is clever, but it still begs the question, how? The chapters in her college years are too hurriedly gone through. I needed more information there.I think she grew up in such an uncomfortable, uncompromising environment that anything would have been better, maybe. Perhaps those who are used to no support from their parents, either emotionally or materially, have nothing to lose. it was not only neglect, but active endangerment in the case of her father. He is a reckless, foolhardy man. She also had a malignant, violent brother to contend with. Her parents and vile brother are not dead, but they are to her. All in all, a wondrous achievement on her part."

91,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was one of my favorite memoirs of 2018. Tara Westover was burn in rural Idaho to highly religious parents. The exact date of her birth isn't known -- no one bothered to write it down, apparently. Her parents didn't believe in doctors or public schools, so she was intermittently homeschooled and any ailments suffered were treated by her mother, usually with oils and homemade tinctures.That setup -- extremely religious parents, no medical care, no structured schooling -- combined with violent and abusive relatives, created a childhood for Tara that was so shocking I often had to pause the book and marvel that she survived. I grew to despise her mentally ill father, who was so reckless he repeatedly endangered his entire family, and Tara's violent older brother, who was a sadistic asshole.At this point, you might wonder how such a horrific tale could become one of my favorite books. It's because of how Tara turned her life around. She was inspired to escape her crazy family and go to college, so she asked a friend to tutor her and she studied hard for the ACT exam. She was eventually accepted to Brigham Young University, where she had a crash course in the outside world. For example, Tara didn't know that Europe wasn't a country, or what the Holocaust was, or have any understanding of the Civil Rights movement. She realized the truth about some of the lies her father had been telling her, including exaggerated stories about the Ruby Ridge standoff, or her father's paranoia about the government and the medical establishment.Tara learns how to be a good student, and she gets mentored by a few professors who see her talent. She ends up studying at both Cambridge and Harvard, earning a Ph.D. in history.Tara is a gifted writer, and despite the incredible amount of trauma she suffered, this is a beautiful book. Highly recommended.Meaningful Quote""I am only seven, but I understand that it is this fact, more than any other, that makes my family different: we don't go to school. Dad worries that the Government will force us to go but it can't, because it doesn't know about us. Four of my parents' seven children don't have birth certificates. We have no medical records because we were born at home and have never seen a doctor or nurse. We have no school records because we've never set foot in a classroom. When I am nine, I will be issued a Delayed Certificate of Birth, but at this moment, according to the state of Idaho and the federal government, I do not exist."""

This winds up with Tara believing that if her black toe is x-rayed and the x-ray shows that it’s broken, that will be because the x-ray machine broke it. So Tara grows up with her crazy off the grid daddy expecting the end of the world next month at the very latest and telling her that the US government is run by the Illuminati. The kids don’t have birth certificates and the parents guess vaguely how old they are. Tara’s family and her own brain is full of what Blake called mind-forged manacles. The family was nominally Mormon but really were a family cult based on Mom and Dad’s lunacy.Gradually Tara gets the urge for some kind of education. Strangely enough working 12 hour shifts in the scrapyard running forklifts and throwing huge lumps of metal into dangerous machines was unfulfilling for a 15 year old girl.I felt rising tides of queasiness as Tara Westover guided me through her stumbling, weird college career. She is constantly discovering chasms of ignorance within her. They told people she’d been home schooled but that really meant home neglected. So she had never heard of the Holocaust, Martin Luther King, civil rights – most of the common furniture of the American mind in fact. THE QUESTION OF BELIEVABILITYWe know there have been memoirs that were full of untruths – the poster boy here is James Frey and you have to admire his publisher – when they discovered his memoir A Million Little Pieces was a pack of lies they just rebranded it as a novel and carried on regardless. But the pressure is on us readers to believe the victim/author. How dare you think of not believing the victim? You would surely be colluding in the abuse she suffered! There were moments when my good angel turned green and flew away and my bad angel said – huh, a likely story, this could never have happened. I confess, there were several moments. Given all the cultish total ignorance of her first 15 years I couldn’t quite see how Tara could glide into college, get a degree, & then be wafted on clouds of intellectual admiration to Trinity College, Cambridge, England, no less, to do a PhD no less. That is the kind of vertiginous ascent a Cape Canaveral rocket would aspire to. But it seems that every tutor, lecturer or professor she encountered instantly perceived her excellent brain power and found a grant she could apply for and wrote a letter of recommendation to the next gilded seat of learning (ending in Harvard). ESCAPE FROM IDAHOTara at the university is like Dorothy in Oz, but this Dorothy feels like she has to go back to Kansas every summer for more scrapyard shifts. There’s a huge, longwinded and (so sorry!) tiresome battle with the family about her memories of maltreatment and violence at the hands of one brother, and this dominates the last third of the book. Since she no longer talks to her family you can see how that all panned out. I don’t know – this is a very uneasy book - I felt I was gawking at a roadside crash a lot of the time.FURTHER READINGAfter reading her daughter’s memoir, the mother decided to self-publish her own version , called Educating. Here is a great review of that by Edmund :https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...One of the brothers posted an Amazon review of Educatedhttps://www.goodreads.com/questions/1...And finally an excellent recent article on the Westover family here :(you have to google Deseret News ""What does Tara Westover’s family say about ‘Educated’?

94,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73431206-richard-on-hiatus,Rating 5 out of 5,"Tara Westover, the author of Educated, has led a strange and fascinating life so far.This autobiography is gripping, sad and full of real drama.Growing up with her siblings in an isolated homestead, under a mountain in rural Idaho, Tara is not permitted to attend school and has a sketchy view of the outside world. She has no birth certificate and is brought up very much ‘off grid’. Her father is a fiercely driven fundamentalist Mormon and pretty much a survivalist. He is distrustful to the point of paranoia of the ‘godless’ wider world and runs his family with a rod of iron and righteous cunning.The book chronicles Tara’s tough, self motivated journey into a world of study, eventually school and university and the amazing places it takes her, including her winning a place at Cambridge university (as mentioned in the book’s blurb)Educated is a well written book of struggle, of family, of faith and of the transforming power of education. Education massively widens Tara’s world and its possibilities, but can it fully heal the scars of a chaotic and abusive upbringing?Tara Westover will be speaking at the Hay literary festival this year - this is how I became aware of her book. I’ve got tickets ...... should be fascinating!"
95,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101358081-imme-van-gorp,Rating 4 out of 5,"|| 4.0 stars ||Wow, this was such a tragic story. I’m sure many would call it inspiring, but I cannot see it as anything other than tragic. I do not think Tara escaped her abusive family because of her strength. I think it was because she was lucky (relatively speaking, of course). She never had a very strong will, and would have given up plenty of times if it weren’t for other people around her helping her. She received many unorthodox favours and received much more help academically than most other people will ever receive. Her family also seemed to always have money to do and buy whatever was needed at the time, and she was actually granted quite a bit of freedom to explore her own education. Her environment seemed relatively tame compared to other radical survivalist families, and they even had copious amounts of modern technologies in their home! Almost no other people who are in positions similair to Tara (namely, children from insanely religious families) will ever be granted the opportunities she did, and will thus never be able to leave their abusive families like she did. Tara might have been lucky (again, relatively speaking), but many more are not: People who would be even more willing to denounce their families, to open their eyes to reality, still will never get the opportunity to escape. They are stuck in that Mormon “preparing for the End of the World” environment, unable to get out. They are stuck in that world of oppression and control. Worst of all, they will eventually repeat this abusive cycle when they have children of their own. It’s tragic. I honestly did not find Tara a very strong or inspiring person. She was easily influenced throughout the whole book, and even after having undergone years of education (and thus no longer having the luxury of blaming mere ignorance), she still refused to acknowledge the truths that were right in front of her. I think it is important to realise that she did not cut off her family; her family cut her off. This makes a big difference, in my opinion, because it shows that Tara still hasn’t understood the true horror and abuse her parents put her through. She would forgive them, especially her mother, if only they would forgive and accept her. Once again, I find this utterly tragic. The biggest tragedy of all, however, is that her family got away with it. In the end, her parents are happy, rich and thriving. They are seen as miracle workers, as the hands of God. They are never punished for their misdeeds and they are never held accountable. Not even Shawn faced any consequences for all the violence he has done. This injustice enraged me. I understand that this is the way the world works; monsters walk away scot-free, but damn if that isn’t tragic as all hell. While reading this book, I really kept wondering about one thing specifically: How on earth does one family undergo that many accidents? I want to believe it all truly happened that way (because I want to believe this memoir to be trustworthy), but I cannot help but wonder if some of it might have been exaggerated. It comes very close to being unbelievable. But if it did in fact happen, then I seriously have to wonder why the hell the police is not knocking down these people’s doors, taking them in for severe child-abuse and -endangerment (even if they are years too late)."

Surijau per tris paras, su tokiais mini pakvėpavimais, nes man vis dar sunku suvokti, kad tai ką perskaičiau yra realios moters realūs memuarai. Trumpiant tariant, šie 500 puslapių mane tiesiog uždaužė. Stipriais mostais, per galvą.Tara Westover yra Kembridžo ir Harwardo absolventė. Ji yra istorijos mokslų daktarė ir jai yra lygiai tiek pat metų kiek man. Tara gimė 1986-ųjų kažkada rugsėjį, niekas tiksliau nepamena, tėvas apskritai jos amžių vertino penkmečių tikslumu, o 7 šeimos vaikai neturėjo gimimo liudijimų. Surijusi pirmuosius 150 puslapių, vidurnaktį aš puoliau gūglinti, jūtūbinti ir kitaip ieškoti kas čia per 21-ojo amžiaus velniava. Peržiūrėjau Taros interviu CNN, perskaičiau jos pokalbius didžiuosiuose pasaulio žiniasklaidos gigantuose. Ji ramiu tonu prašo dėl jos istorijos nekaltinti mormonų religijos, esą blogų žmonių būna įvairiai tikinčių. Ir aš tikrai blaiviai suvokiu, kad radikalizmas gali teisintis bet kokiu dievu, bet kai perskaitai Apšviestąją, tai vistiek norisi galvą į sieną trankyti, nes mintis užvaldo vienas klausimas: kodėl? Šiuolaikinėje Amerikoje? Atsakymo į šitą klausimą neturi ir pati Tara Westover. Kažin ar kada turės, net nurimusi. Kažkuriame savo interviu ji sako, kad tokiose šeimose kaip jos - tiesos sakymas yra neatleistinas nusikaltimas. Nebijodama būti nusikaltėle, tiesą savaip suvokusi Tara Westover šiuo metu savo radikalių mormonų šeimos nematė jau keletą metų. Ir sako, kad su šia mintim jau susitaikė. O jos prisiminimai ir yra tas mane ištaškęs daiktas knygos pavidalu. Gimusi mormonų sirvivalistų šeimoje, Tara niekada gyvenime nelankė mokyklos (17 metų pirmą sykį įžengė į mokymosi įstaigą), nesikreipė į daktarus (tėvui tai buvo lygu dievo išdavimui, motina dirbo pribuvėja, rinko žoles ir šeimą gydė nuovirais), neturėjo ryšio su žmonėmis, neturėjo draugų, nebuvo mieste, iki šiol daug ko nesupranta pop kultūroje, jai nieko nesako muzikos grupės pavadinimas QUEEN, universitete ji nepagalvojusi paklausė kas yra Holokaustas, nes tėvas jai sakė, kad tai žydų sąmokslas prieš pasaulį. Tara su broliais dirbo tėvui priklausiančiame metalo savartyne. Ir nuolat ruošėsi pasaulio pabaigai - vien ko vertas faktas, kad jos beprotis tėvas kieme užkasė 4000 litrų degalų, nes artėjo 2000-ieji, o tai reiškė, kad mes visi mirsim. Išgyvens tik Westoveriai. Visa jų šeima nuolat patys save žiauriai žalojo fiziškai, Tarą psichologiškai, bet ir kumščiais sulaužė jos brolis. Tėvai ir jį teisino dievu. Skaitydama tas smurto kupinas scenas aš nesugebėdavau nekaltinti religijos, jaučiausi sukrėsta ir be proto gailėjau Taros. Kol ji nepabėgo ir nepradėjo mokytis. O tada ėmiau kaltinti ir ją pačią. Kai esi sveikas, niekaip negali suvokti fizinio ir psichologinio smurto suluošinto žmogaus atkritimų, neveiksnumo, baimių ir nuolatinio grįžimo ten, nuo ko taip stipriai bėgo. Aš purčiausi nuo momentinių šeimos švelnumo protarpių - dabar Tara ir pati sako, kad pamena ir gražių vaikystės akimirkų. Man nuolat norėjosi, kad Tara prieš smurtą ir pati imtų kovoti smurtu. Nes kiek galima?! Ir aš tą emocinę audrą baigiau. Šiąnakt. Ramiai padėjau knygą po lova ir nuėjau miegoti. Suvokusi, kad gal jau ir turiu savo mėgstamiausią 2019 metų kūrinį. Perspjauti bus sudėtinga. Dievas mato. A MUST, jei klausit.P.S. Man atrodo, kad toks knygos surijimo greitis priklauso nuo patogios jos struktūros. Westover neturėjo žalio supratimo, kas yra knyga. Ji mokėjo tik rašyti esė universitetui. Tokio tipo rašymo išmoko skaitydama New York Times fiction skiltį ir klausydama jų podcastų. Dėl to Apšviestoji yra krūva trumpų, bet į vieną sueinančių istorijų. Man tai naujiena ir įdomybė. Tikiuosi ir jums."

98,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30535238-brittany-mccann,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book was intense, and I found myself comparing it to the emotional state of Jeanette Walls as she wrote The Glass Castle and wondering how many other families live like this that we will never know because none of them ""escaped.""This book was able to resonate with me on somewhat of a personal level. I was raised LDS when I was younger, and my mother and I are both into energy healing and muscle testing to add to daily life. Tara's family may have been from the Fundamentalist offshoot of the Mormon religion due to the extreme strictness and beliefs toward even other Mormon worshippers. Add to that the religious zealotry and mental incapacities that existed in a survivalist situation. It is incredible that any child could detach from the brainwashing and abuse. Some of this book is awe-inspiring, but more of it is hard to read because you want to reach out and help Tara and her family. Religious beliefs separate my own family in some areas of life, and I can't imagine how hard it would be for Tara to make some of the decisions that she had to make and the way that we as humans retreat into ourselves to reach a survival mode and how easily that can become normal to us. Then with nothing to compare that to, it is hard to see that there is ever any difference in life. I applaud Tara for her bravery in sharing a story that is still emotionally painful for her and probably always on some level. I mean, how could it not? There were ""whispers"" of possibly worse abuse that I hope never occurred or that Tara has been able to heal from if they have. Worth a read to help try to understand the mindset of others and find empathy for them, as well as to put life and all we take for granted into perspective. Thank you for sharing your story with the world. 5 Stars for me."
99,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42219802-michelle,Rating 2 out of 5,"WARNING UNPOPULAR OPINION!Oh man I’m almost afraid to review this book because I KNOW that I am in the minority. I feel like this is a “Caraval” repeat all over again, but I am always 100% real in giving my honest opinions on what I’ve read, so here goes...This book is NOT about education as much as it is about Tara’s family and her upbringing. It shouldn’t be titled as “Educated” but rather “What an unbelievable life” or “The mistakes families make”...this was NOT a book based on being educated. Toward the end of this book Tara’s grandmother passes away ( This is not really a spoiler—she’s barely talked about in the book—) and she discusses that, “My father spoke at the funeral. His speech was a twenty- minute sermon on God’s promises to Abraham. He mentioned my Grandmother twice.” Well...that is exactly how I felt about this book...It is 300 pages about her family and MAYBE 30 pages thrown in about how she achieved her education. Tara had a very difficult life growing up and even as she got older it still continued and I feel extremely sorry for her. Not everyone is lucky enough to be born into a loving, accepting, empowering family. I am in no way saying that the abuse or negativity she was forced to endure isn’t valid or shouldn’t be written about, I just think that this book is marketed wrong. I wanted wayyyy more about how she made something of herself, much more information on the actual schooling. My feelings toward this book are that it was extremely repetitive and a bit unbelievable. The tragedies that she describes seem too far fetched to have actually happened without dire consequences...Especially with the refusal to go to doctors or hospitals. There were two major car wrecks, an entire leg with the flesh burnt off of it, a concussion, an entire body engulfed in flames, and everyone lived on happy go lucky after rest and herbal remedies. I’m not buying it.The statements that Tara makes are also very contradictory. Her family thought that going to the doctors or medical facilities of any kind would be an act of Satan , EXCEPT when Audrey needed a cast, EXCEPT when Peter needed multiple surgeries, EXCEPT when Shawn needed a CAT scan....doesn’t make much sense to me why sometimes it was okay to go and in what seemed to be much more drastic circumstances it was not?Also, in many conversations Tara adds a footnote at the bottom stating that the words have been paraphrased and are not exact. Why not write the exact words? Examples are emails with Audrey, emails with Shawn, and emails between her mother and Shawn’s ex, Erin. The same was true when describing numerous catastrophies that happened during work aka “ scrapping.” It is stated that her father was burnt horribly on a certain day, but then a footnote that the timeline may be off; Shawn’s concussion was described in great detail only to have another footnote that everyone in the family remembers this occurrence differently, and this may not be how it happened at all. Again...when Luke’s leg caught on fire we are told a story from Tara’s perspective only to find ANOTHER footnote that “ ...perhaps our memories are all in error...” Then..her brother Luke had a very distinguishable scar on his forearm from a shear...but no wait another footnote that it may not have been from that at all but rather from a roofing accident( I’m paraphrasing). What??????? I am so lost, is any of this book 100% factual or is this all a bunch of tall tales to make one hell of an interesting story? No clue.It was horrifying the way that both Shawn and her father treated her , as well as her mother and other family members turning the other cheek. They called her disgusting names like Wilbur the pig, their “ nigger”, wench, “eyes like a fish” and so much more. None of this is in any way excusable. However, knowing how hurtful words can be I would think that Tara would tread a bit lighter when describing her father’s smelly, rotting flesh or disgusting hands or even an innocent little baby, “ ...Shawn and Emily would bring home the Little twig of flesh that I was told was my nephew.” She treated all of her boyfriends poorly as well. I just can’t identify with Tara as a person at all.2 stars. I have zero clue how this book is so hyped up."

The decisions I made after that moment were not the ones she would have made. They were the choices of a changed person, a new self. You could call this selfhood many things. Transformation. Metamorphosis. Falsity. Betrayal. I call it an education.
Tara was never sent to school as a young child, in fact she went to school for the first time when she was 17. She grew up in Idaho and her parents were survivalists. Her Dad was convinced the government was out for them and her mom didn't believe in doctors or western medicine. Tara and her siblings lacked traditional education and learned to work in the (dangerous) family business. They relied heavily on their Mormon faith and left most of their fate up to God. Tara and her siblings experience abuse, dangerous working conditions, near death experiences and so much more. Until one day Tara wants to follow in the footsteps of her brother, Tyler, and go get an Education. From there, Tara learns about a whole different world she knew nothing about.I think it's hard to rate a memoir since it's someone's life story. How can you really rate them on it? You can't but what I did rate this on was the way Tara Westover wrote her story while holding absolutely nothing back. She gave us the good, bad and the (real) ugly. I cringed at times and I wanted to scream ""WHY"" at other times. I wanted to hug Tara and her siblings (except Shawn) and tell them there's something better. The journey and evolution of Tara and her life was truly incredible and I'm so happy she found her way. But no doubt that it was a very tough and dangerous road to get there.I hope everyone reads this book and see's it for what it is. It's a story of someone so sheltered and taught to think one way that it almost seems impossible to break out of the bubble. I think it's important to realize that even though it may not be a straight line to a new outlook that it can happen and it can be rewarding."

Raised on a mountain top in Idsho, by a survivalist father and midwife mother . Of the Mormon religion, her father preached the coming of the end days, intrusion by the government, built a bomb shelter, stockpiled fuel, food, guns. He ruled with an iron fist, the word of God and the family fell in line. Though there was another factor in her father's psyche that she wouldn't understand or figure out until much later. There were no doctor visits, no immunizations, no formal schooling, no friends other than family, so many things not allowed. They were in effect totally off the grid. Yet, somehow this young woman manages to educate herself, pull herself out of the morass of the paranoia her father fed on and used to control the family.When I read books like these, people despite all odds to the contrary that manage to overcome so much adversity and rise to meet and supercede lives challenges, I am awed. The things one reads in this book are unbelievable, difficult to assimilate, and yet they happened. The struggles that Tara had to overcome are written without excess emotion, though in her words you do realize just how hard this struggle was and is still. Her journey, not without many steps back, at times literally tore her apart. I always wonder why and how some people are able to pull themselves out and above these situations, while some cannot, as is apparent in her own family. Where do they find their strength of will? My first five star read of the year, and I have nothing but admiration and respect for this young woman, who is a formidable person indeed. I hope she continues to find the peace she needs, and is able to resolve her relationship with her family.ARC from Netgalley."

Tara Westover writes wonderfully about her childhood and growing up in a family with very radical thoughts on education and life in general. This is non-fiction, but Tara’s writing and dialogues are so vivid that I oftentimes had to stop up and remind myself that this was actually real. Meanwhile, Tara’s beautiful writing tells of some terrifying experiences she and her siblings have had which are just heart-breaking. Her parents didn’t believe in education, that’s one thing, but they also didn’t believe in hospitals or anything related to the government, making Tara’s mother a self-proclaimed healer and Tara not getting a birth-certificate until she was 9 years old! I’ve only told about the top of the iceberg; the rest is for you to discover for yourselves. All in all, even though I found this account scary, I also believe it to be very important and highly educating."

Though the story is often quite harrowing--shocking abuse, neglect, gaslighting, and plain old danger abound--it is Westover's persistence through adversity that makes the story shine. The memoir never feels vengeful nor does it wallow in past regrets. Instead, Westover's story is presented objectively as possible with some added help from old journals she kept while growing up.I think it's rather impossible to read (or listen) to Educated and not be moved by Tara Westover's incredible journey from an Idaho junkyard to the halls of Cambridge. I'd had this book recommended to me time and again, and my only regret is not having taken up the book at those first suggestions. In point of fact, I'm giving Educated my first 5-star review of 2019 (and the year's almost half-way through!). This is a powerful piece of work, highly recommended."

”I don’t understand why I wasn’t allowed to get a decent education as a child.”
 i was feeling second hand resentment towards her parents. i was angry and sad that a child had to ASK for a good education. it’s every parent’s job to give their kids a proper education. im so angry with their fucking ideologies!i know i’ve not gone through even 1% of what she has but i felt when she said ”Suddenly that worth felt conditional, like it could be taken or squandered. It was not inherent; it was bestowed.” this memoir deals with everything - family, trauma, childhood, adulthood, abuse, misogyny, sexism, breaking stereotypes and mentalities, importance of education, money etc. all i can say is that everyone needs to read this. every single person. i’m so glad that one day this book came on my feed and i clicked on it and added it to my tbr. i’m definitely going to read more of her work...any work!ps. please feel free to message/share some more memoirs related to this and if anyone has read this please feel free to share your opinion. i wanna read more memoirs!"

A quick scan of professional offerings repeatedly show Morman in the headlines yet while that is her family’s religious identity it’s not about how that particular belief system skewed their lives—people will use what they philosophically embrace to uphold their own desires or agenda and any faith tradition could be at the center of it. If your leader, in this case her father, is mentally unfit things are going to get ugly and painful for all involved including the reader. Nothing will embolden a compromised brain like religious scripture made to order.I come away believing that Tara Westover is a most courageous and fascinating woman. She did not write this to expose or hurt anyone although undoubtedly there is always another side to a story. I accept it as an unflinching confession of her journey between granite and a very hard and dangerous place—lose your mind or lose your family. That she does so without demeaning or demonizing those at the heart of her at times horrendous upbringing is admirable. A number of reviews state that her parents no doubt fervently love their children. Seriously? I cannot identify their actions with love. Her father and brother are no doubt bi-polar but how to settle with her mother’s lack of mama bear instinct? For me, a disturbing, briskly paced, emotionally gripping, yet ultimately inspiring memoir. I could not put it down except for brief periods of respite and recovery. Highly recommend and believe this would make for great book club discussion.Thank you to Net Galley and the publisher for this ARC."

Nonetheless, it takes a simple yet incredibly complex book to remind us that, even if we don't think about it every day, we are blessed just for being able to read it in the first place. To remind us, maybe, to be thankful for the things we take for granted.And I know this may sound trite, and may remind us our parents' words when we refused food (""think of all the children who are dying of hunger!""), which often had little to no effect; but really, it is astounding how easy it is, in our everyday life, to forget how much our security makes us take things for granted. “Curiosity is a luxury for the financially secure.” Reading a biography like this one, in which it's stated with such strength how much this woman had fought to grant herself something many of us had taken as an everyday occurrence: going to school, reading books, knowing about the world; reminded me not only to be thankful for what I had in my life, but also to never stop fighting to get what is my right to have. The struggle of a new adult going to college, with all the difficulties everyone faces, plus a myriad of additional challenges: having little to no cultural background; having suffered abuse an thus living in a constant psychologically challenged state; having no kind of moral or psychological support, neither from family nor friends; being an outcast everyday, everywhere; made me see my university years, during which I was struggling to work, study, pay the bills, all of which far from my family and in a bad relationship, in a different light.“I thought we were just supposed to look at the pictures.” This sounded stupid when said aloud.“So when the syllabus assigned pages fifty through eighty-five, you didn’t think you had to read anything?”“I looked at the pictures,” I said again. It sounded worse the second time.Vanessa began thumbing through the book, which suddenly looked very much like a textbook.“That’s your problem then,” she said. “You have to read the textbook."" I'm not saying I feel less worthy because my struggles were incredibly small, compared to the author's: I believe everyone's life is full of challenges and no one's problem is less worthy or less important just because ""someone has it worse"". On the contrary. This book made me feel more empowered, as an educated woman, as a woman, as a person. I read so little biography/memoir that I had to constantly remind myself, throughout the book, that what I was reading was a real person's life story. The lack of medical care, the abusive family, the absolute lack of help from any outside sources due not to evilness, but simple ignorance of the condition of a person who just couldn't ask for help. It all seemed so absurd and, often, enraging, that I just couldn't put this book down. Of course, reviewing someone's life is not as easy as reviewing a piece of fiction; but I believe this book was well-written, concise, straight to the point, and incredibly interesting. It was not only a portrait of an extraordinary life, but also a well-written piece of literature.  After closing it for the last time, I still have many questions in my head about our society in general, but I doubt I'll ever find an answer for many of them, and they may be just rhetorical questions. Like, for example: how is it possible that a person can legally refuse medical help, even when victim of third-degree burns and with a very high chance that he/she could die? Can a government really not intervene in a situation where there is a very high chance that someone will lose their life otherwise? How can a person reach 9 years of age without a birth certificate? How can a kid not go to school without any authority intervening? But also, more philosophically, how can a person whose abusive ""education"" has been intertwined with a distorted notion of God, still have faith after coming out of it? How can you still love your family (which you still do, of course, your dad will always be your dad even after all this), knowing they are responsible for so much abuse they left you crippled for life? I guess what this kind of books really give us when we read them, is the gift of thought. And this book really made me think, and will continue to do so in the future. Absolutely a must read."

Born to a father who was a religious extremist and believed he had to prepare his family for the end of days, she had no idea that her childhood was anything but normal. She loved the beauty of the mountains where they lived in Idaho but her father's paranoia about all government institutions meant that none of the children were vaccinated, saw a doctor or treated in hospital when injured. Although Tara's older brothers attended school, she and her younger siblings were 'home schooled' mainly learning to read from books of Mormon writings. Tara's birth wasn't even registered until she was nine and even then no one was sure of the exact date. Her mother, although from a mainstream family, was totally under her husband's rule and stockpiled bottled fruit and made herbal remedies to treat the many injuries experienced by her family, including broken bones, horrific burns and major head wounds. Many of the injuries were sustained in her husband's scrapyard where all the children, including Tara, were expected to work while growing up, cutting metal and car fuel tanks with no safety precautions at all. Tara's life was made an even worse hell by one of her brother's who would physically harm her if he felt she was stepping out of line. Somehow Tara survived all this and at the age of 17 decided to study for the college entrance exams and was admitted to Brigham Young University after her second attempt. When she started college, she realised how little she knew of the world - she'd never heard of the Holocaust, Martin Luther King or feminism and had no idea that Europe was more than a single country. That she eventually went on to earn a PhD from Cambridge and receive a fellowship from Harvard attests to the efforts she made to educate herself.Tara's memoir is simply and beautifully written. She writes of the effect that her education has had on her family, with them being in denial of her account of the terror she experienced at her brother's and father's hands. The resulting estrangement has clearly affected her and she describes having a breakdown after her parents made attempts to 'save' her and return her to the fold where she would be expected to work in her mother's herbal remedy business, listen to her father's diatribes and help him continue to stockpile fuel and food for the end of the world. She has the love and support of two of her brothers who have also broken away from the family and one can only hope this will be enough to help this tough woman start to heal mentally and forge ahead in her life.With thanks to Netgalley and Random House for a digital copy of the book"
112,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17957823-erin,Rating 3 out of 5," Thanks to NetGalley for an advanced ebook in exchange for an honest review. Okay, I will admit that I totally caved into  peer pressure  on the requesting of this ARC. A February 2018 publication, Educated has been probably the most chatted about memoir since  The Glass Castle  and it's definitely heating up my social media. Just a quick glance on Goodreads shows me that over 20+ of my friends have read the book and over 50+want to read it. As well, many of my non book reading friends haven't talked about a book this much since they told me about the ""greatest love story ever told"" which as we know was  Fifty Shades of Grey.( As an aside, I was finally driven to read it when I discovered my mother had bought a copy. There was no way I wasn't going to read it after that!) Because I didn't want to be labelled a  book snob, I decided to give this memoir my attention.  Tara Westover, you're a courageous lady to not only write(and re-live) the struggles of your life, but to publish it for the wide world- that takes real guts. My hats off to you because that cannot be easy for you or any other memoir writer. I felt it hard to read your story, often having to take breaks over the last two days to digest the contents, to connect with you was difficult, but I had to ultimately remind myself that this was your story, your truth, and if it provides you with some understanding or acceptance of what happened then I hope this book is only the start of a healing process. One that I know is a long road. Sometimes, I like to imagine after reading a book and turning to the reviews of the Goodreads community, that we are all sitting in a big room with a nice round table and now it's my turn to share.  Although as I write, I am not sure if this is exactly a review or I JUST CANNOT stop the words from coming out of my mouth. Haha! Thanks for a patient room!  For future readers, definitely give this book a shot-when you are ready. Personally, non fiction has always been a tough genre for me and memoirs are certainly a mixed bag. I find myself grounded at a 3 star review because I feel numbed out because of the aforementioned disconnection that I felt during my own reading experience. Isn't it strange for a person who only hears how emotionally sensitive they are in their own life experiences to not a shed a tear? Yes, seriously, I feel a bit jealous that this book has moved so many other readers and I am basically No Heart. Albeit, this is definitely a book that I will no doubt talk about when I do my Goodreads 2018 review. For a long time actually and most likely it is certainly a book that has left an impression. Perhaps in a week, a month, or even a year later, my rating will change, but for now I am going to let my Goodreads friend _____________ have their turn to talk at the table."

Sin embargo, a los pocos capítulos ya me tenía completamente atrapada a sus páginas y lo llevaba a todas partes para poder avanzar un poco más.Lo primero que me llamó la atención es que perfectamente puede ser leído como si fuera una obra de ficción, no porque lo que contara fuera increíble, sino más bien por el estilo. Sin ningún problema podría pasar por una novela escrita en primera persona y, de hecho, en más de una ocasión olvidaba que lo que estaba leyendo eran experiencias reales de la autora.Por supuesto, para nuestra cultura occidental contemporánea lo que se narra es realmente aberrante, pero creo que nadie tiene derecho a cuestionar la forma de vida que eligen llevar las personas, ya sea por ideales políticos, religiosos o lo que sea. Considero que el principal problema se produce cuando las relaciones, familiares en este caso, se transforman en enfermizas y se ejerce un mal entendido poder para controlar la vida de otras personas sin dimensionar el daño que pueden producir, sobre todo en la maleable mente de un niño/a.Al terminar la lectura me quedo con la sensación de que a pesar de todo lo que logró nuestra “protagonista” por absolutos méritos propios, es una persona que aún está muy dañada y que este libro es una forma de expiación o de justificar su accionar por un profundo sentimiento de culpa y pérdida que todavía la acompaña y que, sin duda, marcará toda su vida.Y es que a pesar del título y que se promocione como una oda a la educación y a la libertad de pensamiento, siento que lo que realmente hace la autora es una denuncia muy personal, una forma de alzar la voz, esa misma que siempre fue acallada y desmerecida por las personas que más le importaban y que debían protegerla ante las vejaciones de su hermano. Una denuncia que en su momento fue lo que realmente marcó el quiebre con su familia.Un libro muy, pero muy recomendable, muy bien escrito, que no deja indiferente y genera profundas reflexiones. Realmente me gustó.

A warning: if you plan to read EDUCATED, and you should, give yourself a good 30 min post-read to digest. You’ll need it. I’m still reeling, but in the best possible way. While Tara Westover’s tour de force has striking similarities to Jeannette Walls’ THE GLASS CASTLE, EDUCATED focuses more on Westover’s adult life. Her education, so to speak. Westover is raised in an off-the-grid farm by a self-proclaimed devout Mormon father and an herbalist mother. Quickly, it is apparent that Westover’s father isn’t self-reliant, but an unmedicated, mentally ill survivalist who lives in perpetual fear of the government. That fear results in  no medical treatment, no birth certificates, and no formal education. Or really, any education at all. The dangerous alchemy of mental illness paired with extreme religiosity defines Westover’s world. What’s particularly scary is how EDUCATED demonstrates how vulnerable children are to their parents (potentially) flawed belief systems. It took Westover years, plus college and post-grad education, to formally dismiss her parents values. And this is a woman who eventually goes to Cambridge and Harvard. She ain’t stupid. That’s the power parents have over their children. What a TERRIFYING prospect. In the spirit of honesty,  I have a fondness for inspiring stories in which people in horrific circumstances, rise above them and end up flourishing. That kind of resilience floors me. I had a perfectly normal childhood, and I’m not as successful as Tara Westover. On her isolated mountain top, Westover had no access to other worldviews. In one of her first college classes, she displays complete ignorance of the Holocaust. But with all Westover endures: severe injury, brutality, extreme poverty, she remains positive. Never does EDUCATED become maudlin. It rises above the typical, and becomes something else entirely. Extraordinary. Summary: READ. THIS. NOW."

I just got home after discussing it with a book group and the group was unanimous -- thumbs up all around. ""When life itself seems lunatic, who knows where madness lies.""Throughout her life Tara is seeking to reconcile the words of her father with what she is learning from the world. As she becomes more educated, she realizes that the girl she was on the mountain must be left there. Tara takes her journals from under her bed and leaves the mountain for good. Deals with some very difficult family situations honestly and with compassion. Highly recommended!"

TW: Dog harm/deathListening to ""Educated"" does not feel like listening to a memoir. Tara's childhood life was different from mine, her family was different, and it was very interesting to hear her story. Tara came from a Mormon family, she and her 6 siblings were homeschooled. They worked at their father's scrap yard while their mother was a midwife and also treated ailments with oils and herbal tinctures. At one point, her mother was the only midwife in a hundred miles. Tara's father raised them to be afraid of the federal government. How children will be brainwashed in schools or they could at any moment be shot or raided. They stockpiled food and ammunition.Tara took an exam and got into Brigham Young University (BYU) then went on to earn her master's degree from the University of Cambridge at Trinity College. This whole section was okay, not as riveting as it was in Buck's Peak, Idaho. At this point, I was leaning toward 4 stars...I started to search online after the dog slaughtering part which was really upsetting for me. I wanted to see ""Shawn"", the abusive brother. My search led me to interview articles that left me conflicted with it all. The joke is on me. I imagined the Westovers lives off-the-grid life in some kind of cabin or bunker-like home. No, they have a normal but large house and I mistook their essential oil warehouse for Home Depot. The Westover family has 3 children with doctorate degrees.Tara's sister Valaree or ""Audrey"" refuses to speak with Tara without a third party. She would do so through email with documentation of their conversation. Do you remember a memoir by a prince and his ""version of truth""? That appears to be the case here as well. As much as I enjoyed this book in the first half, it left me disappointed in the end. Perhaps one's memory can be a bit fuzzy. 2.5⭐*I didn't quite finish this book. I thought I'd continue the last hour but the following day, I had no desire to pick it back up and return it. DNF. 91%/11'ish hours."

While some are amazed that she was homeschooled (barely) and got into Harvard and Cambridge University, I felt that the no traditional medical treatment was far more staggering. Westover’s family didn’t believe in hospitals or modern medicine and her mother grew herbs and tinctures to treat illnesses and accidents. Her memoir is full of severe brain injuries along with parlous burns, all of which were successfully treated with homeopathic herbs.I enjoyed reading the story. It’s an engrossing and easy read. She diagnoses her father as having bipolar disease. From her writing, that isn’t the only mental issue he had. What I did enjoy is that she also includes other’s memories. She finds that her memories don’t always jibe with her sibling’s memories. For me, this gives her story more credibility. Memories are a funny thing, and she doesn’t suggest that her memories are the correct ones.I read this for book club, and everyone enjoyed this read. The fact that she made it out alive amazes me more than the fact that she got into college. I recommend this as an enlightening read of those who grow up in alternative (unconventional) lifestyles."
118,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6450088-tania,Rating 5 out of 5,"I am not the child my father raised, but he is the father who raised her.In the first section of the book we read about Tara's childhood set in the beautiful foothills of Buck's Peak, Idaho. Initially her upbringing sounds quirky - no birth-certificate, no schooling, not much in the way of hygiene. We soon realize that her dad shows signs of a mental illness - paranoia, depression, illusions of grandeur etc. The most shocking part of the book, is his total disregard for his family's safety, some of the injuries we read about are lost fingers, several cases of severe brain trauma, and two horrible burns. He believes that God will keep them save or miraculously heal them if necessary, no medical intervention needed. Her parents also allow one of her elder brothers to physically and emotionally abuse Tara and her sister, as they choose to believe that this is not happening. One of the things that works well in Educated is that Tara balances all these upsetting things with happier memories - her father allowing her to join the town's theater, and loving moments shared with her brothers. When her formal education starts we realize how isolated her upbringing was, she knows almost nothing about the world beyond her immediate community and her father's beliefs. As time passes she slowly assimilates into mainstream life, and starts to question elements of her childhood. When she raises this with her parents, and refuses to back down, they disown her. They also convince everyone, sometimes even her (and me), that her memories are false. So escaping and becoming educated, gave her a voice, which caused her to lose her family - something she is still struggling with. In an interview she says:  ...I realized I had reconciled with the things in my past that had been bad, but I don’t think I had reconciled with losing the things that had been good. I definitely recommend this well-written, thought-provoking memoir. The Story: Tara Westover had grown up in a family dominated by her father, a radical Mormon survivalist who was determined to keep his seven children out of the clutches of the government and the wider world. Officially the children were being “home-schooled”, but by the time Tara was eight, all pretense at formal lessons had stopped, and she was soon working hard in the family junkyard. She received her first taste of formal education at 17, she went on to earn a degree and a doctorate in history at the University of Cambridge."
119,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40997852-nicole,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book was impressive regardless of whether I think it’s completely authentic or not. It was interesting to read about Tara’s life and her family’s weird style of living and doing things. The violence she suffered was inexcusable and it saddens me to know her brother’s wife might be still violated.  The audiobook was nice to listen to and the narration was pretty good. So if you’re considering listening to the audiobook, I’m glad to report it was one of the better ones I’ve listened to.  I do however need to mention that I am skeptical of several incidents, like how they got into many accidents and rarely received any medical assistance yet her mother’s herbs were enough. I also think either Tara is a genius (and not just “very smart”) or her account on her schooling is not accurate. Education is a process that takes place across many years. Even someone smarter than average cannot pass such a test (while many others who went to school failed) having studied so little and only before the exam. I think she received more schooling than she claimed (or is a genius -I’m not an expert but she didn’t feel like one). She was also driving since at least 16, she never said anything about obtaining a driving license -as far as I know. Doesn’t she need official papers to do it?Still her story was powerful and worth reading even if her life in a Mormon family was more interesting to me than the education part."
120,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4876540-jonetta,Rating 4 out of 5,"the setup…Tara Westover is the youngest of six children born to Mormon survivalist parents from Clifton, Idaho who had strong ideologies and mistrust of anything associated with the government. She never went to public school and had limited teaching at home from one of her siblings and sometimes her mother. When she was 17-years old, she left her family home in the mountains of Buck’s Peak to enroll in Brigham Young University based solely on having passed the ACT tests with an exceptional score. She eventually earned a PhD from Cambridge University, having somehow earned scholarships, qualifying for grants and working to fund her education. But it’s her personal journey that preceded her education that is the strongest message of her story. the heart of the story…Tara’s father owned a scrapyard and all of the children were expected to help out, beginning at a young age and ending only when they left the mountain for other endeavors. It was dangerous work and her father didn’t seem to view safety as a priority. Tara’s mother was a midwife (unlicensed) and later became skilled in herbal healing remedies. There was little in the way of outside influences and Tara was almost an adult before she was exposed to anything other than her parents’ points of view. She describes events that I found heartbreaking, suffering physical and emotional abuse at the hands of one sibling who was allowed to continue doing so unchecked. Tara also believed her father had a mental illness, possibly being bipolar, and the behavior she described certainly seemed to fit that unofficial diagnosis. It was remarkable that Tara ever gathered the wherewithal or courage to leave her family and seek a formal education as her father had a dim view of schools at any level. But her biggest challenge took much longer to achieve, acknowledging that the only way to maintain any relationship with her family was by accepting that her truisms differed greatly from those of her parents but remaining silent about it. the narration…Julia Whelan, one of my most favorite narrators, delivered a powerful performance. She did this story justice, never embellishing the most difficult parts of Tara’s recollections, letting the eloquence of the words stand on their own. If you have a choice to read or listen, I’d go for the audio format. the bottom line…I delayed reading this book because I thought the emphasis was on how Tara developed a formal education and felt that might be a bit predictable. This was not that kind of memoir as I found her struggle for independence from her family, both in her thinking and physically, much more powerful. It defines her and every path she chose. While I’m still unclear as to not only how she was accepted into college but even made it through, I don’t question the abuse she suffered and the indifference to it by her parents. If I had any doubt about that, it was dispelled when her mother wrote her own book, leveraging the name of this one, not only victimizing her daughter again but presenting herself and her husband as being unblemished prophets. Whereas Tara changed the names to protect her siblings and never named her parents, her mother’s book took none of those precautions. It’s a difficult story I found thought provoking as I considered how much of my own truisms, initially formed by my parents, were reshaped as I was offered alternative points of view from the outside world and my own reaction to learning that Mom and Dad could be wrong. It’s a story I’d recommend you discover and judge for yourself.Posted on Blue Mood Café"

It must have been painful for Tara to re-live and organize all of her experiences into this memoir, but I got the sense while reading that it was therapeutic for her as well. I'd be interested to see what this would have been like if she had waited to publish after a few more years of distance, processing and hindsight. I don't know if the pain would be less acute then, but the ending of the book gave me the impression that her wounds were still very fresh and bitter, which probably colored her writing. I found the first half of the book slow but it became most engaging when, as an adult, Tara starts to realize that she's allowed to do what's right for her, despite pressure from so many other powerful, meaningful sources like family and faith. I'm about the same age as Tara and I can relate to reaching that point in my life, to questioning and examining my ""education"" and deciding what parts of it I can keep and what parts to let go of. She and I were both raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormonism), although I feel like I should point out that I've never heard anyone use the words ""Days of Abomination"" and our experiences can't really be compared. 😂 We have eventually ended up on different sides of that faith and that's okay because we've both done what has felt right for us.I thought her insights on guilt were particularly profound:
“That peace did not come easily. I spent two years enumerating my father’s flaws, constantly updating the tally, as if reciting every resentment, every real and imagined act of cruelty, of neglect, would justify my decision to cut him from my life. Once justified, I thought the strangling guilt would release me and I could catch my breath. But vindication has no power over guilt. No amount of anger or rage directed at others can subdue it, because guilt is never about them. Guilt is the fear of one’s own wretchedness. It has nothing to do with other people. I shed my guilt when I accepted my decision on its own terms, without endlessly prosecuting old grievances, without weighing his sins against mine. Without thinking of my father at all. I learned to accept my decision for my own sake, because of me, not because of him. Because I needed it, not because he deserved it.”
As much as I enjoyed her writing, and without meaning to discount her pain or experiences, I feel like I should comment that hers is one side of an account and should not necessarily be taken at face value. I'd be interested to hear her family's perspective.Posted in Mr. Philip's Library"

SUMMARYTARA WESTOVER never went to school, never saw a doctor and did not have a birth certificate. Her parents were Idaho survivalists, and wanted nothing to do with the government, schools or hospitals. She and her six brothers and one sister lived off the land. Her mother was a midwife and healer and treated every family malady—cuts, burns, broken bones, and head trauma— with herbs and oils. At age 10, Tara is put to work savaging scrap metal from her father’s junkyard, a dangerous job with no consideration to safety. When one of Tara’s older brother becomes physical and mentally abusive to her, her parents turn a blind eye. At fifteen, Tara begins educating herself. She learned enough math and grammar to pass the ACT and be admitted to Brigham Young University at the age of 17. There she studied history and learned of events such as the civil right movement and the Holocaust for the first time. From Brigham Young her quest continued at Cambridge and Harvard, ultimately earning a PhD at the age of 27. Throughout her education Tara Westover experiences tremendous conflict between the awareness she gained from her education and her loyalty to her family.REVIEWMy experience in reading EDUCATED was not without its own conflicts. This hard to forget story is both maddening and heartbreaking. It is both gripping and difficult to read. I wanted to reach out and shake Tara out of her silence of the torment and abuse she suffered. I wanted to put my arm around her and give her the confidence to yell and scream at those holding her down. I wanted to tell her to get out, and not to go back home again. She touched me with this book, and I hope it will be the salve she needs to heal. Perhaps she has finally found her voice. It’s truly amazing what Tara has been able to accomplish. My hat is off to her. I hope that someday she realizes the fault is not and was never with her. A father is suppose to protect and keep his children out of harms way, Tara’s did not. A mother is supposed to love and educate her children, Tara’s did not. A big brother is suppose to look out for his little sister. Tara’s did not. But now she’s educated and hopefully will break the cycle of abuse, denial and most of all, silence.

No, I’m not a Mormon or a Prepper, but I know plenty of people who live to some degree off the grid and have known plenty who have no trouble at all espousing doggerel that would condemn great swaths of humanity. Likewise I have known plenty who revel in ignorance and who are suspicious and paranoid to the point of mental illness. I had an uncle who, while tapping cigarette ashes onto MY PLATE (true story), opined that college “just makes you stupid”.Tara Westover was raised by a fundamentalist family led by a father who liked to lecture his family and anyone else who’d listen about the evils of government and about his particularly harsh and restrictive brand of faith. She had a brother who was a sociopathic asshat and who was physically abusive. Her homeschooling prepared her for not much more than marriage and children.Yet, she prepared for and was accepted into college and then performed so well that she was awarded grants that allowed her to go to Cambridge and Harvard and eventually led to her earning a doctorate. Her Pygmalion like transformation from mountain hillbilly to worldly sophisticate was problematic and difficult – she loves her family and the riffs her leaving and her choosing a life outside the parameters of her father’s faith caused decades of heartache and anxiety.This was well written and entertaining but at the end of the day, it was just family drama. I appreciate the struggles Tara went through and for her accomplishments, and for the obstacles she overcame, but ultimately this was about family and choosing to live on one’s own terms.I’m roughly the same age as her parents and I liked how she made objective interpretations of the family drama. Course and domineering as her father was described, Westover also describes scenes of unconditional love and almost superhuman endurance. I read that her family had hired an attorney and had challenged some of her reports of the family, particularly her opinion that her father had a serious mental health disorder.All in all a good book, sometimes difficult to read because of the violence and misogyny, and was a celebration of her triumph over adversity. Family drama can be especially difficult and Westover conveys these emotions well."

From the jacket blurb I knew there was survivalist craziness going on (in reality, ehh, not so much), but the religious basis for every single poor decision and every survival of near-death experience made me glaze over. ""The angels were watching over me"" stuff got old. I was not moved or touched, as the other reviews promised, and it's not because I'm not religious. It's because it was absurd. Honestly, I was over it almost as soon as it started.If the book were written more from the ""all this stuff I'm describing from my childhood was terrifyingly nuts and we totally know it now"" standpoint, I'd be more accepting. Instead, an almost detached Westover presents the wacko family dynamic as understandable and practically forgivable. Shruggable, even. The hindsight isn't giving me a ""we've completely stopped drinking the Kool-Aid"" vibe. I realize Tara's (obviously) mentally ill father was doing his paranoid best while presiding over the family utilizing extremist religious views, but I'm not seeing enough astonishment. I can't imagine being forced to live under that kind of tyrannical rule in poverty and isolation, where everything is done without question in God's name. But I have to believe most oppressed people understand when a situation isn't right and feel like they must find their own way --FAR FAR FAR away -- from the crazed fanaticism and irresponsible choices. This is why books like Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology and TV shows like ""Escaping Polygamy"" work. People woke the F up and fled. But here we have Tara, who seems to be telling the story from a state of shock, distant and removed, saying ""Yeah, sh*t happened."" And that's it. Where's the engagement? Where's the outrage?So my big question is this: Is Tara Westover's story as horrifying as she relates, or are we experiencing another A Million Little Pieces total exaggeration here?Who knows? All I do know is that great ratings for this book did not translate into a great experience for me. I was clearly not this book's target audience."

Pues la de Tara Westover efectivamente da para una. De Dickens, como mínimo.Hay un elemento excepcional en este libro. Excepcional porque lo que le ocurre a Westover le pasa a una de cada cien millones de personas (tirando por lo bajo) y ella misma es consciente. No es solo por poder alejarse de un entorno tóxico y lograr convertirse en un ser humano libre y hacerse con los instrumentos para que eso sea posible, sino porque a veces incluso parece que un ente sobrenatural fuera el causante de varios de los hechos que vive. Que yo porque soy atea, pero algunos de esos sucesos darían para programa de Iker Jiménez. Lo cual es hasta cómico, porque la familia de Tara Westover es mormona y muy, muy religiosa. De hecho en esa variante fanática en la que su fe deja de ser parte de un credo mayoritario y se convierte en secta. Familiar, pero secta. Lo que más me ha gustado del libro es cómo describe la autora la dificultad de alejarse del mundo que conoces, de las personas que son tu familia (la única familia que conoces). Que sí, que una vez te das cuenta de que tus progenitores están como chivos e incluso tu vida corre riesgo si les haces caso parece fácil asumir que por supuesto que vas a cortar todo lazo con ellos. Pero eso no es cierto. Es muy difícil, porque es la única gente que conoces. Son aquellos con los que te has criado, a quienes supuestamente quieres. Y si los abandonas te quedas sola en el mundo, y eso es muy duro.De verdad que lo que cuenta parece inventado de lo increíble que suena. Pero incluso si lo fuera, ocurren tantas cosas que te vuelan la cabeza que el libro se lee en un suspiro. La vida de Tara Westover es alucinante (y terrible en varios puntos) pero se hace entretenida de leer. Incluso eso es extraordinario."

Una educación no es un libro ni feliz ni fácil y, a pesar de ello, es una lectura fascinante e impactante, que enfurece y remueve. Estamos ante un cuento real pero a la vez increíble y terrorífico sobre el fanatismo, un testimonio sobre la resiliencia, una dura historia de superación y un canto al poder de la educación para cambiar la vida, para darnos la posibilidad de pensar/debatir/decidir por nosotros mismos.La religión, la moralidad, la raza, las diferencias de género, la sexualidad, la salud mental, el abuso, las relaciones familiares y humanas... Una educación habla sobre eso y mucho más, pero sobre todo habla de la libertad individual, la libertad para elegir qué es lo mejor para uno mismo y el valor para llevarlo a cabo, aunque eso signifique perder a tu familia y decir adiós a lo único que has conocido hasta el momento. Por eso mismo, también es un libro de claroscuros, tristísimo y muy crudo en su sinceridad, que huye del dogmatismo e invita a la reflexión y al perdón, algo muy necesario en los tiempos que nos han tocado vivir.#popsugar2019.

That lady, couldn't have been more correct. I mean, wow! What an amazing five star book to begin the year with. I've had a run of rather mediocre books recently, but I think those were all worth the struggle, as I feel I've finally got my reward with ""Educated""Once I got started reading this, I found it tremendously impossible to put down. This was a difficult read, and incredibly powerful, and I think everybody should read it, for that reason.

I can kind of see where some of the hype is coming from, for the simple fact that it is an interesting story. A woman, who never really had any form of schooling, manages to educate herself by going to college. It's an intriguing premise to say the least, so I figured, why not give it a go. The book is split into two parts. Part One is all about her life before college, and boy is that a doozy. Part Two is all her life after she leaves home and starts college. In all honesty, I enjoyed the first half so much more than the second. The first half was filled with drama, and a lot of very interesting topics, even if some of it was hard to read about. Once she started college though, it got downright boring. She started college, she felt like she didn't belong or fit in, she took certain classes, and so on and so forth. She writes about a handful of professors who helped her along the way, what books she was reading, her essays, thesis, PhD, or whatever she was working on at the time, and about all of her uncertainties. She does mention a bit of travel, but where she had an opportunity to write something of interest, she barely mentions anything about the cities themselves. She does go into some detail about the college campuses, or how she was in awe of a city, but that's about it. I just felt like the whole last half of the book was very woe-is-me and filled with self-doubt. It felt like the opposite of the self-empowerment book that I was expecting from the synopsis and all the rave reviews.I ultimately decided to go with a 3 star review because the first half of the book was a solid 4 stars, but the second half was a lackluster 2, so I just averaged it out. I don't regret reading it, and the second half did have a few moments that kept my interest, but I can't say it would be at the top of my list when I think of recommendations.""I call it an education."""

133,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,Rating 5 out of 5,"Insightful and genuineWhy did Tara Westover write 'Educated'? On the surface, the book appears to be a dissection of a 'Survivalist' childhood, which was flavored by a strict interpretation of Mormonism, extremist libertarian isolation and poverty. She could sign over this story to writers of a lowbrow screenplay because its bones are perfect for a sensational Lifetime movie. She has also been accused of making it up. Her parents are estranged from her. I think, because she has more to lose than gain with the publication of her autobiography at this point in her life, it is true, and Truth. [Edit September 2023: I believe Tara Westover. I think her autobiography is well-written. It resonated with me because of my own journey and escape from my parents’ parenting and teaching. Secular education saved me by giving me a sane sense of who I am based on my own five senses and logical thoughts. Secular education gave me the mental tools with which I should value myself and society. Secular education made sense of what I was seeing in the real world while what religious Christians were force-feeding me did not. Secular education also caused me to lose my family. Family members preferred the versions of life as taught through the prism of religion, and what religion and social custom said a woman’s place in society should be. I think with women’s rights being taken away again in America, I needed to state my opinions more strongly in this review, more clearly. Secular education gave me the power of control over my own body. Religion wants to put this self-realization and self-control and self-responsibility for myself into the hands of others -men who desire to enslave me, put me under their control financially and physically, and reduce me to an uneducated housewife with no money or life of my own other than that of raising children and being available for sex when a man wants me or my value for getting pregnant, rather than teach me how to be in charge of myself and to be able to make my own decisions for my life. All religions begin with ancient teachings written by ancient male tribal leaders, and all ancient religious books see women the same as cattle - property, permanently having the minds of toddlers, needing a male to control their behavior like one would train a dog despite the flowery gentle religious words texts may use to describe how to subjugate and punish a woman who is a wife or slave, adult female or child bride. Today, these ancient books have been translated, often with errors, into many other languages. People, to remain religious, have been forced to pick and choose the rules and rites they want to believe in because so many of these ancient texts do not match reality as science has proved reality to be. Religious people end up going through mental gymnastics and philosophical twisting of science discoveries and facts about women’s bodies and minds in order to remain religious believers who must believe in their religious texts. Those who try to square the circle of the treatment of women described in their religious texts often use insane logic - usually ending up trying to convince non-believers with something quite insanely illogical like God didn’t mean it the way he said it as written in their sacred text, or that we shouldn’t take the texts as God’s commandments after all, but use that which is good and useful. This picking and choosing, and interpretating the text into what you want it to say, revising ancient commands of God into a scientific and philosophical rationality that suits the present, negates the text’s authority, imho. Either people believe the text is word of God not to be tampered with, or they believe it can be tampered with which actually is expressing disbelief in what is supposed to be the actual words of God. Come on, believers, can’t you hear yourselves?]What is Survivalism? See the Wikipedia article:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survi...Losing one's Religion (whatever it is - whether in a parent, or in a political leader, or in a spouse or, yes, an actual religion) is harder than enduring torture because its effects last a lot longer and it is more destructive. Feeling a Dissonance is often the beginning of losing one's Religion. For normal people, when experiencing a whiff of mental dissonance because of a parent’s deviant interpretation of something, or especially something inside a religious paradigm, fear can eat away at your soul like a worm hiding inside an apple. Just saying. From experience, gentle reader.Dissonance is a particularly corrosive feeling when it involves love, home and Family. People tend to dig in even deeper, and hang on to childhood beliefs as if they mean dear life (maybe it does) whatever the cost of ignoring Reality. Losing Faith strikes at one's very sense of self, as well as one's understanding of Reality and loved ones. However, sometimes the corrosion of dissonance leads inexorably to completely losing one’s faith-based belief (not necessarily religious) after gaining Knowledge (getting educated). This results in being emotionally expelled from Hearth and Home much as Adam and Eve were evicted from the Garden of Eden. It is just how it is. It happened to me. It apparently happened to Cambridge historian Tara Westover (in a different way). Her powerful memoir is literary so she shows it, not says it. Maybe you will see a different interpretation of her book. However, I think she left a very obvious trail of personal epiphanies in this dramatic coming-of-age story. Her epiphanies happen to be almost mirror images of mine, but of course, her epiphanies are filtered through a different lens of family, timeline and neighborhood. She clearly is much smarter, and I envy her that. Given her life story, she probably would be uncomfortable with my views on several levels, but there we are. I have a self which belongs only to me because of getting educated, as she finally does also, since having at last embraced her true self, too."
134,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,Rating 4 out of 5,"It is of endless relief to me that this woman managed an escape from her family, though of course I know how the pain of leaving has scarred her. We all have scars at the end, I want to tell her. It is the ones gotten from life-threatening, abusive behaviors we do not have to accept as normal. As a memoir, this is simply a brilliant one. Whether or not it is true in all its details is beside the point. Tara herself says there are many different remembrances of conversations and events. She kept a journal that faithfully recorded how she heard things that happened during stressful times in her life. Her version has an internal consistency that is hard to ignore, and since she is the one “coming clean,” as it were, we are inclined to believe her version of events above others. It is also possible to see how a religious mindset could blind one to what actually happened.Tara Westover lived in a family of anti-government survivalists in northern Idaho. What happened to the children in her family was truly terrible, and exemplifies the definition of delusional in today’s secular society. At a time when our nation has grown to encompass many different religions, races, and ethnicities, Westover’s family, from their perch on a piece of land in northern Idaho, believed in self-reliance and in a single truth, even it meant sacrifice of the clan. Delusional people sometimes forget that creating a life presents a challenge to one’s set of beliefs, in that each individual comes with free will and a right to life. Tara recounts instances when her father’s investments in his scrapyard turned out badly, and incomes were strained to the point of breaking but for the ingenuity and generosity of family members determined to help out. But I will have to admit Tara’s descriptions of what her brother and father subjected her to while they were working in the scrapyard nearly blew out my blood pressure. With each sentence she stoked my indignation. At an early age I knew stupidity and exploitation when I saw it, but this could have been because of my own physical and mental weaknesses. Tara lasted longer in that environment because she was so able and strong.We get very little background on the family before Tara is born. That seems fair: Tara must understand her parents’ story is theirs to tell. Suffice it to say the father may have been an undiagnosed paranoid schizophrenic and bipolar. It appears he didn’t believe in public governance, or people coming together with good intent to solve societal wrongs. He believed in his own modified Mormon version of god and gospel and self-reliance. By itself this could almost be ignored except when he subjected his children to his mad imaginings, many of which were dangerous to their health and wellbeing. Tara never went to school as a youngster, and she was not home-schooled. Like two of her brothers before her, she read enough to pass the state ACT, after which she attended Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. Her professors there were very impressed with her ability to think, and did what they could to advance her education by recommending her to attend Cambridge University in England. It must also be said that a bishop in the church there seemed to understand the obstacles Tara’s family presented by being so resistant to the larger world, and tried to help. Tara’s professors at Cambridge were likewise impressed with her ability to reason and recommended her for a scholarship to Harvard. There she pursued a degree looking at the constraints and obligations family ties present when considered in the context of the larger society in which we live, but she could only look at nineteenth century philosophers. The advancements in thinking in twentieth and twenty-first centuries was too diverse and modern for someone of her religious upbringing to consider. Nowhere do we get a sense of her understanding of race in our country and around the world. Her father may have been isolated out there in Idaho, but in his isolation he developed attitudes dangerously close to fascism. How has Tara developed her attitudes towards people of color after her upbringing would be interesting, if not particularly instructive. But we never learn that.She is an interesting case study. Perhaps her professors thought so, too. Without a doubt she has a fascinating story and is able to tell it well. I listened to the Random House audio of this book, very beautifully read by Julia Whelan. It was involving, but infuriating that any child would have to withstand that kind of thoughtlessness and carelessness on their own behalf. It undoubtedly gave her some kind of strengths, but angst and self-doubt also. I wish her good luck. It is quite a story."

Hasta observar la coincidencia entre el nombre de la protagonista y el de la autora, pensaba que leía un libro de ficción. Incluso así, algunas cosas resultaban difíciles de asimilar...La autora relata los primeros años de su vida en una familia mormona fundamentalista, presa de una autoridad paterna inapelable y una suspicacia extrema hacia las Instituciones en general y hacia todo lo que estuviera fuera de los radicales principios impuestos al clan. Varios de los jóvenes de la familia (la autora incluída) no reciberon educación tradicional, ni atención médica tradicional, ni vacunas. En realidad, si creemos todo lo que la autora relata (y no tenemos motivos para no hacerlo...) debemos pensar en padres decididamente ineptos para la crianza. Con una peligrosa combinación de impericia y fe ciega, el padre de familia pone en riesgo a su prole una y otra vez, casi con entusiasmo. La figura materna es presentada como insegura y temerosa, siempre inquieta por no despertar la ira del marido y absorbiendo los impactos ( a veces, literalmente) de su extravagante conducta. En fin, que esta forma de pensar, extrema y opresiva, es la ""educación"" transmitida a los hijos, sumada a un continuo menoscabo hacia su capacidad de reflexión crítica y su afán de superación. La autora, que jamás había recibido educación formal pero debe contar con una capacidad de asimilación notable, logra acceder a la educación Universitaria. Tara Westover hace el relato de estas experiencias personales de forma eficiente y sin grandes pretensiones. Eso se agradece. Porque el plato fuerte de esta lectura, es el retrato de una realidad claustrofóbica, los peligros del fundamentalismo extremo y de la interpretación dudosa y personal de ciertos principios religiosos. Y el auxilio de la ""educación"", claro, ahora como instrumento de liberación y cambio. Es con lo me quedo de esta lectura."

This book is nothing like that. It is deeply personal, painful and powerful and tells a story that needed to be told and that people should hear. It is also as enthralling as any good novel.

It’s supposed to be full of frustratingly irrational people and constant epiphanies about life. But...do I really need almost 400 pages of that? It’s exhausting.I listened to the audiobook (which is the only way I can read nonfiction) and the reader was excellent. Seriously. But, I can only listen with rapt attention for so long when it’s just car accident after car accident, junkyard accident after junkyard accident. Everyone has a concussion—got it. No one goes to the hospital. Yep. Dad has an undiagnosed, unmedicated mental illness and everyone lets him run rampant. Mhmm. No school, fear the Illuminati, run away from the government. Still here with you. Half the family has nearly burned to death literally). Somehow they’re all still standing. I sat through the last six chapters just waiting for it to end so I could be put out of my misery.Maybe...that’s the point? Westover does an excellent job conveying the painful insanity that is/was her life. I just....needed her to do it in about 100 less (fewer?) pages.The manipulation and brainwashing that went on was A+. Like, seriously. Round of applause to her family, especially her parents. It was infuriating to see how even after all of the abuse she suffered, Westover still went back to them on her hands and knees over and over.The writing style wasn’t my favorite. I don’t need to be constantly told how pretty the mountain/grass/land is. I got it. I can make up a mountain in my head. I can’t make up what your six siblings look like or even the layout of the house/junkyard, so...if you could share those kinds of details instead...that would be great. I did appreciate her footnotes explaining that while she remembered certain events this way, her brothers remembered them differently. Westover did a great job reminding readers that memories are untrustworthy, particularly when they involve trauma.But, again...this all could have been accomplished in about half the amount of pages had she cut the lightbulb moments. They grew really repetitive and blah after awhile. I’m having a hard time explaining what I mean. It’s almost as if she’s trying to sound...deep...or something every few paragraphs. It felt forced, mostly because it was the same “deep” revelation over and over.Zero clue if that made sense.tl;dr—It was fine. I don’t need to read it again.P.S.—I have two sort of spoilery warnings about this book.The first is for animal lovers (the ones who like animals more than people, like I do): There’s a violent dog death 88% in. I’d give you the exact page # if I hadn’t read this on iBooks. You’ll know it’s coming when she mentions a bloody knife. There are also vague references throughout to selling horses to slaughterhouses. They’re not descriptive and she doesn’t spend time on them, but I thought you should know.The second is for people like my who know that more often than not, reading a memoir means you’re going to be reading about abuse. This book does NOT have sexual abuse in it. It DOES have physical abuse. For me, physical abuse I can somewhat handle. Sexual abuse I cannot."

The worst part is that he is a real-life human being and not a work of fiction. He is the worst kind of product of their awful upbringing; abusive and racist.Extreme religion is like joining a cult, they use it as an excuse to behave abominably. The Mormonism displayed within the pages of this book is used to control and is terribly misogynistic.Tara’s father, Gene, acts as some kind of prophet. He believes that the world will end when the clock strikes midnight on the year 2000 (Y2K). When it didn’t happen, he felt disappointed that “God had denied him this”. 😬 I had wondered if he suffered from bipolar disorder long before the book touched on the subject! When Tara hears about bipolar for the first time during a class, about its symptoms, she relates it instantly to the way her Dad acts - with his paranoia and delusions. Religious delusions are actually a common symptom of bipolar mania. The style of parenting, the (low) level of “home-schooling”, meant that Tara and her brothers barely received any semblance of an education. They aren’t even allowed to take medicine, her mother Faye insists on always using herbal remedies that scarcely work to help. Apart from, by some miracle, it seemed to help Gene after his face basically got melted half off in an explosion. He somehow survived it without going to a hospital. It’s actually hard to believe just how many accidents members of the Westover family appear to get into!Despite all this constant family drama and weirdness, one of her brothers gets into college. So, Tara is determined to forge a different life path for herself other than the one her parents are trying to force her to follow. She fixates on education; learning as much as she can about the world because she had lived such a sheltered existence. This new path will take her to Cambridge University and beyond… This moving memoir tracks all the ways that conservative/religious/traditional American life can put up roadblocks and actively dissuade a person from outgrowing their “roots”. This is about the real-life horror of being born into an abusive family dynamic and feeling trapped there.”To admit uncertainty is to admit to weakness, to powerlessness, and to believe in yourself despite both. It is a frailty, but in this frailty there is a strength: the conviction to live in your own mind, and not in someone else’s.”Educated was one of my big reads I picked out for Women’s History Month, but had to take my time with it given how heavy it gets. Even though I had to take breaks to catch my breath at times, the importance and powerfulness of a book like this means I have to rate it 5 Stars."
139,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/113245296-jesse,Rating 3 out of 5,"I'm going to take the minority position on Ms. Westover's memoir and say I didn't highly enjoy it. I read it on the recommendation of a friend, he said it was one of his favorite books ever (he doesn't have a great track record for book recommendations). I think it needs to be ""taken with a grain of salt"" as the saying goes. It's like listening to someone who is going through a divorce, of course, their ex is crazy, of course, it was a toxic relationship, it's one-sided, and that's exactly what we are getting here with Ms. Westover's Educated. If I wrote a book about my childhood it would be drastically different from the version my brother would write, and my parents would have a version all their own too. I'm not saying I don't believe the story as its been presented here, I'm just thinking there has to be more to the story. For a family to produce three PhDs out of six children, there had to be some form of education happening in the home. That doesn't just happen by random chance. I don't want to sound like I'm belittling Tara's experience and feelings I just think it's a little one-sided. Who's to be the judge of when passing on beliefs and ideologies to one's children goes too far? Obviously, Val Westover had some pretty serious problems with mental illness, and the ""dotting mother"" Laree was borderline delusional and completely oblivious to her surroundings. But when one has deep-rooted beliefs however contrary to modern society when does it become wrong to indoctrinate one's children with those same beliefs and behaviors? It's all about perspective, with Educated, we are getting young Tara's perspective of the going ons at Buck Peak. So take it however you want."
140,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/929238-hbalikov,Rating 4 out of 5,"""The distance—physical and mental—that had been traversed in the last decade nearly stopped my breath, and I wondered if perhaps I had changed too much. All my studying, reading, thinking, traveling, had it transformed me into someone who no longer belonged anywhere? I thought of the girl who, knowing nothing beyond her junkyard and her mountain, had stared at a screen, watching as two planes sailed into strange white pillars. Her classroom was a heap of junk. Her textbooks, slates of scrap. And yet she had something precious that I—despite all my opportunities, or maybe because of them—did not.""""I laughed maniacally for ten minutes at this irony: that having sacrificed my family to my education, I might lose that, also.""""If I had explained to my supervisor, Dr. Runciman, why I was unable to work, he would have helped me, would have secured additional funding, petitioned the department for more time. But I didn’t explain, I couldn’t. He had no idea why it had been nearly a year since I’d sent him work, so when we met in his office one overcast July afternoon, he suggested that I quit.""This is the tension that runs through this memoir: How will Tara Westover, a “home-schooled” child from the bleak mountains of Idaho get free from the abusive (both mentally and physically) family that sees most outsiders and schools and hospitals and government as contrary to “God’s will” and a plot by Communists and the Illuminati (in league with the Devil) to divert this family from its unique Mormon path of righteousness?Tara’s father is the initial driving force. A man who has rejected education - sees plots everywhere - is a lay preacher - and finds/sells scrap metal to pay the bills. He demands obedience, which Tara provides early and often but not completely. When she doesn’t, she suffers and (by various family) she is told: “He is a great man. For the rest of your life you will regret not humbling yourself and following his counsel.” He is almost always indifferent to others’ injuries or risks. ""Dad looked up, surprised. He’d forgotten I was there. When he saw the blood, he walked over to me and put a hand on my shoulder. “Don’t worry, honey,” he said. “God and his angels are here, working right alongside us. They won’t let you be hurt.”""Because Dad always put faith before safety. Because he believed himself right, and he kept on believing himself right—after the first car crash, after the second, after the bin, the fire, the pallet. And it was us who paid."" It seems that every child has the scars (internal and external) from his failure to prioritize their welfare. This extends to not tolerating any questions of his judgment or authority. Tara’s mother is a more interesting character because she has an arc of success that takes her from housewife through midwife to entrepreneurial popularity with selling “natural extracts.” As this happens, Tara, recalls a few incidents where her mother is able/willing to assert herself in discussions. Some of this allows Tara to explore music and dance and eventually go to college.My thanks to my GR friends who encouraged me to read this book: Trish; Will Byrnes; David Schaafsma; BlackOxford; Darwin8u; da Al; and more.There is always some difference between the objective and the subjective. Many questions arose for me as I read this autobiography. •	Westover says that this is not about Mormonism or any form of religious belief, but it is clear that religious belief and the duty to “humble” and “follow counsel” is part and parcel of this story. What comes through was caught by my GR friend Michael in his observation that, “The Church is the only connection to the rest of humanity that is tolerated among them (those who surround Tara in her Idaho family).” One of Westover’s triumphs is to let us see the world through that lens. However, it isn’t clear what if any of that she retains, including her musings about her “mountain.”•	It is, in some ways, harder to understand her rationalizations about the abuse by her brother, Shawn, than it is the abuse by her father. Others can see aspects of it but choose to forget, minimize or rationalize rather than aid Tara.•	Why do we know so little about any efforts to get Westover into therapy and why it eventually came about?•	Westover writes that she had “a fractured mind.” Why doesn’t she discuss more about the insights she gained from therapy? Did she share any of her journals with her therapist?•	She, in one section, seizes on the “Pygmalion” metaphor but she breaks away from it without any explanation. Why was it attractive and did she resent being seen in this context?•	Westover states: ""I had built a new life, and it was a happy one, but I felt a sense of loss that went beyond family.” Does this speak to issues that cannot be resolved?•	She provides only the barest references to her deep relationship with an “outsider,” Why? For Westover’s own health, this memoir needed to be shared. I am frustrated by having to set some of these questions aside without a definitive answer. Reading it was a deeply emotional experience coupled with the knowledge that others right now may be subjected to similar deprivation and abuse…and I won’t know anything about that."
141,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/676000-susan-meissner,Rating 5 out of 5,"I remember seeing this book when it first came out and loving that pencil drawing (could nearly smell that wood shaving/graphite combo that only an old-fashioned pencil can produce) and wondering what it was about. I didn't realize it was a memoir of one woman's growing up in a very unique, dare I say it, dysfunctional quasi-Mormon family in the mountains of Idaho. It's a book about that kind of upbringing (ultra conservative, Ruby-Ridgish, oppressively survivalist) but more than that, it's a book about this woman's struggle to become her own person, which many of us do within the safe guard rails of home, but not her.The reading was compelling, partly because it's a true story and partly because Tara Westover is a gifted wordsmith. Though she never stepped inside a formal classroom until she was seventeen, she nevertheless overcame every seemingly impossible hurdle to her education. She earned a Ph.D within a decade of that first moment in real school, all while navigating her journey to discovering her place in this world, sometimes with the help of her parents and siblings, but more often despite them.I was reminded of Jeanette Walls' The Glass Castle, which I loved, and though the stories are different, the two books evoke the same feelings, at least for me. I love what is written about the book in the inside front cover: ""EDUCATED is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty, and of the grief that comes of severing one's closest ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes, and the will to change it.""All of us are in a classroom of some kind when we're growing up. We are all learning to be the person we will be the rest of our adult life. It may not be a traditional room with rows of desks but learning is taking place within the environment provided to us, from the moment we take our first breath. We are born, we begin to grow, we begin to learn. I am sure there are plenty of untold sad stories out there where children raised in oppressive learning environments could not break out of them, but this is a powerful story of a young woman who did."

So last week while I was traveling, I met someone who had just read this book and when he found out I was from Idaho, and Mormon, he could not stop talking about this book, and asking if I had heard of this family, etc. So of course I had to have a copy! (Special thanks to Anderson's Bookshop in Chicago!) And wow, wow, WOW. Fascinating. Heartbreaking. And yes, I believe it all. Tara grew up about 100 miles south of where I did, and went to BYU. I knew families like hers, though not as extreme. I know people like this now. I went to school with kids who were only at public school for an hour a day, to take orchestra or choir, and the rest of the time they were taught at home from a ""Christian curriculum."" I know people who aren't immunized, who are anti-antibiotics and modern medicine. And, sadly, I know people who have suffered abuse, or grew up in a home with a mentally ill (and unmedicated) parent. Tara Westover suffered under all these things: her family, though supposedly Mormon, is ruled over by a father whose mental illness has convinced him that he is a sort of prophet and that the End Is Nigh. Every minute of her childhood was spent learning about the evils of the world, the evils of government, and how hard they needed to prepare to survive. Caches of home canned food, weapons, even gasoline and gold bars, were hidden around the family's land. I won't go into much more, but this story is amazing.Tara is a genius (and I suspect actually that everyone in her family is), and her writing is flawless. Reading about her life isn't easy, I was angry and sad for her in turns. But I loved her, and I admire her, and I could not put this book down. "

This one, however, had aroused my curiosity. I usually get a schadenfreude-like thrill from reading about those who have had worse childhoods than my own. And, while I was still making up my mind to read-it-or-not, this title was forced on me by someone wanting to sell me things.  I'm the audiobook buyer for our library, and I recently received a visitor from Playaway. (My FIRST sales rep - I felt like such a grownup!) Instead of books on CD, their company peddles books loaded onto small plastic rectangles. One AAA battery, and some earbuds are all that's required to enjoy an audiobook anywhere. Though the suckers are pretty pricey, I was interested. I'm tired of our audio stock being returned with scratched or missing discs. With this device, the only thing the patrons can lose, besides the entire unit, is the little plastic battery case cover. So, I gave the rep a definite ""maybe"" and she gave me a little plastic rectangle featuring Educated. I have to admit, my first experience with Playaway was top-notch: having a book pumped into your head through earbuds makes for a more intimate feel than listening to a CD in a car or across the room. (I don't mean to sound like a company shill here - I just enjoyed my trial of a new-to-me product.) I definitely recommend giving it a whirl . . . only with a different book. I suppose Westover's story is meant to be inspiring - a sober, yet uplifting tale of a plucky young woman's rise from near-poverty and religious fervor to the hallowed halls of academia, BUT all I will remember of this book is the extremely detailed descriptions of children being injured in the horrific accidents they suffered when their nightmare of a father forced them to work in the family's salvage yard, AND the sadistic mental and physical abuse endured by women at the hands of men who believed that worshiping God made them powerful as gods themselves. As a firm believer that the family you create is far more important than the one you're born into, I had trouble grasping the author's reluctance to leave these people behind. Then again, I'm an only child who's been an orphan since 2008, so maybe I just don't get family ties.  Since it was so hard for me to separate my disdain for the people in this book with the book itself, I'm giving it three stars instead of two. Westover's writing is fine, and it's not her fault that I don't understand her motives. I found this one to be a deeply unpleasant read, but it may, I suppose, be good fodder for bookclub discussions."

This is a memoir written by Tara Westover and follows her life as someone who grew up in a devout Mormon survivalist family without any formal education, Tara did not step foot in a class room until she was 17 and up to that point had very limited knowledge on the world and its history. Her and her six siblings grew up working on her fathers junkyard in a wildly unsafe environment.Her upbringing was brutal at times and made for difficult reading - the family did not believe in using hospitals or doctors and some of the injuries depicted are truly horrific, how they managed to survive through most of them is beyond me.Tara also suffered at the hands of an abusive older brother and in my opinion, an abusive father. It would have been very easy to present these people and abusive situations with an obvious one dimensional villain however Westover manages to humanise them in a remarkable way. Reading from her perspective and experiencing her conflicting opinions was at once incredibly moving and unsettling.  Tara's love of education and her drive to do well shine in this memoir and when she finally became Dr Tara Westover i was truly elated. I don't think I've ever been prouder of someone I've never met!I was engrossed by this story and found the writing to be excellent and captivating - I highly recommend this! A beautifully poignant book and one that I imagine will stick with me for a long time."

And I hope I am able to form words that will convince you!Tara Westover is seventeen the first time she goes to school. That was basically the premise in one sentence. It at least what I understood. I was constantly reminding myself that this was someone's story. I mean there were some parts that had me on the edge of my seat, crying, groaning in frustration. It was awesome.So Tara's Dad... I honesty felt bad because I really was angry toward him. I felt bad because unlike other books, he's not a fictional character, he's a real person. For a while, I was stuck thinking that I was evil to be angry towards a real person. The only thing that made me feel better was when Tara (who is narrating the book) shares that she was angry to. I felt better after that and my anger died down because later we find out that the dad might have had bipolar disorder but it was never diagnosed because he refused to go to a doctor.Which is a perfect segue, to my next point. When I read the premise U thought.  Ok, so she's never gone to school. Maybe because she didn't want to? Or her parents needed her to work? I was wrong. The dad (His name is Gene so I will refer to him as so for the rest of this review), as we find out later, has bipolar disorder. This causes him to be paranoid. And a little cra-cra. Anyway, I was really surprised by his way of life. He refused to go to the doctor (and refused to let his family go), even when he was burned alive and his wife got a major concussion (Those were some of the events that anger me. You see it was his fault that Tara's mother didn't get the help she needed, causing her to stop being a midwife. He was disappointed which made me so mad. Because it was his fault that she stopped mid-wifing. Sorry, I was just super frustrated)Anyway, Gene is super paranoid and sometimes puts himself and his family in danger.Speaking of danger, let's talk about Shawn. He was abusing his family, his girlfriend(s). And no one would stand up to him or tell someone about his issues. Oy, it was frustrating. Actually, I just remembered that in the end, Tara and Audrey and Mother do talk to people and each other about his abusive-ness. Even though, in the end, that issue was never really resolved.But then Tara goes away to school. I was so happy and proud of her. And I was glad when she finally realized her dad had been wrong. And then when she goes to get her vaccinations, I though: WAY TO GO, TARA!And the kindness her professors showed her really warmed my heart. I was a little disappointed by the ending. Now, I know this was a memoir so it really couldn't have a perfect ending. But still... Bottom Line:5/5 Stars: A little boring in the beginning, but amazing towards the end.

148,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13958700-nicole-lisa,Rating 1 out of 5,"How do you rate a book that is someone's memories of surviving terrible abuse and neglect? You can't really. What I can do is judge what is missing. Spoilers follow.This is not a memoir; this is therapy. I never understood that difference before. The author's journey is not finished enough to produce a memoir. She should have waited another year, 10 years, 30 years so that she could write a memoir, not just publish her therapy. That does not mean the story is not gripping and terrible but it is not redemptive, because the author has not shared her redemption. She has cut out the final stages, glossing and eliding the big questions that memoir answers. I think she has not answered them for herself, or she does not like the answers, in which case maybe she should not have published this book.Where is the self-reflection in the first third of the book on the abuse and neglect she suffered as a child? This abuse and neglect is recounted with almost no reflection, no insight, no learning from an adult perspective.Where is her realization that she was the abuser in her relationship with Charles? Reading between the lines she wrote, she was, as much as her family ever was abusive to her. Did she ever apologize and try to make amends? Where is her acknowledgement that her sister had none of the advantages the author had? That her sister, uneducated, dependent economically and emotionally on her other family members, alone in many ways, took the enormous, brave step of admitting to the author the abuse they had both suffered? Where is the help the author could have extended to her sister? Where is the author's realization that she played a role in her sister denying her and the abuse they suffered later? Where is the reflection that she played a role in her sister remaining in an abusive situation? I'm not judging the actions the author took to ensure her own survival--I have no doubt that she was fighting for her own survival, physical, emotional and mental--but her lack of reflection on those actions.Where is her realization that she could have helped Tyler in his confrontation with their parents, that they were two adults confronting the abuse in their family, rather than children, older brother and younger sister?How did she get from the person she was in chapter 35 to a person who could stand against her father in chapter 36?Why am I so upset about these questions? I think because when you publish a memoir, you set yourself up as a kind of expert: look I have survived abuse and this is how; I have remade myself and this is how. But the author has not achieved the insight of an expert or she did not share her insight, and she expected us not to notice. It's possible that she never noticed; likely in my opinion. I expect a book, whether non-fiction or fiction, to close its arc. This arc has not been closed. It is still a work in progress. That is fine, acceptable, expected, in a person; not so much in a book, especially memoir."

She was also emotionally abused for many, many years by her father, as well as emotionally and physically abused by her brother Sean. That she escaped that life at all is remarkable. That she did so through a course of self-education that ultimately led to advanced degrees from Harvard and Cambridge is truly extraordinary.However, as I read this memoir, I kept thinking about the John Connor quotation from the movie Terminator 2:We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua and places like that. For a while there, she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns. Then there were some other guys. She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from so she could teach me how to be this great military leader. Then she gets busted and it's like, ""Sorry kid, your mom's a psycho. Didn't you know?"" It's like, everything I'd been brought up to believe was all made of bullshit? I hated her for that.What’s missing from this book is Ms. Westover’s anger. She was essentially brainwashed about the world for the first 17 years of her life. Once she finally learned how much had been taken from her, she ... describes it in a detached fashion and presents it seemingly without judgement, as if antisemitism and herbal remedies for car accident injuries are an equally valid way to move through the world. Worse, Ms. Westover writes of being abused by her father, betrayed by her mother, repeatedly abused and threatened by one of her brothers. Yet, for many years too long, she keeps going back home for more.Ms. Westover is a talented writer. Her portrayal of being a victim of abuse is the most effective part of the memoir, but many parts are moving. However, as with  Hillbilly Elegy, I found myself far less inspired by this book than others seem to have been. Every child learns that their parents are flawed, and how to create their own worldview apart from their parents’. Ms Westover had to overcome much more than normal, and has excelled in a way few do. Perhaps it’s a testament to the power of child rearing that despite everything in this memoir, Ms. Westover yearns for a reconciliation with the parents who damn near crushed her hundreds of times."

Good on you girl!!So, I’m making this review short. You've either read Educated, heard about the book or seen it everywhere on Goodreads updates.Get to it! I did audio on this and finished it in days. Those dog walks kept getting longer and longer while listening to this crazy ass family.Her parents are fanatical Mormons and survivalists that are preparing for the end of time and also for the government to kill them.Have you ever heard of a sovereign citizen? Yep, that's Tara's parents.They also did not believe in hospitals, public school systems or any type of help from the government. And good grief, her Dad needed the most help with mental care!This book was just fascinating, gripping and horrifying at times. The amount of crazy that the parents and a brother (Shawn) tried to instill into reality and facts was jaw dropping.Check out what gaslighting means. This was a common theme in Educated.Gaslighting - a form of emotional abuse or psychological manipulation involving distorting the truth in order to confuse or instill doubt in another person to the point they question their sanity or reality.Tara’s parents did this along with her brother Shawn. And if you could not see this in the book, we obviously read different books.Kudos to Tara Westover for getting out of a no-win situation with her parents and brother Shawn. In her parents’ radical thoughts and beliefs, women were more inferior to men, much less believable if they came forward with abuse charges.Damn, there were parts of this book that made me so mad. I felt for Tara on having to grow up in this type of destructive, violent and neglectful way as a child and teenager.The best way that I could describe her parents and family situation is Idaho Taliban!!Recommended to anyone that loves memoirs, books on cults or radical religion, and self powering stories!"

And then there is me. This audio was enjoyable...entertaining...no. Not only do I not want to have those feelings about a story riddled with unchecked mental illness and abuse (and trust me when I say there is sadly SO much going on here that was unhealthy), but I also don’t have those feelings toward this story or really, many feelings at all. Therein lies the problem for me. This one didn’t affect me too much because it seemed very factual and not very emotional. This could be my perception or it could be a coping mechanism that the author uses to tell her story, but regardless of the reason, a memoir without an emotional connection doesn’t really work for me. The author’s accomplishments, educational and otherwise, are nothing short of phenomenal coming from any background, so coming from her particular set of circumstances makes her intelligence, resilience, ambition, and perseverance a truly spectacular feat. She has my admiration for surviving and overcoming her circumstances and my condolences for having had to survive them, but in terms of the book, I found it repetitive and a little too detached. Something was missing for me but I am definitely the outlier. 3.5 stars"

It's easy to say education is the most powerful weapon we have to change the world, but the inverse is also true - education can shape the world in many ways abd many pockets of the world are shaped and misshaped thus.I'm not sure if in the end I attribute this story to misinformation or mental illness, but either way it's a searching exploration of what education can and cannot do."
154,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56111743-roman-clodia,Rating 3 out of 5,"Gosh, this book! I'd seen some scepticism about Westover's story including from friends whose opinions I trust but still tried to go into this open-minded. On balance, I'd say that this is good on the emergence of a 'Tara Westover' who has a voice, mind and character of her own despite the closed and abusive nature of her family upbringing. Interesting, too, on the ties that bind us to family, on the way visceral emotions may war with rational knowledge - how a person may *know* her family relationships are deeply unhealthy, even dangerous, and yet still yearn to be accepted within that group. But there is so much here that is, literally, incredible...Firstly, I've seen people talk about Westover's background as if she grew up in poverty and off-the-grid and she certainly seems to encourage that view: in reality, though, reading carefully, her family have money for expensive equipment used in her father's businesses and we hear of him winning contracts to 'build industrial granaries in Malad City' and 'dad had been hired by Utah Power to dismantle hundreds of utility towers'. He collects guns, he has cars and trailers, he has 'a thousand gallons of fuel buried in the field.' He even files tax returns as does Westover's mother, as we learn when Westover is applying for scholarships - hardly either poor or off-the-grid, surely?I also found Westover's account of her almost complete ignorance of the modern world hard to accept: she was born in 1986, the family has cable TV, they go to the movies, they have a computer with internet access, she's been working since she was 11 in town, later works in a grocery store where, presumably, there are newspapers and magazines, she buys 'Les Miserables' so has access to bookstores, she even has a mobile phone... and yet she claims that she had 'only ever seen one black person' before going away to university. She knows nothing about Civil Rights; she thinks Europe is a country blah blah blah. She also makes much of how she'd never heard of the Holocaust until she was an undergraduate. This is especially odd given that when her parents come to visit, her father gives a crazy lecture in the restaurant about the Jewish 'conspiracy' that links WW2 to the United Nations and the EU (!) and, ultimately, the imminent destruction of the world. I mean, he's crazy, but he's not cut off in some kind of ahistorical, religious limbo. How come she is, then? While Westover is constrained by her parent's religion, she wears make-up at 15, she has music and singing lessons as a child, she takes part in theatrical productions in town including 'Annie' and 'Carousel', and no-one seems to blink when she starts having boyfriends both before she goes away, and when she brings one home from university. Odd, huh? The bit that stuck most with me, though, are the amazing number of accidents that the Westover family suffer: they are brain damaged in car accidents, they're burnt down to the bone, they have huge gashes in their limbs, one brother has a hole in his head through which, we're told, Westover can see his brain matter, we even have an instance of someone burnt so badly that they can't even drink water through their scalded tissues - but never fear, despite refusing all medical care and painkillers, despite stopping breathing, even, they all survive with no more than Mother Westover's home-made herbal treatments! (Interesting, too, that she's so successful at this homeopathic business that she becomes the biggest employer in the county). Little things niggled throughout: Westover lies that she's graduated high-school when she applies to university - does no-one in the US check these claims? It's 2002, after all. Despite claiming to have had no more than a haphazard home-schooling and knowing nothing of science, she aces her university entrance exam. Once there, despite never having written an academic essay in her life, she's getting As in all her modules. Natural intelligence is one thing, knowing how to harness that intelligence to academic forms of expression and structures is quite another. Interestingly, 3 out of the 7 Westover siblings went on the get PhDs - a high rate for any family, let alone one as dysfunctional, education-free and intellectually-starved as this book claims. This *is* a gripping read and the aura of violence and abuse feels authentic. Westover has, of course, done well to survive her family, to assert herself as she has and to take control of her own life. With an inspirational story already there, I just wonder about the need for such sensationalism and constant over-egging that caused me to sometimes just giggle at the extremism (those injuries! are the Westovers the most accident-prone and unlucky family in the history of the world?) that seems (mis)calculated to engender sympathy, horror and admiration - most of us would have had that anyway."
155,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2947323-dianne,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a real jaw-dropper of a memoir. Tara Westover is raised in an isolated fundamentalist Mormon family in Idaho. Her father is a bipolar and paranoid survivalist, with a deep distrust of government. The Westover children run wild, helping their father with his junkyard scrapping business and their mother with her mid-wifing and herbal and essential oil concoctions. The children do not go to school and are not (for the most part) home schooled beyond the very basics of reading and arithmetic. They see no doctors, trusting their mother entirely for their medical care with her home remedies. The father rules the roost, the mother submitting to his authority over the household. While there is no doubt the parents loved their children, the father's mental illness and the mother's acquiescence to him failed them all.Westover's memoir recounts her astonishing journey from ignorant backwoods wildchild to Cambridge scholar. Her childhood memories are fraught with family incidents that defy belief - multiple car accidents with traumatic head injuries; junkyard scrapping injuries including falls, extremities being crushed and gashed, severe burns; and physical and verbal abuse at the hands of a psychotic and manipulative sibling. The amount of physical injury in this book is staggering. If even ONE of these things happened in your family, it would be traumatic enough. Add all of these together in one family AND have almost no proper medical care, it's just incomprehensible. I have a hard time believing these incidents were as serious as Westover describes with no one dying. For example, a third degree burn victim being healed at home with comfrey, lobelia and plantain salves and enemas for hydration due to mouth and lung burns? With no medication for pain or a sterile environment or skin grafts? It's nothing short of a miracle.It's a very interesting and gripping story. In spite of all the familial trauma Westover underwent, her perseverance and drive led her to Brigham Young University, where she had to bring herself up to speed on the world events and societal conventions that all of us learned in elementary and secondary schools. She had never heard of The Holocaust or the civil rights movement until those events were discussed in one of her college classes. After Brigham Young, she continued her education at Cambridge University and Harvard, earning a PhD in history at Cambridge. Interestingly, two of her brothers who separated themselves physically from the family also earned PhDs. The other siblings remained close to home. The parents started a successful business, Butterfly Express Quality Essential Oils, based on the mother's homeopathic remedies and they appear to be doing quite well.After I was finished with the memoir, I was curious about how her revelations went down with the rest of her family. Even though she used pseudonyms for most of her family's first names, it takes about 30 seconds on Google and Facebook to sort things out and find the family members and the Butterfly Express website. According to her family's attorney, the parents feel maligned by Westover's account and basically claim that what Westover deems an extremist mindset, the parents view as ""self-sufficiency."" Uh huh....I guess, technically, neglect and abuse CAN lead to self-sufficency of a sort. Leave it to an attorney to come up with that one.Hard to put down (except the burn parts, I had to keep putting the book down for those brief sections). I think this is mostly a truthful account of how Westover perceived events in her life. Possibly exaggerated, but who knows except for Tara what she endured? Perception is reality, and this is her reality. Mostly, I am pretty awed by her resilience and drive.Recommended to those who enjoyed Jeanette Walls' ""The Glass Castle.""Thanks to NetGalley and Random House Publishing Group for an ARC of this knockout of a memoir. My review, However, is based on the hardcover version."

I think this is one of the best, if not the best, memoirs I've read. I want to tell you that I loved this book, but I don't know if ""love"" is the right word because it was a hard story to read at times - for all kinds of different reasons. What I loved about it was that it was a story of becoming - of finding yourself and your own story. There were so many times I had to stop to tell Aaron something that had happened as I was reading either because it was so crazy (either awesome or terrible or almost unbelievable). I love a book that encourages us to challenge our assumptions about the beliefs we grew up with and find ourselves within (and owning) our own individual story - whether we continue to believe or walk away or distance ourselves or reconnect.

158,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7630898-bonnie-brody,Rating 1 out of 5,"It isn't often that I get as irritated with a book as I did with 'Educated'. The author, Tara Westover, appears to have a mnemonic memory going back to her early childhood. She relates conversations and events that occurred when she was barely past her toddler years, something I find very difficult to believe. She also shows very little emotionality as she describes her horribly dysfunctional and abusive family. Of course, children can't always identify abuse when it occurs, but supposedly the author has gone past it and is now aware of how different her childhood was from the norm.The author relates how she grew up in rural Idaho with a survivalist and mentally ill father. Her mother suffered a serious head injury when the author was little and appears to have had chronic, long-lasting symptoms from this. Since her mother and father didn't believe in traditional medicine, the author's mother never saw a doctor. The author's parents didn't believe in traditional education and the author was erratically home schooled.The memoir is filled with contradictions and the author appears to bend over backwards to give a positive slant to her trauma. While I can understand how one tries to make sense of what is not rational, had the author truly gotten over her past, she would see her childhood for what it was - traumatic and abusive.I hope that Ms. Westover gets the help she needs so that she can be honest with herself and find freedom to thrive."
159,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8904243-jennifer-blankfein,Rating 5 out of 5,"Follow my reviews on booknationbyjen.wordpress.com The author’s coming of age in Educated is incredible, tragic, praiseworthy and monumental. From a young girl loving and believing everything her parents tell her to questioning their logic and actively pursuing different answers and other ways of thinking, Tara Westover has the inherent desire to know more. Reminiscent of The Glass Castle, Tara lives with her survivalist family in the mountains of Idaho, and similar to Leah Remini’s account of her time as a scientologist in Troublemaker, Tara begins to realize all she is told may not be the truth and although she is fiercely loyal to her parents and siblings she feels trapped and begins to question their nonconventional, way of life.Growing up working in a junkyard with her dad, helping her mom with her herbs and fighting off her violent brother, it is shocking, admirable and hopeful to hear about Tara’s experiences as she takes the initiative to study her way to a decent grade on the ACT, ultimately getting herself in to college and beyond. Growing up with some mormon values, anti-government, no schooling, never visited a doctor, and spending days preparing for the end of the world, her naivety is expected but concurrently astounding; she had never taken a test before, didn’t understand a reading assignment of a chapter meant you needed to actually read the words on the pages, had no idea what the Holocaust was; she had virtually no knowledge of the world outside of her family, the mountain and what her parents told her.Westover’s account was enriched with surprisingly intelligent, sophisticated and well written prose. (I kept thinking how she never went to school until college and how for me, in the world I live in, formal education in the formative years seems crucial at the time children are developing. Clearly one can catch up on reading and writing skills and learn curriculum later on, but the social interaction, independence and decision making tactics we learn in a school environment, providing experiences, may be more important.) Her devotion and loyalty to her large family, her abusive brother and her controlling father in particular, caused personal conflict and forced Tara to make painful decisions which allowed her to flourish but continued to leave her with questions.“When I was a child, I waited for my mind to grow, for my experiences to accumulate and my choices to solidify, taking shape into the likeness of a person. That person, or that likeness of one, had belonged. I was of that mountain, the mountain that had made me. It was only as I grew older that I wondered if how I had started is how I would end – if the first shape a person takes is their only true shape.”Tara takes us through the complexity of her relationships, and when thinking about her father and his strength and conviction as a leader of the family, it makes me think, aside from his mental illness, he came from a place of love. We all work with what we have, and if what we have is limited and we are not open to learning more, we can appear to be stubborn and ill informed, making poor choices. An open mind and a thirst for learning can bring people together, enlighten and revitalize. A small mind with no will to become more educated and hear other opinions can lead to either submission (drinking the Kool Aid) or conflict and rebellion. Tara loved her parents and as she became educated, she was able to see their small mindedness and unfortunately that disparity broke them apart.Educated is a powerful account of Tara Westover’s life, from living as a survivalist on a mountain in Idaho to attending Bringham Young University, Harvard and Cambridge and earning a PhD. She is extremely accomplished and a wonderful writer. Educated is available February 20th. "

Gene Westover, a devout Mormon man, wants to be left alone to live modestly, stay off the government's grid, homeschool his children, practice faith-healing and prepare for the End Days in the isolated foothills of Idaho. His wife is submissive to his authority as she feels a good Christian woman should be and works as an unlicensed mid-wife and herbalist, busy cooking up meals and healing salves. Little time for any of that homeschooling stuff though. Tara Westover is their youngest child: ""I'd always known that my father believed in a different God. For as long as I could remember, I'd known that the members of my own family were the only true Mormons I had ever known. As a child, I'd been aware that although my family attended the same church as everyone in our town, our religion was not the same. They believed in modesty; we practiced it. They believed in God's power to heal; we left our injuries in God's hands. They believed in preparing for the Second Coming; we were actually prepared.""Now as an adult she has questions: ""I don't understand why I wasn't allowed to get a decent education as a child."" With their hit-or-miss homeschooling, it is remarkable that Tara scores a 28 on her ACT test on the second attempt and is accepted to BYU where she is totally at sea, not knowing how to study or write an essay. She had never heard of the Holocaust and thought Europe was a country but she had read the Bible and the Book of Mormon!While taking Psychology 101, Tara says she came to the realization that her father is quite possibly bipolar, and another professor suggests schizophrenia when he hears the details of her father’s behavior. She realizes she and her siblings are doubly at risk for mood disorders because of genetics and the stressful environment in which they were raised. Her brother Shawn is a prime example of this as he is both mentally and physically abusive. She questions: ”Why would you fight so hard against made-up monsters, but do nothing about the monsters in your own house?"" Her mother later says, ""You were my child. I should have protected you.” Yes, most assuredly she should have—not only from the abuse in the home but also from life-endangering work situations in the father’s business. Not all government regulations and safety requirements are bad!I am really not a huge fan of memoirs but I’ve read quite a few and found this one fascinating, even if only half of what she writes is true. In that case, you really have to give Tara some high marks for achieving what she has. But I think we have all learned over the years to take memoirs with a grain of salt. Memories can be selective and faulty—siblings can remember things quite differently. A quick Google search will reveal that there is some conflict with her family over this book. There are also some family photos available if you are interested in such things."

Tara Westover is raised on the side of a mountain in Idaho. She's one of seven, working on a junkyard for the family. Her father- the ruler of the house struggles with mental illness and deeply believes that the government is part of the illuminati and just exists to brainwash people-- the Others. They prepare for the end of the world, as it can happen at any point and the family must be ready for it. Tara hasn't set foot in any school, and doesn't possess a birth certificate. Her mother is a midwife that starts to hone her craft in homeopathy. Her relationship with her family is a constant source of struggle throughout her life. Choices that she battles over and over again. Her life's journey so far is one that is commendable and so improbable, my jaw kept dropping at some of the events that took place in her lifetime. Situation after situation of danger and emergencies border the periphery of Tara's life. Tara eventually teaches herself and gets into BYU, which only leads to more familial struggle and education on how to rise above. As if Tara's story itself isn't incredible enough, the writing of this book is outstanding. Her writing deserves the audience she is receiving right now. Carefully telling her life's history in a way that engages the reader and crafting beautiful sentences and phrases almost as majestic as the mountain itself. So many lines I wanted to read all over again or jot down to remember later. I commend Tara for the strength to believe in herself and to leave everything she grew up with behind in order to reach her goals. I cannot wait to see what Tara Westover creates next. Bravo!"

I mean, it's absolutely not surprising, but to read a first hand account of it is still eye opening. I am not sure how Tara managed to catch up and excel to such a high degree educationally, but perhaps her unusual background makes her think differently than others and thus succeed in making new connections for her research/thesis? Not that that she would have willingly paid the price she did for that unique mindset I am sure. This is a story of achievement, but also heartbreaking neglect, abuse, gas lighting, and estrangement. Definitely worth reading - this is not a dry non-fiction book."
163,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,Rating 5 out of 5,"I thought was one of the most extraordinary books I have ever read.  Westover's childhood and adolescence were lived in an deeply dysfunctional, violent, fundamentalist Mormon family. Her father was a diehard survivalist, anti-government, anti-doctors, anti-school and learning, and he hoarded food, petrol and guns. Most of his children didn't have birth certificates. He believed that everyone who wasn't rigidly fundamentalist was influenced by some vast sinister force he called “the Illuminati”.He ran a scrapyard, disposing of old cars and suchlike, using large and unwieldy machinery. He was also impervious to physical risk and danger, often exposing himself and his family to horrendous accidents – and when these happened he went to extraordinary lengths to keep them them out of hospital, whilst their mother treated them with home-made ointments and herbs, combined with an eccentric ritual involving hand clicks that she had intuited for herself. The fact the family survived these incidents was incredible. They must have been outstandingly tough on all levels - and they survived at the cost of heavy scars, both mental and physical.Most of the children were brought up with no schooling. Westover was taught to read when when she was four, but all the rest of her meagre childhood education was self taught. 
Mother had given up homeschooling by then, but still had a computer, and there were books in the basement. I found the science book, with its colorful illustrations, and the math book I remembered from years before. I even located a faded green book of history. But when I sat down to study I nearly always fell asleep. The pages were glossy and soft, made softer by the hours I'd spent hauling scrap. When Dad saw me with one of those books, he'd try to get me away from them..... Perhaps he thought if he could just distract me for a few years, the danger would pass. So he made up jobs for me to do, whether they needed doing or not. One afternoon, after he'd caught me looking at the math book, he and I spent an hour hauling buckets of water across the field to his fruit trees, which wouldn't have been at all unusual except it was during a rainstorm.""
But she did have one source of learning, one that undoubtedly stood her in good stead in the years to come....the Bible and Mormon readings. 
 I didn't study history or math. I studied religion. I read the Book of Mormon twice. I read the New Testament, once quickly, then a second time more slowly, pausing to make notes, to cross-reference, and even to write short essays on doctrines like faith and sacrifice. No one read the essays; I wrote them for myself... I worked through the Old Testament next, then I read Dad's books, which were mostly compilations of the speeches, letters and journals of the early Mormon prophets. Their language was of the nineteenth century—stiff, winding, but exact—and at first I understood nothing. But over time my eyes and ears adjusted, so that I began to feel at home with those fragments of my people's history: stories of pioneers, my ancestors, striking out across the American wilderness. While the stories were vivid, the lectures were abstract, treatises on obscure philosophical subjects, and it was to these abstractions that I devoted most of my study. In retrospect, I see that this was my education, the one that would matter: the hours I spent sitting at a borrowed desk, struggling to parse narrow strands of Mormon doctrine..... The skill I was learning was a crucial one, the patience to read things I could not yet understand
From this situation of virtually zero formal education, she got herself into a Mormon university. It was a struggle. She was ignorant in so many different respects - from knowing the niceties of everyday society, to knowing about issues of major 20th century history – like the Holocaust. She learnt fast though, and fortunately one of the professors recognised her intelligence, and with his encouragement she she won a scholarship to Cambridge. There they asked her to stay on and do a PhD in history......and from there she went on to became a writer in residence at Harvard, where I think she is still working now. For me, more than anything else, the book explores the tenacious and obsessive enmeshment that we sometimes have with our families. The antidote (for Westover at least) was the amazing liberation that education can offer – but it didn't work instantly. Time and time again she returned to the toxic bosom of her family, her driven fundamentalist father, her weak mother who inevitably ended up propping up her husband, and her sadistic brother, who frequently made her the subject of this violent outbursts. I suspect that Westover has a streak of tenacity that may well have been inherited from her father. I think someone less determined to right their relationship would perhaps have been able to leave the family just a bit sooner. Her tie with her father is deep and grasping, and she felt a lot of guilt too. This was often when she behaved in ways that most of society would applaud, like on the one occasion she took one of her badly injured brothers to hospital 
“Sitting across from me is my father, and as I look into his worn face it hits me, a truth so powerful I don’t know why I’ve never understood it before. The truth is this: that I am not a good daughter. I am a traitor, a wolf among sheep; there is something different about me and that difference is not good. I want to bellow, to weep into my father’s knees and promise never to do it again. 
Ultimately, she does manage to leave her family, but it's because they walk away from her, not the other way round. She retains contact with two of her brothers, who amazingly also escaped by working their way into university, and she gets on very well with them.I'd like to end by mentioning an excellent You Tube discussion with her at Harvard last year. (It lasts about 1 hour with Q & A). In it she mentions the importance of support and understanding she got from some of her fellow students, in spite of the fact that in the early years of university she had bizarre and bigoted ideas. It's a plea for all of us to be more generous with those who don't share our views.https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_co..."

I just knew that it was high time I read this. I listened to the audio, and Julia Whelan’s narration was superb. I flew through it in two days. In fact, I devoured it.Tara Westover’s family was one of extremism. Living on a farm made possible from grandparents, Tara did not know what education was while she followed the rules as a youngster and did her many chores. Her grandparents were not so extreme, there was a little less resistance there; she was allowed cow’s milk at breakfast time there (instead of water), in retaliation from her father’s preaching against it (don’t ask me which bible story this was taken from). Snippets such as this show (to me) the warped sense of thinking, but this was just a tiny taste. Tara states from the start she is not saying the Mormon religion is right or wrong. She stated that at age 7 she knew she was different, because they were not allowed to go to school. Four of the seven lacked a birth certificate. This memoir was so raw and honest, that many times she mentions that she is not sure of the memories, and that years after the events, many of the family’s memories differ as to the outcome, or how they got there. I feel she was always honest in her many stories. As I looked for this remarkable woman online after finishing the book, she mentions many times that she was certainly loved by her parents, if not very misguided. What happened to this girl, and the way she was bought up, along with her six siblings makes me truly wonder about that. The violence from one brother, bestowed upon her, and another sister is one example. The parents showed not to be bothered by this. I was appalled. Tara’s writing showed such honesty that there was no mistaking this. It was so worrying.She rose from no education, taught herself mathematics basics and gained her way into university after never attending high school. Brother Tyler helped her with this. He seemed to be one of the siblings that supported her throughout. Her parents did not believe in education, although it seems the elder siblings dipped in and out, but getting the work done in the scrapyard was more important, and education was forgotten when it came to Tara. Tara asked in one of her College classes ‘what does that mean?’ when raising her hand. The word she did not know was holocaust. This story tells of extreme views, shocking farmyard accidents through ignorance and neglect and a complete abandon from any type of traditional medical treatments. Doctors were shunned and through countless near-death experiences involving the whole family, the mothers herbalism and spiritual energy healing was all they used. This is now a thriving business, so it seems their lack of trust in the government has been allowed to make a way for a very successful business that is being run today. The website states the humble beginnings to now and it is run using all the usual social media outlets. This is very curious to me. What happened to this anti-government stance? I didn’t want my review to show my frustration in Tara’s family, but the story presented (again, to me), such a warped view of life and faith. Her parents talked of God’s work in every moment they could, but it did not follow through to their actions. The stories of miracles espoused from her parents at any chance they could get seemed to a Chinese whisper effect, the more the story told, the more fanciful and truth lacking to support their claims. Tara graduated College, made her way to Cambridge and Harvard, with one Professor stating one of Tara’s essays being the best writing he had seen. She now is a senior research fellow, and of course, successful memoirist. I don’t know how she did it. From scrapping in the family junkyard, where she was many times almost killed, to a highly educated woman, and to think she had to guess her birthdate and chase down a birth certificate to apply for school.Due to the families extremism and Tara’s journey, she is now estranged from them. There are mentions of her being evil from time to time, and I don’t know why someone would make that up. This review was not meant to be so lengthy, but so complex is Tara's story this is how it ended up. I am late to the party for this memoir, I’d recommend it for those who’ve looked at it but not yet taken the plunge. I recommend it highly."

From the moment I started reading, I was so engaged and drawn into Tara Westover’s story that I found it impossible to put this book down – a first for me with a nonfiction book! Actually, throughout the entire time I was reading, I had to remind myself constantly that this was not a novel, not some fictional coming-of-age tale about a girl who was able to rise above her circumstances and carve out an existence for herself despite everything that happened, because in all honesty, this absolutely read like a novel. Tara’s story is truly amazing and I’m glad she got the chance to tell it-- the way she was able to get an education for the first time at the age of 17, even being able to study at Cambridge and Harvard and eventually earning her PhD, was absolutely inspiring! I appreciate the raw honesty with which she relayed her story and am impressed by the tremendous strength and courage that it undoubtedly took for her to lay bare her inner conflicts and struggles so vividly for us, also going to great lengths to clarify the details and events that were part of her own memory versus the ones that were not. As we were exposed to one harrowing incident after another and bore witness to the destructive behavior and actions of Tara’s parents – her religious fanatic survivalist father and meek, subservient mother – there were moments where I wanted this story to be a work of fiction because it was so hard to come to terms with all the cruelty and abuse that went on. It felt surreal at times, witnessing this family’s brutality – more specifically the father and one of the brothers -- spurred by an unwavering, cult-like adherence to an ideology that obviously defied logic as well as all common sense yet was embraced so wholeheartedly and unquestioningly. Tara never once used the word “cult” in her memoir and it is unclear whether she ever thought of her family as such, but the way she described her parents, especially later on with how powerful they became and all the “employees” who not only worked for them but also admired them and adapted their ideology, it is obvious to any outside observer that’s what her family eventually became. In this regard, I can’t help but worry for Tara, with the publication of this memoir, what her future will look like, especially knowing that her journey is far from over and she continues to struggle with reconciling the new life she built for herself against the love and loyalty she still has for her family. And this is the one area – Tara’s continued sense of loyalty to her family – that made me struggle with rating this book and, to a certain extent, writing this review. I absolutely felt for Tara and it was heartbreaking what she went through, but at the same time, it was very difficult for me to reconcile her constant need to still seek validation from her family even after everything that happened. She acknowledged herself that her parents were abusive, manipulative, maniacal to the point of delusional, and their lifestyle was one that she no longer wanted to be a part of -- her parents, for their part, also made it clear that her refusal to conform and submit to their ideology meant that she was “no longer welcome” in the family and they wanted nothing to do with her anymore either -- yet despite all this, somehow, Tara is still not able to let go. The part where she talked about writing to her mother every year and basically “begging for approval” to see her was tough to read and in all honesty, frustrated me to no end. Even though her family outright rejected her time and time again and she already knew it was “pointless” to continue reaching out to her family and making the trip back to her family’s compound every year, she still continued to do it – almost as though, despite knowing the impossibility of it, she was hoping for some divine miracle that her family might one day “come around” and change their ways. While part of me definitely understands the difficulty of cutting ties with family and empathizes with the conflicting emotions that Tara continues to struggle with, another part of me can’t help wondering whether someday, she might succumb and everything she worked so hard to achieve – the education and new life -- may be in vain. I’m pretty sure there will be more to this story in the future and I can only hope that whatever happens, Tara can continue to find her inner peace and happiness. Overall, this was a tough read, but a powerful one and so very important! It opened my eyes to so many things and I know Tara’s story will continue to stay with me for a long time to come. Highly recommended and necessary read!! Received ARC from Random House via NetGalley"
167,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/99765491-jimz,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was a real page-turner. I read it in one day. So I have to give credit to Tara Westover for how she wrote this ~330 page memoir. It was engaging and interesting for the majority of the book. That is the principal reason for my 4 stars.Her brother Shawn (a pseudonym) really comes out as a scary person in this memoir. One wonders if his wife and his two children are OK. In the book he stabbed a family dog to death while his little child was watching, and the child was screaming. That was on top of the repeated violent assaults he perpetrated on Tara, shoving her face in a toilet bowl, yanking her hair and dragging her, etc. Verbally threatening her life. Good God.The father also comes across as a derelict caregiver putting her, when she was growing up, in very dangerous situations with his junkyard/welding businesses. And I did not see any degree of love shown to her by him. The mother stood by and let all this stuff happen. At one point Tara thought her mother would defend her, but then the mother retreated and sided with Shawn and her husband (stand by your man approach).So here’s one thing I am curious about: although she used first name pseudonyms for Shawn, and her mother and father, we the readers know they live in Idaho and their last names are Westover, they have a thriving herbalist business, and they live in the mountainous area with one peak named Buck’s Peak (located in sec 19,T14S,R38E, Boise Meridian, Franklin County). So we as readers pretty much know where these people are located. Not that I care…but I guess I just wonder why Tara didn’t make up some fictitious area to protect their privacy…or was that her intent to let the whole wide world know where they live? I have a suspicion after reading all the GR reviews and the reviews from periodicals and such, or maybe from anybody who is reading this review, that I will get a better picture of what’s going on here.Tara says she was not aware of the Holocaust before she arrived on one of the college campuses she was at. That may be true, but it seems odd that her father late in the book was railing about how the Jews concocted the Holocaust — one would think this was something he railed about throughout Tara’s life so I am just surprised she first became aware of the Holocaust only after leaving her domicile for college. In preparation for reading the memoir, I read the synopsis in the inside front cover, and it gave me the impression that none of the children growing up (were there 7 of them?) had ever set foot in a classroom, and that they were “isolated from mainstream society”. But I do believe some of the kids had started elementary grade school (I think the older ones?), and it seems like they all had dealings with the outside world. The father owned a junk yard. They went to Arizona on several occasions…she had one set of grandparents at the foot of the mountain. It wasn’t like she was living in a cave all of her life. My point is I don’t know how isolated she really was.The book is called “Education.” And I think one of the main points is that she felt she was robbed of an education for the first 17 years of her life. But then if she wasn’t educated (even home schooling) it just seems remarkable to the point where it strains credulity that she was able to graduate with her bachelor’s degree at age 22. That’s an approximate age when children who went through a regimented K-12 education graduate from college (could be as early as age 21). That would indicate to me she was a genius. Maybe she is a genius. I am just raising some points that I wasn’t clear about in my mind. Bottom line for me is that it was an engrossing read and kudos to her for writing such an interesting book. 😊"

169,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2069203-reading-is-my-hustle,Rating 4 out of 5,"I have not read a book that made me this uncomfortable in a long time. Born to survivalist Mormons, Tara grows up ""homeschooled"" in Idaho. Much of her childhood is spent working for her father in the family junkyard. There are multiple horrific accidents that various siblings experience because her father is not big on safety (safe in the knowledge that G*d will protect & heal them). Reading about the burns, head injuries, & puncture wounds made me feel wrathful. Injuries & illnesses were treated at home with some combination of herbs, tinctures, or salves. The kids suffered tremendous pain needlessly & it made me nuts. There was also emotional & physical abuse that Tara experiences at the hands of one of her brothers. Her parents do nothing to protect her. That part of the story was so upsetting I cannot even write about it. Thankfully she heads off to BYU at 16 & her life begins to change. Reading how she managed to survive her family was a HARROWING experience. Seeing her carve out a life for herself was AMAZING. Education for the win."
170,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23100707-jean,Rating 3 out of 5,A friend loaned me this book because she was impressed by Westover’s story. Tara Westover’s memoir is about growing up in Idaho. Her father is a survivalist. That is the term the publisher chose to use. I would have used a different term. She was isolated and never attended school. She was the youngest of seven children. The book is well written. I was impressed with her drive to survive and learn on her own. She is an example of a person’s will to learn. She managed to learn on her own from books. I found her father’s various items of society that he would use or reject interesting and made no philosophical sense. There are many reviews of this book so I will keep this short. The book is worth reading to learn to what extent a person will go to learn.I read this as a hardback book. It is 334 pages published by Random House Publishing Company.

**4.5 stars** ‘“I can help,” he said, “but you’ll need to tell me what’s bothering you.” His voice was gentle, and that gentleness was cruel. I wished he would yell. If he yelled, it would make me angry, and when angry I felt powerful. I didn’t know if I could do this without feeling powerful.I cleared my throat, then talked for an hour.’
I was debating quite some time if I needed to be as frank as I’m about to be in my review, for it will make crystal-clear the level of my ignorance to a humiliating level. I knew of quite some detailed accounts of religious fanatics in Islam and Hinduism (and truth be told I could've done without them, though I feel it's necessary to know), but never in Christianity. That people can ‘rise’ to sink to that level, somehow still remains shocking to me even after reading through the works of Khaled Hosseini and Taslima Nasrin and many others, and the degree of discomfort varies with every account. For Westover ‘zoo’, it reached almost ninety degrees three-fifth through the pages.Where this novel lags a bit, is the storytelling, despite its immense readability. Not talking about the unusual amount of brilliant attention to detail or metaphorical references every once in a while, it does suffer a bit too much through over-repeating near the end, so much so I decided to speed things up a bit. Somehow, it felt ridiculous how she could be so glued to that family, self-contradicting the fact that she told multiple times she didn’t feel anything at all. Other than that, the storytelling is pretty much flawless for a debutant author. Another brilliant aspect of the story is that it adds to a brilliant perspective of feminism, almost on the same level as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. And on the matter of religious perspective and atheism which is in itself dubious and retold a bit too frequently (it often got pretty tiresome over the pages), it’s good that Westover evolved over the years so that when she finally wrote the book, she managed to insert a tone of greyish neutrality into it. It’s not preachy, and that’s a good thing. From time to time the tone turns humongous (in a subtle way, that's a good thing), and you may laugh out loud.
 ‘“Richard is a genius,” Dad told me a moment later, winking. “He’s five times smarter than that Einstein was. He can disprove all them socialist theories and godless speculations. He’s gonna get down there and blow up the whole damn system.”’
Another exceptional aspect of the book is how the moments of abuse are described in an unnerving, raw yet matter-of-fact tone. The credit, I think, goes more to the narrator Julia Whelan, I’m sure I might have felt the scream if I had read the physical copy only. I daresay it would have ruined the effect pretty much. It was punctuated, more than often by a tone of cold fury the likes of which I’ve recently only seen in Mariam in A Thousand Splendid Suns.
 ‘There was one point when he was forcing me from the car, that he had both hands pinned above my head and my shirt rose up. I asked him to let me fix it but it was like he couldn’t hear me. He just stared at it like a great big jerk. It’s a good thing I’m as small as I am. If I was larger, at that moment, I would have torn him apart.’
Truth be told, I was a bit apprehensive before picking this one up because firstly the reviews were way too dubious, and also, for the first time, I didn’t own a physical copy. Weird, I know, but I have been a bit of old-school in all these matters till now. So I followed for the first time the advice of a fellow bookstagrammer, and played the audiobook on my headphones while reading the eBook. Slow, but it does work.Summing it all up, it has been a pretty uncomfortable couple of days. I was left unsure, a bit too often if I really did want to continue reading after this incident, it's way too haunting without any further extensions. For almost the first quarter I had no idea of the devastations that were awaiting me in the form of deliberate traumatizing one’s own children, both psychologically and physically. True, I have read far more gory accounts of domestic violence, but this took everything to a whole different level with a father knowingly forcing his teenage daughter into frightening accident-prone works, demanding proofs of abuse or threatening to banish from kin, or all in all, a hypocritical upbringing of children through so many thorny bushes that, I was surprised that everyone made out of it alive. Quite a marvellous testimonial of rather salubrious writing skill that showcases an inspiring journey from an ignorant, traumatized and abused teenager to an independent woman who had inexplicably overcome her dire past. We all are left with a few scars.
 ‘But vindication has no power over guilt. No amount of anger or rage directed at others can subdue it, because guilt is never about them. Guilt is the fear of one’s own wretchedness. It has nothing to do with other people.’

176,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1213607-julie,Rating 4 out of 5,"I. Debuting (again)After presenting one of my novels last month to a large and long-standing book club, I was asked to join. This author hugged herself for joy and accepted membership with grace and glee, since she is trying to restart her life in a place where she's lived for several years, a small town where circles intersect and collide and she's forever running into herself, her recent past, her new present. What a joy to be in a collection of women new to her, who see her as person whole unto herself, not the ex-wife of so-and-so, not the ex-girlfriend of, 'Oh him. I know him,' not the present partner of the ex-boyfriend of the woman who... well, at least she doesn't live here anymore. Our pasts, circling around us with their ambivalent lessons, their ambiguous truths, memories recollected in different ways at different times by those who may have been present or who merely know someone who . . . Whose story is it to tell? II. DisappointmentI've yet to find a book club that has not ended in disappointment. I swore the last one, when I made a beautiful cake and everyone cancelled at the last minute, would be the last. It's been four years and a lifetime ago. I'm trying again. This group seems serious. III. DiscoveryOne of the joys about a great book club is being introduced to books I likely wouldn't read on my own. Despite the buzz, or perhaps because of it, I would have avoided Tara Westover's memoir, which struck me as one of those misery tales to be frustrated and exasperated by. An indeed it is. But it is so much more. IV. DismayEducated isn't about growing up Mormon. I think you'd probably learn more about the Church of Latter Day Saints watching a performance of The Book of Mormon. Westover's memoir is about growing up in the shadow of profound mental illness—her father's—and the Stockholm Syndrome-like effects it had on Westover, his six siblings, and her enabling and imprisoned mother. Combing through numerous reviews and interviews of the book and its author, I come across much questioning of the veracity of events in Educated. The calamities, injuries, and profound intellectual isolation of the Westover family do strain credulity for much of this finely-wrought narrative. Westover herself tries to cut doubt off at the pass by expressing her uncertainty of how these many dramas unfolded, checking and rechecking with her siblings and others on the periphery of this large and strange family, admitting that there are multiple avenues to memory. I've worked with authors struggling through memoir and a few of them I have advised to turn their personal tales into fiction. It would ease the telling and allow them freedom to express their stories without fear or being held to details they can't quite recall or are too bound by familial or friend loyalty to share. Basically, their stories would be better as novels than as memoirs. Westover's, however, would simply be ridiculous. It would be something you'd throw at the wall for its impossibility and strangling of disbelief. Truth, as they say, is stranger than fiction. We are enraptured by her family's crazy train, horrified by the violence, mortified that these people could be crushed, impaled, burned, smashed and still go on in defiance of modern medicine and common sense, all in thrall of a narcissistic madman. V. DeterminationWestover found her way out, an autodidact who filled in the holes of the Swiss-cheese home schooling with study in the sly. Success with the ACT got her into Brigham Young University, where she discovered the Holocaust and Martin Luther King, Jr. In a short time, she went on to complete fellowships at Cambridge and Harvard, and a Ph.D at Cambridge. She is now just 32. There is something incomplete about Educated. It is a crisp, lucid and lyrical recitation of events, riveting in content and skilled in narrative pacing and structure. Yet, Westover has only recently removed herself from the core of this strange and destructive family, not only her bizarre parents, but several of her siblings, including Shawn, her torturer. What's missing is an emotional depth and resonance that comes from reflection and distance. The reader only gets a sense of Tara Westover as a complete woman, perhaps because she's only recently begun to learn who that woman is, separate from her past. VI. DecisionThe perfect book club read, Educated is sure to engender fascinating debate. Book Club met last night to discuss Rene Denfeld's outstanding The Child Finder, and those of us who'd already read Educated couldn't help but comment what a fascinating companion this made- another book examining memory, and how we find our way to love those who hurt us the most, and the costs and rewards of letting them go. Highly Recommended. "
177,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9827967-deb,Rating 5 out of 5,"I wonder how many who read this memoir will be reflecting on their own lives and the cataclysmic effects that at least one devastating narcissist has visited upon their innocence. Tara Westover’s memoir “Educated” is an especially gruelling rendition of this experience, layered by years upon years from early childhood within a family trapped by her dominating survivalist father and her gradually weakened enabling mother. The dynamics of disfunction are framed by a startling story, replete with a skewed version of Mormonism that empowered her father’s embellished grandiosity as an indisputable vessel of God. Tara escaped. The cost to her, however, is unimaginable to the average person. She refused her parents’ reality, and they disowned her as a result. Over and over again,until that point in the relationship, Tara tried to convince them of the abuse within the family, of the danger in their thinking and would return from her post secondary school opportunities to try to mend broken bonds. As any family scapegoat learns, eventually, the family that harms will never acknowledge anything, never know empathy and will only defend the perpetrator in its midst. Tara will never be free of the shifts that her brain takes between a reality defined by her parents and the larger world in which she now lives. She was injured, but is fortunate to have had brothers who were able to mentor her and lead her outside of her family mental imprisonment. As with so many survivors from severely damaged families, Tara was able to find connection and validation in her extended family - the few nearest her who can acknowledge her story without degrading her. Only the bravest survive life within a family with a malicious Narcissist at its head. Kudos to Tara for telling her story, so impeccably. Her “education” has been hard won and is worth reading about. Five stars."
178,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18333933-klinta,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a heartbreaking story worth reading, but the fairy tale-ish core pushed me away from it and at the end, I'm not sure I liked the whole story. Perhaps it is simply my human nature and envy. I was hooked from the beginning, but my interest started to wane around the middle. It seemed like I had an easier time to relate to the abusive and horrible childhood the girl had than the great achievements she reached later in life. The writing, I thought, was very good, it flowed so seamlessly. It's hard to imagine that people still live and are allowed to live like this. Mention of 'Obamacare' just makes one realise how recent all this is. This book reminded me of my childhood, what I experienced and how different people's childhood years are. It also made me remember how I used to believe adults, thinking they knew everything (only growing up made me realise that many truths I believed in as a child were wrong). "

180,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is going to be one of those probably-useless-for-anyone-else reviews because a book like this hits so many of my personal buttons that I can't really talk about it objectively or help describe what kind of reader will enjoy it. This is usually what I try to do, but here I'm simply incapable of doing it.My personal experience is not very similar to Westover's at all, but once she begins her education she goes to BYU, which is where I went for undergrad and law school. I spent so much of the book thinking about how I would have seen her had I been there with her. (This thought experiment didn't portray me in a very good light. I would surely have kept my distance.) I also thought a lot about how ill-prepared the Mormon church is to help people like Westover who may have been marked present for her church meetings but who was brought up in a family that pushed their doctrines well past the extreme to the extent that they become a danger to themselves and those around them. And, of course, I thought about our education system, our general society, how we do not know how to help those who aren't brought up in what we deem acceptable circumstances, the impossible odds one must overcome when you haven't been given a traditional life. There's a lot to think about here and Westover presents it all to you without hitting you over the head with these questions.I wasn't prepared for just how harrowing this book would be. The family Westover comes from isn't just extreme in their religious doctrines, but extreme in many other ways. They are heavily patriarchal, constantly preparing for the apocalypse, eschewing their own church and their own government as actively dangerous. It is a horrific place to be for anyone, but particularly for a young girl whose worth is immediately devalued and who is surrounded by men who are given free rein to abuse her physically and emotionally. I was expecting a tale of overcoming the odds, being a fish out of water. I was not prepared for just how brutal Westover's home life would be. And I was even less prepared for how she kept voluntarily stepping back into it.If you've experienced trauma from your family, if you're estranged from your family, this is probably going to be a very difficult book for you and it may be worth skipping entirely. Over and over again I just wanted to tell the author to take care of herself and stay away from her family. I just wanted her to understand that the people who love you can also be those who hurt you the most, and I found myself constantly anxious about her safety and her mental health. In particular Westover's brother is physically abusive and threatening to an extent that I wasn't prepared for.I held off on this book for a long time because I avoid books about fundamentalist Mormonism. Most readers equate the extremes of fundamentalism with traditional Mormonism and don't really see where they overlap and where they diverge. I'm particularly sensitive to it as I grew up Mormon outside of a heavily Mormon area, so these were the things I was teased about as a child. Even as an ex-Mormon now, I still get well-meaning but ill-informed questions and comments. Books about fundamentalists are popular and salacious but rarely present a full context because to present one is impossible for someone who knows one version of the church, without understanding what makes it different from the church regular people are familiar with. This is, to be totally honest, another one of those books. There are ways in which Westover understands how she differs, understands that her beliefs are more extreme than others. But there are norms in Mormonism that she can't understand and her readers who also don't understand will think they're now more informed about Mormonism when actually the waters have only been muddied even more. I was very acutely aware every time this happened, every time a nuance of Mormon culture was flattened through Westover's perspective. It is not her job to explain these things, I'm not mad at her about it, but it's tricky to continue to see stories of extremism be the only stories that ever come out of Mormon culture into the broader culture. (See also the large number of reviews here who describe Westover's family as ""devout"" rather than ""extremist"" or ""fundamentalist."")Ultimately I was curious about what it must be like to attend BYU after growing up in a fundamentalist household removed from mainstream Mormonism as well as mainstream education. And that was a lot of what I enjoyed most about the book. Whenever Tara was away from her family I could relax and enjoy the book. Whenever she went back I felt tense and worried.Westover is a skilled writer, she does a lot of really smart things in this book. Surely she is still discovering new things about the world, still finding things she does not know, but she does not make the book a constant parade of discovery. She knows exactly how her mental state was all along the way and presenting a world we understand through eyes that can barely grasp it provides the reader with a wondrous new perspective on the world. She lets us see the slow steps she makes to understanding. The title is accurate and yet also inaccurate. Westover's education does not make up the bulk of the book. This is ultimately a book about family and about learning to move beyond the world your family has built for you in the most extreme way. "
181,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13086055-jay-schutt,Rating 4 out of 5,"You've heard the saying that ""truth can be stranger than fiction"" right? Well, this book was a paradoxical enigma to me (if that's a real thing, I don't know), but this story didn't seem real to me. The author either has led a fairytale life (certainly with good fairies watching over her in the latter part of the story) or this was one great hoax. So I decided to listen to an NPR ""Fresh Air"" interview with Dave Davies and the author after I finished the book to get more of an insight into Westover's life. I have never felt the need to do this ever before. I recommend to anyone who wants to read or has already read this book to listen to this interview.My early thoughts of this book were that it spent way too much time describing her dysfunctional/survivalist/abusive enabling/radical Mormon family and too little about her life away from her family from 17 years old on through her only formal education at Brigham Young University, Cambridge in England and Harvard University earning a PhD. in history.My thoughts of rating this book went from 2 stars to 3 stars and then finally coming to the realization that this was a 4 star read. A miraculous turn around for me for a miraculous story. I was educated. "

183,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7862560-la-canter,Rating 3 out of 5,"""Memories... may be beautiful and yet,What's too painful to rememberWe simply choose to forget."" Thank you, Barbara Streisand and the songwriters. The trouble with reviewing or analyzing a memoir (as opposed to a novel or work of nonfiction) is that one cannot legitimately nit pick what a person remembers. Or misremembers. In the afterword to the book, the author Westover acknowledges that she and various family members have significantly different recollections of a major family crisis. You'd think that an emotional and pretty catastrophic event would sear itself into one's memory like a fiery branding iron, but your thinking and mine would be wrong.Anybody who's heard of The Innocence Project or read Picking Cotton: Our Memoir of Injustice and Redemption can tell you that human recollection is a seriously flawed thing. Heck, if you watched My Cousin Vinny you'd know that. While we readers of Educated will be inclined to swallow it whole like nonfiction, there are no references or documents to confirm the details. I'm no judge or jury, but a memoir is merely hearsay.There were so many little discrepancies in Westover's story that they kept jolting me out of her story. We get the feeling that her family was impoverished on one hand, but her father was awarded major money-making contracts from companies and utility companies. He paid for all the damages to other folks' property, replaced smashed vehicles, and more well before his wife became a baroness of essential oils. He despised the government, but paid his taxes. They were survivalists with cable TV and cell phones. The kids were barely homeschooled, and yet three of the seven kids went on to acquire PhDs. The author had no knowledge about the Holocaust, but when she was in her 20s and her father went on ad nauseum about The Protocols (papers that allege that the Jewish people orchestrated WWII and their peoples' own incarceration and deaths in the camps), she remembered hearing these same tidbits and assumed it was from Dr. Kerry's history class. If her dad had been spouting religion-related hatred her entire life, would it not be likely that she heard about the Jews and the Holocaust at home? She asserts she knew nothing about it until being enrolled at BYU. Am I calling this author a fibber? No way. But do I doubt the memories of an emotionally abused adult who continues to repeatedly return to those who've harmed her? Yep. I love an unreliable narrator in novels, but there’s got to be a sense of trust between me as a reader and somebody telling their life story. A memoir is a personal story that should read with emotion and human connection. Everybody and their mother is comparing this story with The Glass Castle, but for me, that is like comparing a small building with a home. Maybe I'm just a cold fish, but it felt like I was reading something written - not living it. When Jeannette Walls wrote her first book, I felt horrific anger toward her parents, and they were mild offenders compared to Westover's family members. Her brother Shawn read like the most villainous villain ever, just minus the evil tell-tale ""muahaha!"" Walls made me feel protective of her childhood self and conflicted about her folks - her father was both lovable and awful. In this particular story, the whole family came across as two dimensional for me - maybe because I was so distracted by the repeated caveats about possibly confused memories. I entirely salute the author for telling her story and wish her the best of things. My three star rating is not for her, but for the story-telling itself. She may indeed be as brilliant as her other PhD siblings, well-earned her spots with the Gates program and in her graduate studies. But being bright and having a bad past does not equate to being a good story teller. Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness and even the slippery A Million Little Pieces impacted me far more than this one. Meh."
184,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10732821-amy,Rating 2 out of 5,"I hate reviewing memoirs. Its hard to criticize someone's experiences.AND I'm not saying this is in anyway an inaccurate portrayal (I mean, who am I to say? I don't know this person at all. I'm just an asshole on the internet who read a book.)My biggest struggle with this story is getting over how improbable everything is. How does someone with no education make it to Cambridge and Harvard? Tara is obviously intelligent, but those are both extremely elite institutions with insane amounts of competition. Being intelligent is not the same as doing well academically.Hell, she essentially lucks into her place at BYU. I didn't take the ACT, the SAT is much more prevalent in my neck of the woods. So I am not an authority on the ACT in anyway. She scores a 28 which if I'm to understand is very high, but even she admits to basically guessing through the whole science section. Now maybe each section isn't weighted the same, but to me that's like taking the SAT and just guessing at random for the language section and somehow scoring a 1500 I struggled to understand how someone with no formal education not only made it through her freshman year, but fucking ACED it. I could get behind her failing and then finding a resource that taught her how to write an essay (which she was never really taught to do) or any of the basics of institutional education that she's missing and then turns it around to scrape by with Cs. But she aces everything and receives a FULL SCHOLARSHIP. Everything just falls into her lap. If everything happened as she states, she is just the luckiest person alive. Honestly, everyone depicted in this story is the LUCKIEST people alive. There were so many times reading this book when I would think, ""Oh no, this is too far gone. There is no way this person is surviving this."" But they do. There is never any consequences for their actions. Its no wonder no one ever changes, every insane idea they have never leads to anything bad happening. I find it strange how this family is depicted as extreme. I mean, yeah, its strange she doesn't have a birth certificate and they shun medical practices and generally safety practices, but they live in society. They aren't even as isolated as say, the Amish community. They have money, participate in society, they have electricity and watch cable. Sure they talk a lot about the Illuminati, but its hardly like they living off the land in back-country-no-where isolated from all of society. They can take care of a lot themselves (even in some cases where its surprising anyone if living to old age), but are they really ""survivalists""?Overall, I found Tara to be a frustrating narrator. I won't get into it as I'm pretty sure this is just because I struggle with placing myself in others' shoes so I tend to get very frustrated when they act in a way I can't wrap my mind around. And I didn't live in this kind of emotionally and physically abusive situation, I have no idea what kind of toll that takes on a person."
185,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,Rating 5 out of 5,"I reread ""Educated"" for a library book discussion, and found it again to be a fascinating memoir.Physical and emotional survival is at the heart of Tara Westover's memoir. She was the youngest of seven children whose family lived in the mountains of Idaho. Her father was a mentally ill religious fanatic and survivalist who distrusted the government, medical doctors, and traditional education. Her mother was a midwife, a herbal healer, and built up a business selling essential oils.At a young age the children had been forced to work in their father's scrap metal and construction businesses where they had to use unsafe machinery. Even when someone was severely injured or burned, they were treated by their mother since their domineering father would not allow them to go to the hospital. One older brother became so sadistic and violent that Tara feared for her life. Tara had kept journals from a young age, and referred to them when writing the book.Homeschooling only involved learning to read, grade school math, trips to the library, and Bible reading. One has to admire Tara's intelligence and willpower as she taught herself high school math and other subjects to prepare to take the ACT college entrance exam, encouraged by an older brother. Tara's first time in a classroom was when she started BYU at age seventeen with little understanding of history and the world outside their small town. Tara eventually received a PhD from Cambridge, and she writes in an engaging manner.Her adult life has been a duality--wanting to be close to her family, but also needing to practice self-preservation. Her father misused their Mormon faith and used religious rhetoric to control people, especially the women in the household. Tara's father and abusive brother said she was possessed by the devil, trying to psychologically make her doubt herself when she complained about her brother's painful abuse. It took years of counseling and education for Tara to get to the point emotionally where she is now. Although some family members back Tara up, and others have different memories of certain events, we have to remember that Tara is writing about her reality and she includes footnotes where there are conflicting views.It's heartbreaking to think that there are children living off the radar with no one to advocate for them. This is a book that is unnerving to read, but difficult to put down, because one fears what will happen next."

187,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7407123-pat,Rating 4 out of 5,"Tara Westover grew up in a devout Mormon household. Her father ruled the house with an iron fist, and there was no velvet glove! He didn't trust the Government so schools, doctors, insurance and so on were all verboten. Four of the seven children didn't even have birth certificates. As in many patriarchal religions females were lesser beings, useful only as broodmares and looking after their husbands and families. Only in the Westover household it was all a little more extreme. The father entertained them nightly with scripture reading and railing against the great satan and warning against the wages of sin.The children were not mistreated as such but certainly their upbringing was quite different to most of their peers. The children were expected to help with earning an income. The father worked on construction projects in the warmer months and, as the boys got older, they helped with this. In winter the father worked on his scrap yard sorting the metals for selling. Tara helped with this, it was dirty and dangerous work. There were many injuries which had to be treated by mother. Mother was a respected herbalist (of the homeopathic kind) and a midwife. Tara also had to help with this aspect. So that's the background. This poor girl just wanted to go to school but it was not looking promising. Then a really bad accident left the father badly injured and he got much harsher. School became a distant dream. One of Tara's brothers, Shawn, started to treat her badly and she grew quite scared of him. Education might be her salvation. How does a girl who has never been to school, whose home schooling included herbs and birthing babies but not much else get an education? She'd missed school completely and thought of applying to Brigham Young University (which I believe is run by Mormons) but how to gain entrance? She studied her ring off and passed the entrance test on her second attempt and off she went. By this stage I think she realised that pursuing this education would cause a serious rift with her family. And that is the crux of the story. Tara struggled to reconcile her religious values and her family's beliefs with her educated self. This caused her much heartache and distress. But with the support of some of her teachers she persevered, moving on to other illustrious institutions and continually broadening her horizons. I guess this story has many parallels in other, patriarchal societies such as strict muslim communities where girls and women have many roadblocks put in their way and education is not a priority for girls. It is such a pity that pockets of such communities still exist in so-called secular societies but there you have it. It was a powerful story of a hunger for knowledge and a determination to get it - even as it cost her dearly as her family never came to terms with it. The book was presented in three parts. Part 1 covered the early childhood and skipped around time wise. It was hard to follow in that respect and seemed a bit random and muddled and I thought it was unnecessarily long. I took a star off for this. The rest of the book was immaculate and written with such empathy and compassion. Well worth a read. Sorry for the long review but this book had quite an impact on me."
188,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3642045-sue,Rating 5 out of 5,"Now I understand why there has been so much talk, so much interest in Tara Westover’s Educated. It is quite an amazing memoir. As one of her later professors would label her, she is a sort of Pygmalion. The comparison is apt if Pygmalion grew up on the side of an Idaho mountain amidst scrap metal, with a father preaching the end times, and with her knowing that women can never be what men can be as dictated by her religion. This memoir begins with memories from early childhood, Tara’s love for her family tempered by her occasional fear of one of her brothers and awe of her father. There was no school, only a small amount of home schooling. There was no access to medicine...it was the devil’s work. Everything off the mountain was suspect, even relatives. As Tara grew older, she began to question her place in this world. Her struggle would last for years with it’s culmination being this book. I have heard many comments about this book in the time since it was published. For myself, I think it shows the struggle of a bright but unschooled mind to understand the conflicting evidence she has seen in the world around her as she grew up (to about 16) and tried to place herself in that family and as she knew she wanted to learn. She taught herself enough for acceptance to BYU!I am hesitant to say too much more because I really think it’s best reading Tara’s words and memories. She is a good writer and her habit of keeping journals for years undoubtedly helped her through this project. Her’s was not a “normal” childhood, or even adulthood for that matter, but there are universal truths within what she experienced and learns.This is the first book of Boston College’s new online book club. I haven’t been able to keep up with the discussion regularly but I will get back to it now."

It was positioned by some as a way to understand what is happening in America, and you certainly got to see a family that is off the grid and very poor. But I think it was much more a story about abuse. Emotional and physical, Tara's story is most impressive that not only did she break out and get an education, but she escaped the abuse from her father and brother that kept all the rest of her family in check. Her father in particular sounds like he has mental illness, and the consequences of his not getting care for that - because he was intentionally off the grid and doesn't trust doctors - was severe on his family.""Everything I had worked for, all my years of study, had been to purchase for myself this one privilege: to see and experience more truths than those given to me by my father, and to use those truths to construct my own mind. I had come to believe that the ability to evaluate many ideas, many histories, many points of view, was at the heart of what it means to self-create. If I yielded now, I would lose more than an argument. I would lose custody of my own mind. This was the price I was being asked to pay, I understood that now. What my father wanted to cast from me wasn’t a demon: it was me."""

I worried it would be a Glass Castle rerun with a Morman spin. It is so, so much more. Westover is smart and thoughtful and writes beautifully about growing up in the hills of Idaho and adjusting to the outside world as a young woman. She probes into the reasons for the actions of her family members and herself, so at varying points the memoir reads like a scary adventure story, philosophical treatise and psychological exposé. I loved the focus on Westover’s transformation into an educated person - and the wrenching choices that she made as a result."

Ao fim de dez anos, em Cambridge, obteve um doutoramento em História. Melhor do que isto nem na literatura fantástica, mas trata-se de um caso real. Sem dúvida — independentemente das facilidades do ensino norte-americano em comparação com o português — que a miúda é muito inteligente e esforçada. Mas não gosto dela. Como escritora não me diz nada; aborreceu-me com tantas repetições do mesmo assunto e pormenores de situações quotidianas com pouco interesse; as descrições dos vários acidentes ocorridos na família (com cabeças rachadas, miolos a escorrer, queimaduras graves e tudo curado em casa com mezinhas) não me impressionaram nem um pouco; os relatos de maus-tratos a que um dos irmãos (que numa página era o melhor do mundo e na seguinte o pior) a sujeitou deixaram-me indiferente. Como pessoa ainda gosto menos. Todo o romance é um lavar de roupa suja em que a família de Tara é exposta aos nossos olhos como gente cruel e mentalmente perturbada. No entanto, da vida da Santa Tara pouco sabemos além de ter sido uma vítima da família; um génio do estudo (mesmo coxa e com dores, por ter um dedo partido, conseguiu ter 100% num exame); uma pura inocente que aos quinze anos (no século XXI e com televisão em casa) pensava que engravidava só por olhar para os rapazes e, em todo o romance, não revelou ter tido qualquer relação amorosa — cheguei a supor que tinha um relacionamento com Drew mas nos agradecimentos Tara tem o cuidado de se lhe referir como amigo (não é que isto interesse muito, apenas seria uma demonstração da sinceridade de Tara). Na altura em que terminou este livro não vê os pais há anos, por ter decidido cortar relações com eles. Tara Westover, depois de se doutorar deixou de ser a miúda de dezasseis anos, que vivia com os pais e ""podíamos chamar muitas coisas a esta nova identidade. Transformação. Metamorfose. Falsidade. Traição. Eu chamo-lhe educação.""(Tara Westover)Eu chamo-lhe Ingratidão. Vaidade. Egoísmo. Traição. Porque a educação ensina-nos (ou deveria) a compreender os comportamentos dos outros, a aceitar os seus defeitos e a perdoar os seus erros. Principalmente aos nossos pais, que podem não ser o que gostaríamos que fossem mas que nos amam e, mesmo na sua ignorância, fizeram o seu melhor. Esta minha ""zanga"" com a mocinha, ao contrário da maioria dos leitores que a admira, talvez se deva à minha experiência pessoal e, por ""ter comido o pão que o diabo amassou"", sou pouco tolerante com pessoas que, ao tornarem-se importantes, desprezam a família e, ainda, escrevem romances a demonstrar o quanto são maravilhosas e inocentes. E o pior é quando eu não acredito na maior parte do que dizem. Se este fosse um romance de ficção teria gostado dele assim assim (3*). Não gostei (2*) por ser ""um caso da vida"", em que a sua autora, escondida sob uma capa de anjo, devassa a vida da sua família, algo que é para respeitar e manter em privado. É por ser impossível desligar a obra do autor que eu evito ler auto-biografias. E também porque a maioria das vidas reais são pouco interessantes."

I could feel from every word, from every sentence how personal and authentic this tale was. It has been a long time since I read such a straightforward and shocking yet gripping and powerful book.Untraditional childhood with no birth certificate or public school, being sheltered from world happenings and having almost zero knowledge of history, dealing with volatile family and their unconventional lifestyle... I couldn’t stop reading once Tara’s sheltered world clashed with the world out there when she entered school for the first time at the age of seventeen. Author didn’t take any shortcuts while writing her memoir and I ate it all up. 
„I had come to believe that the ability to evaluate many ideas, many histories, many points of view, was at the heart of what it means to self-create.“
For a debut, Educated has not only engaging content but also surprisingly beautiful prose. The writing flows easily and makes this book readable in the best way possible. I’m not sure if this book was a one time thing or not, but Tara Westover is definitely and author to look out for and I truly hope she tries her hand at writing a fiction as well. I rarely read memoirs, mainly because I struggle with the lack of storytelling in them since memoirs are usually full of only-telling-no-showing writing style. However, this memoir reads like a novel and the fact that it describes real events only strengthens the reading experience. So even if you are strictly a novel reader like me, I wholeheartedly recommend this book to you even though it is a nonfictional one. You won’t regret it!"
195,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1412404-lolly-k-dandeneau,Rating 5 out of 5,"via my blog: https://bookstalkerblog.wordpress.com/“There’s a world out there, Tara,” he said. “And it will look a lot different once Dad is no longer whispering his view of it in your ear.”The above quote is true, in a sense, for all children but more so in certain families. This was one of the most captivating memoirs I have ever read. Ideas can be dangerous, and children are nothing if not always at the mercy of their parents. They are our Gods, they rule the universe until we are able to fully think and decide for ourselves, but how do you do that when you’ve been conditioned? What about being kept out of school, taught to distrust everyone that doesn’t share your parents beliefs? Here is the truth, when your world is small and contained you are so much easier to control, to manipulate. Maybe all parents poison the minds of their children with their ideology, often not meaning too. We can’t be right all the time, and aren’t as progressive as we imagine. Every parent has allowed their prejudices to bleed into their children, well meaning or not- born out of fear or from horrible experience that colored our thoughts and those things can wreak havoc for life on our children, carried well into adulthood. How do we purge the rot and nurture the seeds of good our parents have placed inside of us? As with all of us, Tara Westover spent much of her life sifting through her education, life lessons, religious beliefs, etc. A child of survivalists, believing the end of times is always around the corner, forced to prep endlessly, that the rest of the world is full of sin, forbidden to be seen or treated by doctors (because God and nature heals, not man) barred from school (because it’s brainwashing) her father is first and foremost a faithful servant of God. Early on he has episodes, everyone must fall in line to his demands, even her mother forced into midwifery and healing. Her brother is brutally abusive, and abuse is something no one really understands until they’ve lived through it. Good, Bad… how do you make that separation with nothing to compare it to? You can only dissect things with what you are aware of, what do you do when it’s been drilled into you that all you can trust is your family, forced to view the entire world as ominous and evil?Tara, of course has an inborn feeling of right and wrong and an intelligence beyond what is ‘acceptable’ but there is a struggle with religion and the love she feels for her family. While her father has spent his life sure the rest of the world is a threat, out to brainwash godly people he himself is guilty of such. Be it an unamed illness in him or manical faith, a label changes nothing when behavior is enabled and beyond anyone’s control. Yes, any sane person would be horrified by the things she and her siblings were forced to do, things even strong grown men would be hardpressed to take on, and why does she see it through? Because parents are in control, there is no other option, and later to protect others. It does dawn on her that her life is hardscrabble and brutal, and as quoted above, when one of her brothers seeks a different way of life and escapes (which is a mean feat) she finds her own way out.Being out is a loaded thing too. Chosing anything other than the life her father has mapped out for his children is to be excommunicated! It’s siblings having to chose sides, it’s relying solely on oneself. Tara is one hell of a strong woman, and the madness of it is her parents, in all their outrageous expectations and teachings still are a part of the reason she turned out the way she did. What a thing to chew on! We become, either in spite of or because of, don’t we. We discard what’s been forced upon us, embrace it, or ulter it until the fit is right. Even the most horrific of things we have survived are a part of our evolution, so to speak.Tara loves her parents, there is no doubt but that doesn’t mean she can’t see their flaws. It’s a miracle anyone survived her father and his ideas, and her mother- because she allowed it, she took part in it. The dizzying moments come when things do turn out, when her parents have success or share a scrap of tenderness, that’s the confusion for her. Surely, if they are right about this than maybe she is the bad one?I can’t even begin to do justice to this memoir, it’s so hard to review them anyway as you feel like you have someone’s life in your hands, such an over-exaggeration I know, but really, this is a raw account of Tara Westover’s heartbreaking and inspiring struggle to free herself. Do not be fooled by the cover, it isn’t just about education nor off the grid survivalists and religion. I couldn’t put it down, and spent so much time collecting flies with my mouth gaping open in shock. There is a lingering sadness inside of me, even for her brother whom wronged Tara in so many ways, and that is how it is for her.I could write paragraphs about everything I felt and thought along the journey of this memoir, but the best I can do is tell others to read it! I hope there is another book one day, she is someone you long to check in on, that you’re rooting for. I don’t think I could have found my way as she found hers, it takes courage and something more that so many of us are missing. It’s so much easier to play possum and just accept the devil you know, but I kept hearing ‘pull yourself up by your bootstraps’ and ‘rely on yourself’. She sure did!Yes, a must read for 2018!Publication Date: February 20, 2018Random House"

First of all, I just want to say that I believe Tara Westover, 100%. Still, I couldn't help but do a bit of research on her family and their business, and it all just reinforced my belief in Tara's story. I guess from Tara's family's point of view, if you are abused like Tara was, you can just use an essential oil to treat it from her family's business for the low price of $16.67 (+ shipping).Honestly, I barely got through this audiobook, as compelling as it was. The neglect hurt me, but I think that Tara's story was inspiring and powerful, nevertheless. And though some of the medical details of the many accidents Tara's family suffered may have gotten distorted a bit through the lens of a young Tara, I have personally seen people suffer through black, decayed, pus-ridden ailments of the mouth (I'm a dentist), and NOT treat them. If you add in the fear of the medical profession and a lack of money, I can easily see how you could ignore even the more dire of illnesses.

It explored the extremes of religion, mental illness, abuse and familial relationships so well. It was so interesting, yet so heart-breaking. I was completely drawn in by how amazing the storytelling was and how equally engaging and informative I found it.It’s opened my eyes and made me think about several things, especially how isolation breeds ignorance. You see a lot of throughout whereby the author is so used to being in a tiny bubble that different perspectives don’t even come to mind. It’s almost unbelievable at times.This was as amazing as everyone I know has told me. Read it."

They tend to template: a young woman goes through a rough patch, then tries something impossibly challenging, which yields a self-discovery (often a realization that it was all her father's fault).And that template is here. I didn't trust all of it, surely, and found it incomplete. Yet, I also found it un-put-downable.It was the first week of Summer, and three days of glorious sunshine after seemingly months of rain. There was a lot of golf, some great meals and ample wine. The locals swept the Padres. My flowers are smiling. But I was happiest when I was reading this book."
199,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2095554-peachyto,Rating 5 out of 5,"**This review contains spoilers**'Emancipate yourselves from mental slaveryNone but ourselves can free our minds'- Bob Marley (as quoted in Educated)Welcome to one of the lengthiest book reviews I have ever written, as there was a lot to find here and many poignant quotes to share. What follows is a mix of summary, commentary, and admiration for the fierceness of a woman who was able to persevere in the face of endless adversity.After having spent the first 15 years of my life caught in the crosshairs of an unstable and abusive alcoholic father, without the assistance of any adults that would stand up to him, there was much I could relate to in Tara Westover’s struggle. Her story personally affected me much more than I had expected, and I was all in from beginning to end.Educated is a candid recounting of Tara’s sojourn to self-discovery. With an obvious gift for writing, hers is a memoir that reads like literary fiction, so at no point did I feel trapped in the depths of her despair. I was often taken away by her contemplative and affective prose instead of feeling laden with sadness, as can sometimes be the case with life stories.I have always supported homeschooling (done right), and had I the patience and resolve for such a task would have had my son learn at home as well. The Westover’s, however, were unaware of their limitations. What Tara and her siblings endured on that mountain was merely indoctrination that left them woefully unprepared for the real world. The minimal instruction their parents provided them was instead of an education, willful neglect, and dereliction of duty. With a parent often floundering in the recklessness of mania, the disregard the Westover children met with due to their bipolar father and silent mother frequently caused me to seethe. The persistent bodily harm the children were subject to was shameful. Whether when being coerced to work in the family junkyard or whilst enduring the near-fatal car wrecks they landed in when their father was in a depressive episode, their fate was always in his hands. The continual isolation from school and doctors meant no checks and balances from the authorities, and the children were left to fend for themselves. The hypocrisy in the home was rich and would be laughable if it were not so disastrous. They were strictly monitored concerning clothing choices, fraternising with members of the opposite sex, or being a part of a dance class, only to be left unprotected while dodging flying objects – or being set ablaze – in their junkyard.A lack of parental guidance may force a child to depend on instinct, instilling in them a sense of hypervigilance. What forms as a necessity for survival when younger can root into a fortress of fear and isolation later in life.‘Those instincts were my guardians. They had saved me before, guiding my movements on a dozen bucking horses, telling me when to cling to the saddle and when to pitch myself clear of pounding hooves. They were the same instincts that, years before, had prompted me to hoist myself from the scrap bin when Dad was dumping it, because they had understood, even if I had not, that it was better to fall from that great height rather than hope Dad would intervene. All my life those instincts had been instructing me in this single doctrine – that the odds are better if you rely on yourself.’Trauma can turn you to stone, may convince you that you are impervious to pain, that you could never fall victim again. And this, in and of itself, is the effect that renders you impenetrable. This imposed encasing of your emotions leaves you incapable of letting in the good while you incessantly battle against the bad.‘How I hollowed myself out…. I had misunderstood the vital truth: that it’s not affecting me, that was its effect.’Tara commenced her education by reading math textbooks in the balcony section of the local theatre, where she was allowed to sing. Finding a way to make sense of the world was a step towards enlightenment, while the logic and order found within trigonometry helped to eclipse the chaos she was living.‘I began to study trigonometry. There was solace in its strange formulas and equations. I was drawn to the Pythagorean theorem and its promise of a universal – the ability to predict the nature of any three points containing a right angle, anywhere, always. What I knew of physics I had learned in the junkyard, where the physical world often seemed unstable, capricious. But here was a principle through which the dimensions of life could be defined, captured. Perhaps reality was not wholly volatile. Perhaps it could be explained, predicted. Perhaps it could be made to make sense.’It can be impossible to break the chains of dysfunction that tie us to our abusers, as we instinctively push anyone who tries to love us away, unable to reconcile what love even is. When chaos is all that you know, how can you feel comfort or solace in the calm embrace of an outsider? When will they realise who you are, and from whence you came?‘If someone had asked me, I’d have said Charles was the most important thing in the world to me. But he wasn’t. And I would prove it to him. What was important to me wasn’t love or friendship, but my ability to lie convincingly to myself: to believe I was strong. I could never forgive Charles for knowing I wasn’t. I became erratic, demanding, hostile. I devised a bizarre and ever-evolving rubric by which I measured his love for me, and when he failed to meet it, I became paranoid. I surrendered to rages, venting all my savage anger, every fearful resentment I’d ever felt toward Dad or Shawn, at him, this bewildered bystander who’d only ever helped me.’Tara continued to struggle with her identity when making choices based on her newly acquired knowledge. Her personal growth and strength implanted with it a sense of sadness, as it served to further divide and alienate her from her family, pushing her nearer estrangement. Although finding her own way was a necessity, as well as a reflection of her inner fortitude, it left her with a void that a family of origin fills, be they toxic or safe, loving, or detrimental.‘ The truth is: that I am not a good daughter. I am a traitor, a wolf among sheep; there is something different about me and that difference is not good…I am not sorry, merely ashamed.’The mistreatment Tara suffered was never exclusive to her father, her relationship with her brother Shawn mimicking that of a battered wife trying to survive her tyrannical husband. After countless beatings that kept her mired in shame, she blamed herself, as a traumatised brain is wont to do. It seemed that over the years, she coped by vacillating between fear and fondness for what she told herself was a special relationship they shared.‘I begin to reason with myself, to doubt whether I had spoke clearly: what had I whispered and what had I screamed? I decided that if I had asked differently, been more calm, he would have stopped. I write this [in her journal] until I believe it, which doesn’t take long because I want to believe it. It’s comforting to think the defect is mine, because that means it is under my power.’Not until Tara had heard accounts of Shawn’s abuse towards other women – even needing further admission from the men in their lives – did she trust her thoughts or the words in her journal.We can speak endlessly about the damage inflicted by her father and brother, but I feel her mother needs to take a fair share of the blame, as well. Not only did Tara’s mother not protect her, in many ways, she ‘parentified’ her. Like when trying to guilt her into caring for her abusive brother; that which her mother certainly had not prioritised the time to do herself, given how he turned out. This ‘mother’ was often more concerned about covering up the image and fragility of her son, to the detriment of her daughter, and was quick to cut her off if she did not comply with the instructed narrative.The exemption that Tara’s parents afforded their son at her expense saw her struggle with self-reliance and self-worth. I assume their allegiance to him is due to him being male, but it may also be for them to stay firm in their denial of how he turned out. She found solace in her studies, as she took the ACT admissions test (twice) and stumbled through Brigham Young University. Accustomed to isolation, Tara suffered from social awkwardness and untold ignorance regarding societal issues and events in history. But, she stayed the course, and through ability and dedication, found herself with an opportunity to take her education to England.In what seems like poetry, Tara went on to study historians at Cambridge. By escaping the dark shadow of misinformation cast by her father’s teachings, she was enlightened and able to study experts in the details of the past. ‘From my father I learned that books were to be either adored or exiled. Books that were of God – books written by the Mormon prophets or the Founding Fathers – were not to be studied so much as cherished, like a thing perfect in itself. I had been taught to read the words of Madison as a cast into which I ought to pour the plaster of my own mind, to be reshaped according to the contours of their faultless model. I read them to learn what to think, not how to think for myself. Books that were not of God were banished; they were a danger, powerful and irresistible in their cunning.’In the eyes of her father, all of her hard work and fearless determination still were not her own. He dared to take credit for her successes, declaring that it was on behalf of her homeschooling that she achieved such honours. He believed she should publicly relay more gratitude to her parents for this.No matter how far she travelled, she forever felt tethered to her family and her responsibility to her roots. Often there were opportunities for the Westover’s to drag Tara back into the family fold of delusion and deceit. Being asked to forsake all that she had amassed, to fall right back into that which marred her start, was not only selfish on the parts of her parents but impossible for such a devoted and transformed person to allow. To do so would have been a sure contradiction to the mountainous acts of bravery, grit, and dedication that she channeled to become the person she now knew herself to be. ‘Everything I had worked for, all my years of study, had been to purchase for myself this one privilege: to see and experience more truths than those given to me by my father, and to use those truths to construct my own mind…. If I yielded now, I would lose more than an argument. I would lose custody of my own mind. This was the price I was being asked to pay, I understood that now. What my father wanted to cast from me wasn’t a demon: it was me.’  The rejection she received because of her integrity almost caused her to fail her Ph.D. at Harvard. She became consumed with depression and loss as she bore witness to the tug-of-war between where she was going and where her family needed her to be.‘The thing about having a mental breakdown is that no matter how obvious it is that you’re having one, it is somehow not obvious to you. I’m fine, you think. So what if I watched TV for twenty-four straight hours yesterday. I’m not falling apart. I’m just lazy. Why it’s better to think yourself lazy than think yourself in distress, I’m not sure. But it was better. More than better: it was vital.’The entirety of her family’s love, save that from her brother Tyler and his wife, was conditional. An offer of reacceptance into the cult of Westover was eventually put forth, via ultimatum, that would see Tara throw herself on the altar of their perceived righteousness, seemingly as a sacrificial gesture of humility. In the end, the fool’s paradise that her family expected her to reside in was too ridiculous for her emotional education to allow. She could exist with the guilt that she continued to allow them to assign her, or she could move on and live a life grounded in truth, taking pride in herself and her hard-won achievements.‘But vindication has no power over guilt. No amount of anger or rage directed at others can subdue it, because guilt is never about them. Guilt is the fear of one’s own wretchedness. It has nothing to do with other people.’Ultimately, I think the unresolved conflict that she waged within herself was rooted in her need to accept the different parts of who she was without shame or guilt. She had to reconcile that the girl that hailed from that dangerous mountain, living in the shadow of its demons, was also a part of the woman she now was. The convergence of these two personas would allow her to move forward in good faith and good health. Sadly – or graciously – this would have to be without the stranglehold of her family.When perusing Goodreads, I saw that Tara’s mother had written a retaliatory book to her daughter’s claims laid out in Educated. From what I observed in various reviews, it was nothing more than an attempt to gaslight and invalidate Tara’s experience of her childhood. She vehemently denied that Tara and her siblings were insufficiently educated or raised. In fact, she spent a lot of time defending her husband and his deranged behaviour. In my view, their book provides proof that Tara continues to be the recipient of bad parenting. The Westover’s had no interest in protecting their children when they allowed unmitigated mental health issues to fester, and it was their (ignorant and paranoid) way or bust. She could not have proven Tara’s case any better than with the writing of their tone-deaf book.Educated has made me a fan of Tara and her writing. I patiently await any lead she has left in her pencil. I found myself thinking about Landslide by Fleetwood Mac a lot when reading this book, and even took a break to listen to it; it feels like a song that just fits the story.To visit the peachybooks.ca post for this review and see the crocheted bookmark I was inspired to make click

200,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49089020-sharon-metcalf,Rating 5 out of 5,"The very first words I read by Tara Westover were the words in her Author Note at the beginning of her memoir Educated.    ""This story is not about Mormonism. Neither is it about any other form of religious belief. In it there are many types of people, some believers, some not; some kind, some not. The author disputes any correlation, positive or negative, between the two.""They were important words (as were all the words that followed).   As her story unfolded it would have been so easy to forget her advice and draw precisely the conclusion she was warning against.     Tara Westover was raised in an unorthodox family on an isolated farm at Buck Peak Idaho.    That her parents loved her was never in doubt yet at times I wanted to scream at them.  The dangerous situations they not only allowed but seemed to invite upon Tara and her siblings were to my mind criminal.   Her father in particular was a fervent devotee of the Mormon faith and this comment, typifies his attitude “Don’t worry, honey,” he said. “God is here, working right alongside us. He won’t let anything hurt you. But if you are hurt, then that is His will.”   Her mother was a  self confessed pleaser   ""...she said she couldn’t stop herself from speculating what people wanted her to be, and from contorting herself, compulsively, unwillingly, into whatever it was."" Over the years this did not work in Tara's favour when she needed a mother to stand firm in support of her against the bullying and violence of her aggressive brother.   Tara's story was one of self discovery.     Having no formal education until she was 17 she had been heavily influenced by her parents beliefs which she accepted unreservedly.     When finally she began studying she discovered that not only did she have an aptitude for it but she also began questioning the way her life had been defined for her by others.   Whilst she excelled in her studies,  over the years her knowledge and broadened horizons created a chasm between her and her family and a battle of will ensued which she described this way.   "" Everything I had worked for, all my years of study, had been to purchase for myself this one privilege: to see and experience more truths than those given to me by my father, and to use those truths to construct my own mind. I had come to believe that the ability to evaluate many ideas, many histories, many points of view, was at the heart of what it means to self-create.""    At times the book was difficult to read but not for  one millisecond did I consider stopping.  That she survived her childhood, overcame multiple obstacles and gained an impressive Cambridge and Harvard education is no small matter.    That she wrote an exceptional book is very much our gain.      If you appreciate beautiful, eloquent writing,  a fascinating story, and feel ready to experience a vast array of emotions I strongly encourage you to read Educated.Many thanks to the author who did a magnificent job of telling her story, to Random House the publishers and NetGalley for the opportunity of reading this digital ARC in exchange for an honest review which it was my absolute pleasure to provide."

“… we had been sculpted by a tradition given to us by others, a tradition of which we were either willfully or accidentally ignorant.”
One of the most engrossing books I’ve ever read, Educated is the memoir of a woman raised in the mountains of Idaho with her siblings as a survivalist family. Her parents, deeply fundamentalist, don’t believe in doctors or modern medicine, outside schooling, or anything hinting at government intervention or control. They stockpile weapons and food for the time they may be forced to defend their way of life.
“When life itself seems lunatic, who knows where madness lies” - (Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra)
Never even having a birth certificate until she was nine years old – in fact never really knowing exactly when her birthday is – Tara Westover grew up working in her father’s scrapyard and helping her midwife mother gather and combine herbs for homeopathic treatments. She and her siblings were raised in fear and disdain of things “ungodly” or “whorish.” Members of the family suffer several traumatic injuries over the years, almost always forced to heal “naturally” at home, but the most traumatic of all may be the damage that they suffered to their own self-esteem, their own subverted will, and their own ability to think for themselves. Tara’s memories and understanding of events were constantly disputed and challenged, including the facts of one brother’s repeatedly dangerous abuse to her and other family members. 
“Guilt is the fear of one’s own wretchedness. It has nothing to do with other people.”
Tara, although having suffered years of self-doubt and manipulation by her mentally ill father, her weak mother and abusive brother, and with virtually no education at all, manages to find herself at Brigham Young University, and from there she continues on to a Master’s degree and PHD from Cambridge before she is thirty years old. Although these achievements speak volumes about her inner strength, she still must deal with her own guilt for breaking from her family’s traditions and beliefs, and for saving herself. 
“I am not the child my father raised, but he is the father who raised her”
This book was so well-written and absorbing that I couldn’t put it down. The horrors of her growing up years and she agony and self-questioning she still faced even after “escaping,” tore at my heart. She finally learns that her family wouldn’t change, even though she had. A wonderful book that I believe deserves many more than simply 5 stars. Many thanks to NetGalley for a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review."

Unfortunately not all of them were positive.I wrote a review right after finishing this audiobook and all of my feelings came bursting out like a torrent. Reading it the next day I knew I couldn't let it stand like this. It was a mess of thoughts, emotional outbursts and aggravation.It was not easy for me to listen to this audiobook.EDUCATED depicts an American lifestyle that I can't fathom still exists in this century. A life that was so vividly different, extreme and in parts unbelievable that it was hard for me to imagine. Because of this the story was highly compelling. Even enthralling. But also a source of frustration and anger.The author grew up as the seventh child of a Mormon survivalist family, on a remote mountain in Idaho. Her father's mental illness, and her mother's support for such a man and his nonsensical ideas and demands, plus the isolation that the mountain offered, made this book a very complex and emotional read.I became exasperated with the author's inability to distance herself from such a volatile and unhealthy relationship with her family. Especially after she left for college and university. The hold that her family had on her was unfathomable to me. But I didn't live the way she lived. I didn't experience the isolation and her father's doctrines. Her life was unique, unorthodox, and incredibly different. And all because of one man.One of the things that I'll take away from this book is the proof of how much a person can achieve by just putting their mind to it. The author's accomplishments are incredible. And because of that her story is one I will never forget.But I do feel like I need counseling after listening to this book - lol.___________________________________Find more reviews and book recommendations on my blogFollow me on Bookstagram"

Prior to that she never attended school: college would be her first experience with formal education. Not only was going to college a way to get an education, but it also served as an escape from an turbulent family life.Westover would grapple with being away at school and not being an obedient daughter; she felt the constant pull towards home and sought its acceptance. Even during very unhealthy times she still could not release her home life’s hold on her: to which she couldn’t fully emerge herself in to her new surroundings. It would be a long journey until Westover would embrace her own understandings of the world around her and not the ones her family decided for her.To read my full review: https://saturdaynitereader.com/2018/0...I truly hope Tara’s story is heard around the world and that she achieves critical acclaim.

205,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3965659-rachel,Rating 3 out of 5,"Well, Tara Westover is certainly a remarkable woman with a remarkable story. It's not difficult to see why Educated has been so well received, and if you're interested in reading it I'd implore you to take my 3 stars with a grain of salt, as I mainly think I just wasn't the right reader for this book.Educated is Westover's memoir of growing up in a survivalist family in the mountains of Idaho. Though she was technically supposed to have been home-schooled, her lessons stopped when she was fairly young, and her sporadic self-teaching hardly was able to prepare her for setting foot in a classroom for the first time when she was accepted to BYU at 17. But we know from the blurb that she ends up getting a PhD from Cambridge, so from the beginning it's clear that Westover's memoir is in many ways going to be a success story. But it isn't a smooth journey, owing to the ongoing abuse that she suffered at the hands of her father and older brother, well into adulthood.The first half of this book chronicles Westover's childhood, and to me this was undoubtedly the weaker half of the story. The anecdotes selected, though extreme and shocking and therefore compelling in a morbid way, I think rely a bit too heavily on their shock value to engage the reader. I felt this fell into that trap of too much recall/not enough analysis. Though Westover expertly evoked the setting of her childhood with details like her father's rejection of hospitals and the sense of impending doom with which he navigated their survivalist life, the scene was set early on, and the sheer number of car crashes and burns and other accidents recounted actually served to bog down the narrative for me.The second half, which details Westover's experience with her education, improved the memoir in leaps and bounds. At this point in the story the self-reflection kicks into a higher gear, as Westover begins to reconcile her parents' view of the world with her own experiences. This particular kind of resilience I guess resonated with me more than the kind of strength it took Westover to survive her childhood - I'm not diminishing that in any way, just to clarify, but I can't deny that I found the second half of this memoir twice as stimulating as the first. I've been browsing some of the negative reviews for this book, and noticing that there's a common thread of not believing Westover's account of things. And I admittedly get that. I would describe myself as a rather gullible person, but even I started questioning certain details in her story - more having to do with the smooth trajectory of her education than with her childhood abuse. I actually found the eccentric and violent survivalist family much more believable than the fact that someone who didn't have a birth certificate for nearly a decade, who doesn't even know her own birthday, was able to seamlessly enroll in college and obtain a passport. But despite my conflicting feelings about this, I think when you choose to read a memoir, you're doing so with the knowledge that you only have the author's truth. Occasionally you'll hear stories about memoirs and nonfiction books being debunked, but for the most part, you're never going to find out the objective truth behind the story you just read. So rather than torture myself over this, I'm choosing to believe Tara Westover, and believe that perseverance and passion is sometimes all it takes to turn your life around, difficult as the challenges may be. If you're interested in that kind of story, Educated is definitely the memoir for you."
206,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5837456-susan,Rating 5 out of 5,"The author of this memoir grew up in a rural area in Idaho. Her parents were strict Mormon’s and her father was paranoid, volatile and spent his time either working in his scrap yard or preparing for the end of the world. With gender roles strictly enforced (unless, as we later discover, it suits Tara’s father that she step out of the kitchen and help him in some extremely physical, and dangerous, labour), her mother is submissive and prefers to ignore what she does not want to see. Pushed by her husband into helping as a midwife on the mountain community, with every act her father wills as ‘divine,’ and so not easily rejected, she eventually embraces healing. In a way, it is useful that Tara’s mother does become a healer, as the family do not believe in traditional medicine. Or education, which is, of course, central to this book. Tara is one of seven siblings – five boys and two girls. To her, it almost seems as though there are two families within her own. The three oldest boys received a rudimentary education, before being pulled out of school and either quarrelling, or working for, their father. The four younger children never set foot in a classroom and, while their mother insists they are being home schooled, her father only really insists that she learn Morse Code. The issues with medicine also have terrible ramifications – while it may be acceptable to take a herbal remedy for a cold, or headache, the mix of a junkyard, complete with machinery, plus the fact their father seems to want to drive everyone cross country, at night, with no seatbelts, leads to some really traumatic scenes. This book is not for the faint hearted.At some point, Tara decides she wishes to go to school. Along the way, she suffers various setbacks. She has no understanding of basic subjects, such as maths or history. Her parents feel betrayed by her decision and she lacks the funds that she needs to help her study. While she does go away to college and, eventually, to both Cambridge and Harvard, she continually feels a pull back to Bucks Peak and her family. However, as well as her difficult relationship with her father, there is the ominous presence of her older brother, Sean. Sean is demanding, difficult, aggressive, controlling and violent. As she grows, Tara questions her role in her family, her beliefs and her past. Is educating herself worth it, if she loses her ties to her childhood, home and family? What, in fact, will her education cost her?This is a very moving and well written memoir and I applaud the author for her bravery in writing it. As someone who has spent most of their life reading, the thought of Tara’s rebellion against her enforced ignorance is extremely impressive. Her story is liberating, empowering, impressive and inspiring. She fought against the life that had been written for her and she changed her story. Tara had no idea about literature, but she was forging her own path and re-writing her future. I am deeply humbled by this book, which is one I recommend highly. I received a copy of this book from the publisher, via NetGalley, for review. "

I think I'm somewhere in the middle. There's the curiosity of how a whole family survives as many accidents and injuries without much medical intervention. Mental illness definitely plays a part in some of her Dad's thoughts. The role of the Mormon Church is definitely evident here as well.I applaud Tara Westover for eventually getting out of her toxic family environment to educate herself. I found the abuse she described as appalling and it horrified me that her other family members would turn against her when she wanted the truth to come out.Tara's life in a survivalist family in Idaho made for interesting reading, but I was left feeling unfulfilled at the end. I wanted redemption and reconciliation for her, but maybe that comes from so many books having that happy ever after ending.I will have a chance to hear the author speak at the end of the month and I'm looking forward to hearing what she has to say about this book and her life.

208,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,Rating 3 out of 5,"Wow, I was not prepared for this. It’s been from A Little Life of Yanagihara that I felt so uncomfortable during reading a book: the incessant series of incidents of physical and psychological terror the protagonist had to endure gripped me by the throat, and even increasingly because I quite quickly realized that this was not fiction, but an autobiographical work. Tara Westover describes her childhood in what initially seems an ordinary coming-of-age story of a girl who grows up in rural Idaho in a large family, with a father that is a metal scrapper and an uneducated midwife as a mother. The parents are Mormons, but they clearly stand outside of the mainstream of that Church. Alarm bells start to go off as father begins to show fanatic `survivalist’ traits, rebels against the government, refuses to register his children or send them to school, and prepares his family for the Apocalypse, including collecting an arsenal of weapons and large supplies of food and fuel. That may still be quite normal by American Midwest standards, but what Westover describes cannot be called anything other than psychological indoctrination and physical terror against the children. That starts with the dangerous work they have to do in the metal scrapping and the brutal accidents they have while doing this, the prohibition of accepting medical assistance when the children are seriously or even perilously injured, the constant stream of curses and threats when they demand to receive proper education, and finally, the repeated physical torture she has to undergo by one of the crazed older brother. In the second half of the book Westover contrasts this with her personal emancipation, her struggle for proper education, departing from inadequate self-study to the sudden leap to university education and eventually a Phd. Most interestingly, this is accompanied by a constant distance and again reconnection with her family, and the undermining self-doubt that is typical of people who had to endure such a traumatic parenting situation. It is striking how detached Westover describes all of this, stripped of cheap pathos and even without too much rancor. That clearly sets her apart from other testimonials in this genre, and it makes her strength too. Nor is she shying away of the question of truth: she repeatedly admits that what she describes is hér perspective, and that it may be one-sided or distorted. This also manifests itself in a sometimes-messy storyline, with passages that seem to rattle a bit (and that give skeptics the chance to undermine her stories) and with somewhat too drawn out attempts to justify herself. In my opinion, those weaknesses actually give her story a greater authenticity. That does not mean that I am not left with a few uncomfortable feelings. For example, in her writing Westover regularly approaches the edge of what derogatorily is called ""painporn"", especially in the detailed descriptions of the psychological terror and the physical injuries (such as with her brother Luke who burns his leg). I also had a hard time finding the jump from no education at all to a brilliant academic career plausible; could it be that there was some literary exaggeration involved here? Westover also avoids confrontation with the Mormon faith: I agree, the paranoia or the bipolar disorder of the father are not directly related to this, but his religious insanity is at least the breeding ground for his extreme behavior. It seems to me that Westover on this one has capitulated for the line that you cannot cross without impunity in the US.These are remarks that ultimately reduce this book to what it is: an extraordinary personal document, a remarkable testimonial of therapeutical writing off traumatic events and struggles by constructing a coherent story, by a person that has miraculously overcome her dire condition. Mind you, I am not at all saying that this book is untrue, on the contrary. But it is the truth of Tara Westover, and I want to have all due respect for that. In any case, it has not left me unaffected."

“The decisions I made after that moment were not the ones she would have made. They were the choices of a changed person, a new self. You could call this selfhood many things. Transformation. Metamorphosis. Falsity. Betrayal. I call it an education.”
Review:Educated is a very fascinating and compelling story of a girl who grows up in a secluded world with a certain set of beliefs. Education enables her to learn more about the outside world and gain a different perspective. The book highlights the importance of education in empowering people to be rational and intellectually aware.I enjoyed the writing style of the author. The description of the mountains, the unusual stories of her family was riveting. This is the first time I read about people who break away from the mainstream. I can’t imagine life without electricity, phone and other everyday things. I never knew some people intentionally choose to live that way. This book had me hooked right from the start and kept me invested in her world.The author mentioned in her interviews that she could recall the past with such clarity because she has been writing journals ever since she was young. She describes her struggle with accepting new beliefs and learning a different way of life. I felt like I could connect to her story. The book is mostly about how education changed Tara’s world because of which she could not reconcile her new lifestyle with her parents’ extremist one.Although this book describes the unconventional way of living, I felt it is more about living with a person with mental illness. It affects not only the sick but also the loved ones around them. Tara also talks a lot about the silent abuse she encountered in the family while growing up.In Tara’s interviews, she states that one reason for writing this book was to tell the side of the story that her parents forced her to hide. I read that her parents hired a lawyer who claimed that the book falsely portrays the Westover family. I feel like her story is complex and different people experience the same things differently. But as far as the writing goes, I believe her.Criticism:What I’m about to say is not meant to discredit or disregard the author’s experiences. She is a smart and hardworking woman who went through a lot of struggles and created a new life for herself. But, there were some things I just couldn’t wrap my mind around.First, Tara’s family encountered two accidents but survived them. It is difficult for me to reconcile this with the fact that her family never visited the hospital. I think Tara unknowingly exaggerated the enormity of the accidents. Next, most of the time she talks about an incident without giving a proper explanation. I wished she had maintained continuity throughout the book as the narrative gets broken off so abruptly.Overall, this is a beautifully written, thought-provoking and inspiring memoir. Last year, Bill Gates had this book on his recommended list. That’s one more reason to give this book a read."

It had never occurred to me that my voice might be as strong as theirs.”  Educated is the memoir of Tara Westover, a woman who grew up among a survivalist Mormon family in the countryside and who didn’t attend school until she was seventeen years old. Tara did not grow up the way most families do, her family did go to doctors or hospitals (no matter what) and were completely isolated from modern society. Once Tara leaves the only world she has ever known, she begins to form her own opinions and becomes at odds with her family.  “It’s strange how you give the people you love so much power over you.”  I’m having a very hard time gathering my thoughts on this book. First and foremost, I am a bit skeptical of some of the events mostly because of the author’s own admission that she does not remember everything that happened correctly, that others who had been there had different perspectives. But I also think with the amount of trauma this woman went through, that affects the brain and how one remembers things. Plus her major in college was historiography, which is the study of writing history. I’m not saying Westover is lying, but much of what is written in this book (mostly the multiple car accidents and injuries) doesn’t seem likely to me.I think what is most important about this book is the discussion it creates. I have talked about this book with my coworkers at length, looked up videos of interviews with the author. There are a lot of topics in this book that you can choose to discuss from religion, mental illness, abuse, school, love, family, social norms and more. It’s hard to choose just one aspect of the book to discuss. For me, the most interesting parts of the books were when Westover started college and was introduced to this completely new environment, and how she adapted to it.While I found the book compelling, I only liked it I did not love it. Hence, my three stars. I have MANY different thoughts and feelings about this book but they are difficult to put into words. I can see how many readers loved this book, why many readers hated it. Both are very valid opinions and feelings. I do think, it’s an important book to read in general and for readers to come to their own conclusions.  “You can love someone and still choose to say goodbye to them,” she says now. “You can miss a person every day, and still be glad that they are no longer in your life.”  Follow me on ♥ Facebook ♥ Blog ♥ Instagram ♥ Twitter ♥"

Nu regret alegerea făcută și sunt convinsă că nu o voi uita prea curând!Nu este o carte ușor de citit. După unele episoade am simțit nevoia să îmi reamintesc că Tara există, astfel că am urmărit tot felul de materiale care o conțin și care certificau faptul că toată drama expusă de omul acesta este reală. Și nu e doar o poveste singulară, e povestea multora, e drama unor suflete care nu au avut norocul de a se naște într-o familie care să le asigure dragoste, susținere și..normalitate. Căci da, educația ar trebui să se confunde cu normalitatea.Sunt mulți ca Tara după cum spuneam, dar sunt puțini cei care aleg să își depășească condiția, frustrările, neputințele și nefericirile-pe care culmea-le-au primit chiar de la familie. Se pierd în neant căutându-și scuze ori arâtând cu degetul către familia care nu a fost de fapt familie, ci blestem. Dar poate e vorba despre cât de mult poate duce un om, despre cât de puternic ești, despre cât de sincer ești cu tine și despre perspective. Cu toții privim același ”cer”, perspectivele ne diferențiază, poate. Ca să înțelegem acest aspect avem nevoie de îngăduință-față de noi și față de familie, prieteni, oameni, în general-de EDUCAȚIE și de dorința de a înțelege. A găsi vinovați și a trăi plini de resentimente e ușor, dar a te autodepăși și a ierta este o provocare și se confundă cu succesul și cu atributele unui om bun din toate punctele de vedere.„Scopul întregii mele munci, al tuturor anilor de studiu fusese să obțin pentru mine acest privilegiu: să văd și să trăiesc mai multe adevăruri decât cele primite de la tătăl meu și să mă folosesc de aceste adevăruri pentru a-mi construi propria gândire. Ajunsesem la convingerea că posibilitatea de a cântări mai multe idei, multe istorii, multe puncte de vedere era miezul a ceea ce înseamnă să te creezi singur. Dacă cedam acum, nu pierdeam doar o dispută. Pierdeam stăpânirea asupra propriei minți. Acesta era prețul pe care mi se cerea să-l plătesc, acum înțelegeam.

What a life.Maybe saying this makes me a bad person but when I was little I've always thought that American people who live in certain States are like this, like the author’s family, but it was just a thought, I’ve never imagined it could actually happen. I mean, they're a lot of wrong things in America, but schools are not one of them.My mind struggles to realize how can someone not know about Martin Luther King or the Holocaust, it’s just impossible to me. Besides this, it’s the lack of education to blows it. You can be not able to do maths or know the geography of the world, but five people out of nine in that family can’t speak for themselves, elaborate their own thoughts, be themselves as individuals. And you can’t even be angry because you're not angry with them, but with their ignorance.So Tara had three monsters in her life: ignorance, religious fanaticism, and her older brother Shawn. I can’t choose which is the worst.I might be one of those people who always blame religion but, in this case, I just blame her mother. She didn’t even raise her children, she just agreed with her husband and then forgot about them, about the fact that kids need to know how to read and do simple fractions or know which is the capital of their own County. I'm not gonna be easy on this, she was a terrible mother for every single one of them.But, more in general, it’s just made me sad.I'm so happy for her, for everything she’s done and the life she has now, but she’ll always try to reconnect with her family. Even if they’re strangers. She’ll always try to have an answer from her mother, and it’s going to get worse because one day she’ll have her own family with a husband and maybe a couple of kids, and she won’t be able to talk about her family because she hasn’t one.With everything she’s been through, I sincerely hope her to be happy and, more important, free.↠ 4 stars"

É uma sequência e uma ordem natural das coisas que aos 6 anos vamos para a escola. Para nós, muitas vezes a escola é vista não como um direito, mas como uma obrigação, algo que nos é imposto e que, de certa forma, às vezes nem compreendemos o ""porquê"" ou o ""para quê"". Mas se isso não nos fosse facultado, se não tivessemos essa facilidade e esse direito que nos é oferecido, quão diferente seria o mundo?A autora lutou pela própria educação. Lutou contra a família por esse direito, mas, acima de tudo, lutou contra si própria e tudo o que tomava como certo. E esse percurso não foi fácil, aliás, parece-me que, mesmo agora, não será fácil e estará pejado de dúvidas.Acredito que para se gostar deste livro, para se levar as coisas que nos são contadas como algo verídico e não saído de ficção (porque parece, muito), é preciso uma de duas coisas: ter-se crescido num meio castrador, onde a cultura familiar e religiosa muitas vezes se impõem para lá do que sabemos ser real, ou ser-se uma pessoa muito empática e compreender que a natureza humana e a psicologia, muitas vezes parece mais ficcionada que a ficção.É um livro simplesmente assombroso, com uma escrita muito fluída e literária, tendo em conta o facto de ser uma biografia.

This is a case of the latter.I mean, education has always been very important to me. So much so that I've read nearly 6k books for the freaking hell of it. So when faced with an autobiography of someone who had never been to school until she was 17 and eventually made it all the way through Cambridge, I had to sit my ass down and read her story.I mean, let's face it: most people who are stuck that deep in a poverty hole, forced to live in ignorance flavored by religious fanaticism clothed in survivalism and home-schooling, do NOT, generally, ever get out of these holes. It's not just the lack of resources, it's the lack of support from within. So we get a story, here, of as much luck as strong will. That being said, it IS a feel-good story but I also felt the despair that didn't so much hide beneath the words but sit on my chest and choke me around my neck. There's something evil about any kind of acceptance of long-term abuse. But the joy of having one's eyes opened to a wider world, of making new decisions because you can, was always tempered by the unenviable return to despair when one is forced to choose between family and a loss of ignorance. I thoroughly enjoyed the account and empathized with it. It's also a glowing endorsement of the old observation that schools breed liberals. When education itself is radical and disruptive, then perhaps ignorance is the ultimate reactionary state. Any way of living that cannot withstand close scrutiny and comparison with anything else may not have the most sound foundation."

Also, there are people who testify her stories, and the publisher did fact-check the whole book (I reckon that is a necessary step in publishing to avoid getting sued). What I mean is I just cannot imagine that such a family still exists in the 21st century, right in America. And her journey from that chaotic childhood, through domestic violence, abuse, false beliefs, and no formal education all the way to Cambridge and Harvard is just extraordinary. Tara's writing is so good. The book is fascinating, it's a real page-turner and I found it hard to put it down.

E indipendenza. E libertà.Ma il caso di Tara Westover, classe 1986, è diverso ancora, e per certi versi maggiormente emblematico e sconcertante, perché Tara oggi scrittrice di questo romanzo di autofiction e docente di Storia a Cambridge, è cresciuta nella parte rurale dello stato dell’Idaho, a Buck Peak, insieme a sei fratelli (sono due femmine e cinque maschi) in seno a una famiglia che appartiene al mormonesimo più rigido e intransigente che si possa immaginare. Sempre che noi, oggi, si possa immaginare qualcosa, perché al di là delle poche conoscenze che riguardano i Testimoni di Geova presenti anche da noi (e la recente lettura di La ballata di Adam Henry di Ian McEwan ha aggiunto un prezioso punto di vista), e delle comunità Amish raccontate nei film, di comunità mormone che vivono apparentemente integrate nella società americana (sono una vera e propria chiesa, che non si faccia l’errore di confonderle con una piccola setta religiosa) - laddove, come in questo caso, non vi sia una deriva che sconfina nel fanatismo - credo che la maggior parte di noi ne sappia pochissimo. The Weaver family was described as Idaho “freedom fighters”.Photo from Tara Westover’s book educatedLa sua è una famiglia apparentemente normale, mimetizzata dalle poche possibilità economiche in un contesto sociale semplice, e dove la maggior parte dei concittadini sono anche loro mormoni; il padre e i fratelli, ma anche lei, quando i fratelli maggiori lasceranno la casa di famiglia, lavorano in una discarica casalinga piena di pericoli, fra i rottami delle automobili, mentre la madre, che inizialmente si occupava di preparare unguenti e misture di erbe a scopo curativo per la levatrice del luogo (quando già partorire in casa è proibito dalla legge), nel corso degli anni diventerà lei stessa levatrice e nel contempo, spinta dal marito - ostile a tutto ciò che proviene dallo Stato, e quindi anche dai medici, colpevole ai suoi occhi di volerli uccidere - e per sostituirsi in tutto e per tutto alla medicina allopatica, naturopata. Quella di Tara Westover e della sua famiglia è una storia di follia, dove le manie di persecuzione del capofamiglia, probabilmente affetto da disturbo bipolare (non sono io a dirlo, è una delle ipotesi cui giunge la stessa l’autrice nel corso degli anni di studio), le violenze fisiche e psichiche da parte di uno dei fratelli (a indicare che forse alcune tare sono di natura genetica e che forse questo fratello era affetto da schizofrenia), la chiusura a tutto ciò che proviene dall’esterno e dalla società civile - la scuola, dove nessuno dei fratelli, tranne i più grandi nei primi anni della loro esistenza, sono mai andati, i documenti, che non hanno mai avuto, l’informazione, cui non hanno accesso - d’altra parte l’istruzione è qualcosa che nella loro vita viene a mancare molto presto, essendo incaricata la madre, non troppo istruita di loro, di occuparsene - si misurano con le manie persecutorie, in crescendo, del padre, che è convinto di dover proteggere la propria famiglia dall’arrivo dei Giorni del’Abominio, che distruggeranno il mondo, accumulando cibi, armi e costruendo un gigantesco rifugio nascosto nella collina, e da chi, sempre lo Stato, cercherà di ucciderli.Sembrerebbe quasi un racconto distopico con tendenze apocalittiche, se non fosse che il racconto di Tara Westover attinge dalla sua giovane memoria familiare (l’autrice inserisce nei momenti cruciali e più drammatici del suo racconto delle note con cui informa il lettore dei dubbi riguardo all’esattezza degli stessi, delle diverse versioni date dai fratelli con i quali si è confrontata), se non fosse che l’autrice, oggi appena trentaduenne, ha portato sulla pelle e dentro di sé i segni delle violenze subite.Se non fosse che lentamente, Tara Westover, inizia ad avere coscienza di sé e del fatto che potrebbe essere qualcosa di diverso da quello che i genitori hanno pensato per lei, che vede la sua strada già tracciata oltre che dalla madre anche dalla sorella maggiore. Se non fosse che lentamente inizia ad aprirsi con curiosità al mondo esterno: al canto. Al ballo. Allo studio inteso come strumento di conoscenza, prima ancora che di istruzione - Tara, per esempio, quando ha accesso al primo programma di istruzione, ignora cosa sia successo l’11 settembre del 2001 e cosa sia l’Olocausto - alla conoscenza come lasciapassare per l’autonomia, autonomia che serve per liberarsi dalla sudditanza psicologica che la paralizza ogniqualvolta prova a liberarsi dal giogo impostole dal padre e dal fratello, ma anche dalla passività della madre.Bello di una bellezza dolorosa, perché se è vero che c’è riscatto, e basta guardare le foto di Tara Westover oggi e leggere della strada che ha fatto come studiosa e accademica, dall’altro non si può non inorridire di fronte a tanta miseria umana e ignoranza e rabbrividire pensando a quanto orrore provocano la cieca abnegazione e osservanza di precetti falsamente attribuiti alla religione, e non si può non pensare a quanto lungo e doloroso sia stato il suo percorso per riuscire ad arrivare a essere la donna che è diventata oggi.Non bello da un punto di vista stilistico, piuttosto normale, direi, ma non un libro del quale si potrebbe parlare per giorni e giorni per il suo contenuto e le tematiche che solleva. (A questo proposito, un articolo interessante su Il Libraio che accenna alla possibile non totale veridicità di quanto narrato dall’autrice - parte della famiglia ha sconfessato la versione di Tara - e all’attuale posizione delle case editrici che prendono le distanze da questo genere di opere - come non pensare al citato James Frey di Un milione di piccoli pezzi o a J.T. Leroy di Ingannevole in cuore più di ogni cosa?

It’s really brought us together this week💞Harsh review up ahead. Mild spoilers. This family is absolutely vulgar in nearly every way imaginable. Tara writes about growing up in a house full of what the author describes to be nazi pedophiles and talks about her experience of rampant abuse that often turned sexual in nature. Once Tara leaves to attend BYU, she seems to live two different lives. One of obedience in every way to her human stain of a family, and one of mild freedom and fundi-lite learning where nearly every door is opened for her financially and education-wise. She often attributes this to God (whether sarcastically, truthfully, or as a commentary on her upbringing, it doesn’t really matter), magic, or her finally overcoming her pride and accepting (the wildly privileged amount of) help.Believe me or not, I found it easy to empathize with young Tara and was absolutely flabbergasted by author Tara. The way she was writing was as if she was merely a spectator to the circus that was her life. Only taking accountability for laughably innocent things. When Tara goes to Cambridge and is partnered with a professor who specializes in education to do with the Holocaust, Tara comes to the conclusion that her dad could actually be wrong in his recollection of history (holocaust and slavery denier), yet so could the “gate-keeping historians.” She’s also so incredibly rude and judgmental to every woman around her. And only women. I understand that this most likely has a lot to do with her upbringing and abuse but it remained unchecked and normalized throughout the entire book. She also made quite a display of using the N word to really bring out how ignorant and despicable her family is. Cheap and boring move. You didn’t have to go into that kind of detail. We really got the point from the beginning. Like a dog returning to her own vomit, the author continues to return to the values and presence of her family over and over and over and over. In the last minute and a half of the book, she attributes the visits finally stopping to her becoming educated. But it wasn’t, was it? It was because they finally refused to see her after her father had prophesied that the devil had taken her over."

She had no idea what it was and could not really wrap her head around the concept. When I asked her later what she wanted to be when she grows up she told me she wanted to be a pilot…… Reading this book makes me wonder whether she has realised what her mother had cost her.This memoir is more than just focusing on parental neglect with providing schooling for their children. Its about the power of religious dogma and the power of family even if that family is toxic.But there is one thing that kept on bothering me. How was it possible that not only 1 but 3 of the 7 siblings was able to achieve not only degrees but PHD’s? I know nothing of the American education system but that feels almost too fantastical to believe. Perhaps their home schooling was not as lacking as it was made out to be. I feel a bit conflicted on that front.Even with the above mentioned, overall I am glad I read this and decided to round up my rating to a full 4 stars as I think the author spoke her truth the way she remembers it. The physical abuse she had to learn to stand up to, the desire to achieve more than what her family made her believe she could and the way education opened doors to opportunities she could never have dreamt of. But I can’t help but wonder if she had waited a few years to work through her trauma and then tell her story from a position of wisdom and hindsight, whether it would not have been better."

He also didn’t believe in schools, which is why Westover first set foot in a classroom at the age of 17 in college (she’s since gotten a PhD from Cambridge). But the most interesting aspect for me was seeing the evolution of her views, from a child who shared her parents’ take on everything to a woman who realized that in order to honor her own experience of the world she could no longer swallow everything they said.

Here is another way, and if it is true that dysfunctional families are the fertilizer of inspiration for memoirs, I give you Exhibit A. Furthermore, if rubbernecking is your pleasure, limber your neck up. This Mormon family is one twisted lot, and this little girl gets an upbringing that would be any girl's worst nightmare. Daddy is an end-of-days sort who trusts schools, the government, and gentiles (anyone who is not an orthodox Mormon) about as far as he can throw them. Meanwhile, Momma is an oil and herbalist homeschooling type who stands by her man. (And what is it with women who stand by their men, against all odds?)Anyway, if you think the focus of this book is education, think again. It's dysfunction. It's abuse. All wrapped up in Tara Westover, a young lady caught between a bipolar rock (Dad) and a bipolar hard place (older brother Shawn). What I like best is how well the book shows the effects of physical hardships on the psychology of the young. The education part is good, too, though it doesn't much come in till the end. Could I have read more of that? Hell, yeah. It would have been a reward of sorts. A break in the action. But it was not to be. This was about dysfunction, pure and raw. Bottled like herbs and oil. Delivered in episodic waves that will wash over you for a few days after completion.Consider it an education. One you're glad you never had."

“There’s a sense of sovereignty that comes from life on a mountain...”
 Tara Westover gifts a thought provoking memoir that was real, raw, and gripping. This is a young girl’s account through the years of being raised by her Mormon survivalist parents. She’s ‘educated’ by her parent’s ideals and held accordingly. “[Educated] can mean informed, fearless, intelligent, arrogant, brainwashed,” she said. “Part of the way that I would define education was getting access to other points of view.”I found so many aspects of her accounts haunting. I was able to connect to her love for her family and her struggle to find her own thoughts outside of theirs. Overall, this is a truly well done story as a reader of generally romance I was engrossed by this memoir. My only complaint would be that I felt the details of some injuries was too much. Other than that, I feel every reader can find something to relate to in this book. 
“My life was narrated for me by others. Their voices were forceful, emphatic, absolute. It had never occurred to me that my voice might be as strong as theirs.”

I listened to the audiobook (which was great), and I had to take more than a few breaks because of the content.'Westover grew up in a fundamentalists household with an abusive brother, and arguably an abusive father as well. It's painful to read. This is the kind of book that had it been in a novel, I can't imagine any editor picking it up because some of the things that happen to Westover and to other members of her family are so horrific. I don't think I was ready for just how gruesome parts of this book are--we're talking descriptions of severe burns, cuts down to the bone, brain and facial injuries. I don't quite know how to articulate this, but at times Westover's descriptions of her academic career felt a bit odd. I think this came from a desire to convey the sense of imposter syndrome she felt, and this definitely comes across b/c her academic success seems to come out of left field. I would have appreciated a bit more time dedicated to examining how she went from someone who didn't know what the Holocaust is to someone who was getting A's in their classes. I can better understand the jump from good student to highly regarded scholar, but that initial jump felt a bit too abrupt. "
227,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline,Rating 1 out of 5,"***NO SPOILERS***I read the first three chapters and let this go. One star on Goodreads means I didn't like it, and I didn't. Dare I say I was bored? Although Westover writes well, her style is distant and the focus in the opening chapters scattered. I read more about her grandmothers, father, and mother than I did about her, and this memoir is, after all, about her. Learning about her mother’s training in midwifery was interesting, but I question the relevance of that much detail. Also problematic is the lack of intimacy and vulnerability. Memoirs demand emotion. My understanding is that the second half of Educated is more engaging than the first half as it concerns Westover's actual, well, education and is about her overall and less so about her family; however, I wasn't up for the slog that is the first half. NOTE: Thank you to the publisher, who mailed me a free copy in March 2018."

I would read a chapter and find myself so engrossed in what’s happening only for the author to at the end say she doesn’t remember if it actually happened. So then if you don’t remember why are you writing a memoir?? It may as well be a fiction story. 2. I honestly don’t care about this story. I lost interest around 27%. 3. This isn’t really a survivalist story. I mean they had a tv, car, went to restaurants, etc. I refuse to waste any more of my precious time."

231,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7317186-celeste,Rating 5 out of 5,"Tara Westover’s Educated is a case of truth being stranger than fiction. I seldom read nonfiction because I often have a hard time connecting to a book if it doesn’t have a compelling story to tell, and will find myself fighting boredom and finally abandoning the book. That was never a danger with Educated. Westover’s memoir is horrifying and poignant and powerful, and it captivated me in a way that few books outside the fantasy genre have. It’s a story that I can’t stop thinking about, and I truly believe that it will stay with me for a long time to come. It also made me insanely thankful for my family and upbringing, my freedom and education.“My life was narrated for me by others. Their voices were forceful, emphatic, absolute. It had never occurred to me that my voice might be as strong as theirs.”Tara was raised on Buck’s Peak with her sister and five brothers. Her mother was an herbalist and midwife, and her father was a scrapper who set his kids to work in his junkyard as soon as they were able. The Westover’s were survivalists, constantly preparing for the end of the world, which they believed was imminent. They were a family of fundamentalist Mormons who deeply distrusted the government and the medical establishment. Their theology and practices were skewed and dangerous. The four youngest children were delivered at home, without medical assistance or birth certificates. With no birth certificates, the government didn’t know that the children existed, and thus their parents did not have to send them to school; they distrusted the education system, as well. “We are all of us more complicated than the roles we are assigned in the stories other people tell.”Tara was the youngest of the siblings, though no one could even recall her birthday. She grew up quiet and careful and wary, and while she did her best to please her mercurial father, but something within her bucked against his iron-fisted control and wild mood swings. At seventeen, Tara entered a classroom for the first time, at Brigham Young University. She would struggle between her thirst for knowledge and her fear of losing her family until she reached a fork in the road, and would have to choose which to keep. “You can love someone and still choose to say goodbye to them… You can miss a person every day, and still be glad that they are no longer in your life.”Tara’s thirst for education was driven by her desire to understand herself and her family, and how her parents could rewrite history time and again, convincing their family that this new breakdown of events had always been the truth. She wasn’t only fascinated by history, but by those who wrote it. She gradually came to understand the abuse she had suffered at the hands of a sibling, as well as the mania of her father, and how those experiences had broken bits of her and stunted her emotional growth. Even after everything she went through, she had a fierce loyalty to her family, but she also realized how perilous her relationship with them could be. She had to come to terms with the divide between family and faith, between real truth and the marred theology to which her family adhered. “To admit uncertainty is to admit to weakness, to powerlessness, and to believe in yourself despite both. It is a frailty, but in this frailty there is a strength: the conviction to live in your own mind, and not in someone else’s.”There were so many things that happened during Tara’s childhood and early adulthood that sound almost too fantastic to be believed, and yet her writing has a ring of truth that is impossible to deny. I believe every word, though it hurts my heart to think of anyone having to live that kind of life. The injuries alone, sustained by both Tara and various family members, are appalling. And the fact that they never sought medical attention, relying instead on faith and essential oils, absolutely horrified me. I believe in God and in His ability to perform miracles, but I also believe that He has led our society to medical knowledge that He intends for us to use. The dangerous situations these children faced made me want to reach back into history and give them a safe home. There was also serious mental illness on the part of at least two of these family members, one of whom was Tara’s father. I’ve never been so thankful to grow up where I did, with the family I have, believing in the doctrine that I do.“You are not fool’s gold, shining only under a particular light. Whomever you become, whatever you make yourself into, that is who you always were.”Tara’s story is one of heartache, but it’s also one of triumph. It was a huge struggle, but Tara was finally able to create an identity for herself instead of letting her identity be dictated to her by the forceful personalities in her family. I have such immense respect for someone who could risk everything she knew like that for a chance at a better life, even without having any support system to catch her if she failed. Of the seven siblings, four never even attained GEDs, and their families all work for their parents. The other three not only went to college, but earned doctorates. Theirs is a family divided in more ways than one, and I pray that they will find healing one day. Educated taught me to never take the freedoms I’ve been given for granted. The freedom to pursue an education and to find and choose my own faith are incredibly precious, and this book reminded me to always value those gifts.“The decisions I made after that moment were not the ones she would have made. They were the choices of a changed person, a new self. You could call this selfhood many things. Transformation. Metamorphosis. Falsity. Betrayal. I call it an education.”You can find this review and more at Novel Notions. "

Gruesome accidents with vivid descriptions of injuries.  So I got this for a birthday gift. My bff always sends me a book and I think she thought this would be good for me since it’s about a home-schooled girl who overcame her family’s mental health issues to go on a earn a PHd. Feel good right?Wrong. This very well-written memoir is a living nightmare. *I* had nightmares after reading it.  The author was raised in an isolated Idaho community by an unstable father whose word was law and an enabling mother who escaped the house as a midwife and as an herbal practitioner. The father put his children in physical danger many, many times. If they were injured, the mother (and God) would heal them with herbs and salves. The father had a junk/scrap business. So while there are descriptions of the majestic area where they lived, the most vivid images came from rusty iron, heavy machinery that could (and did) maim and kill and lots of grease and dirt. The first half of the story describes her family, their business, the cyclical nature of their father’s moods and how they united against everyone to live their existence their way. They were preppers and pretty much hated/looked down on anyone who wasn’t in their family. The author’s older brother suffered several head injuries and became more and more violent toward the author. I truly think she would have stayed with the family if her parents hadn’t turned a blind eye towards her brother’s abuse. But she left for Brigham Young University and somehow (it’s not really that clear) she managed to get through college with no money and no formal education. She was then whisked to Cambridge, England and from there went on to Harvard to earn a PHd. How she did this was so vague and so unbelievable that it seemed like magical thinking/fantasy after the gritty reality of part one. The gritty reality did return with her parents gaslighting her about her brother’s abuse, then shunning her, and then trying to turn her siblings against her. The memoir ends with the author still not able to reconcile the two parts of her life. She’s been kicked out of the garden because she ate from the tree of knowledge. The overall feeling I got from this was that she knew she was taking a risk by stepping out of line and now she’s paying for it. So not a feel good story at all. I truly hope the author finds peace/purpose. I don’t think she’s found it yet – at least not by the end of this memoir.This is a very compelling read, but not one I would recommend. It is not a balanced view of mental illness (seriously her father and brother were monsters) , religion (I’ve known a lot of Mormons and they do not shun medical treatment or the government or other people), or education (how did she get a 28 on the ACT if she never cracked a book?). And that’s okay. This is her story, told her way. It doesn’t have to be balanced. I wanted a lesson or a moral or a breath of hope, but that's not here either. Read at your own risk. "
233,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16085558-jordan-tignor,Rating 1 out of 5,"I'm not entirely sure how to frame this review, or even how to begin writing this. The simplest way would be to just start like this:I didn't like it. At all.Once again, I found myself reading a book that had received a lot of critical acclaim and thinking to myself, ""What are all these other people seeing that I'm not?"" I'm still not sure what made everyone else really like this book when I honestly found it quite... bad.Maybe it was because after around the first chapter, my skepticism started kicking in. So many parts of this book felt like they'd never be able to happen in the real world. For example, how she manages to pay for a semester at BYU with money she made working at a grocery store. Sorry, not sorry, but I'm calling bullshit on that one. Just like I'm calling BS on her ACT scores and how she got into BYU. It just seems too far-fetched. Either that, or she got in on a fluke.Another thing that seems too far-fetched - how her and her family's injuries were almost all treated and ""healed"" by essential oils and salves. Don't get me wrong. I do think that it is possible for essential oils and alternative medicine to have some merit. But she's claiming that her dad turned himself into a fucking candle with a blowtorch and an improperly drained fuel tank, and miraculously, her mom managed to heal him with a salve. Per her description, he was burned not only externally, but also internally. Apparently, he couldn't swallow because his throat was torched and his skin was literally sloughing off, and yet somehow he managed to survive because of wound debriding, an enema, and a (most likely not at all sanitary) salve.As the daughter of a nurse, I feel safe in saying: Bull-fucking-shit.Burns are notoriously difficult to heal, even at premiere burn centers, and the person still can face serious complications such as infection even if it's a small burn and they're in a hospital. It can take someone who's burned years to recover, and yet she wants me to believe that her dad was healed after a few months?No. Not buying it.The one part of her story I refuse to poke holes into is the emotional and physical abuse she sustained from her family, mainly from her father and her brother, Shawn. I also want to point out that reading her depictions of what they did to her left me feeling physically ill, and I almost started crying in the breakroom at my work as I was reading it. This is a difficult read, not just for the fantastical nature the book often takes, but also because those bits are so vivid. If you are sensitive to anything like that, then I highly recommend you approach this book with caution.In the end, I kinda of wish that I'd avoided this book all together. It left me feeling more annoyed than anything else, and when I finished reading it, I may or may not have slammed it on the chair next to me and shouted, ""THANK FUCKING GOD!"" In the end, I really wouldn't be surprised if this book later fell into a controversy like James Frey's ""A Million Little Pieces"" did. Everything that happens in this book seems just a little too far-flung from reality, and I recommend everyone read it with a grain of salt."

235,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10314106-john,Rating 4 out of 5,"Educated is a memoir that had been recommended by a friend that had a somewhat similar childhood to the author, Tara Westover. Dr. Westover paints a frightening picture of her childhood through her early twenties. Her parents are devout Mormons whose entire existence seems to focus on the End of Days. Her father overlords over the family with an iron fist and psychotically iron will. Reading this book is somewhat like driving by an car wreck. The vision is one of chaos, catastrophe, and pain. Tara's life is a never ending cycle of escape from and return to this environment. In using another tired analogy it is somewhat like watching a B horror film. You want to shout out to her, ""Don't go! Don't take one step closer to the monster"", but she always does. Putting herself and sometimes others in her family in peril because of her presence.It is a very well written book. I could picture quite clearly her home on the side of the mountain and the other places she visits later in life. The characters are quite vivid. The location and the individuals, for me, were interesting because it is quite near where I currently live.An interesting read, but not for everyone.

It made me think of this guy in our section in law school named ""Todd."" I liked Todd, but he harbored one of the strangest quirks I encountered in my law school cohort, a group deserving of its reputation for idiosyncrasy: he had a major chip on his shoulder about growing up without privilege, being rusticated, learning practical shit. The guy went to Michigan for undergrad so the pretense was of dubious merit from the get-go, but he always hastened to explain that college was a fish-out-of-water experience for him, so he was really out of his element in our fancy-pants, elitist, East Coast law school. Whenever we had a certain type of torts case where one of us city slickers would venture our ignorant opinion on the degree of danger one should expect when, say, driving a tractor or operating a saw, Todd would hold forth about the differences between various saw blades/tractors, brands, and their attendant dangers, in ways that were rarely relevant to the subject matter and mostly, I suspected, served to telegraph his uniquely pragmatic set of skills which sharply contrasted with all of our nebbishy backgrounds. It was a curious display in law school, widely regarded as one of the least practical pursuits known to man.One time, my roommate had Todd over and he was opining about something or other; in my memory he was rooting around in our refrigerator, explaining—unbidden—that where he came from, a single bottle of French’s yellow mustard was more than enough to get by, thank you very much. But that story is probably apocryphal. However, I do remember him at one point saying something like ""Well, you know my parents didn't have advanced degrees or go to fancy schools, unlike yours."" I was quick to inform Todd that in fact my parents went to unremarkable local colleges, and had nothing more advanced than BAs, and that this didn't exactly make me hardscrabble, either. An odd sense of parity destabilizing his worldview, I think he fumbled and muttered something like ""Well my parents didn't either... and my dad barely graduated!"" But I saw his pretense for what it was.And that's what I thought this book was going to be—a Mormon, female J.D. Vance, some person writing a book about the path slightly less taken, taking care to embellish the rough parts. But hoo boy, was I wrong. Idaho must be the most dangerous state in the union, particularly when you can't go to the hospital or use medicine for fear of falling in debt to the Illuminati. Westover's story weaves mortal danger, emotional manipulation, abuse, blind devotion, and cultish insularity into a tale that is nonstop fascinating. You never stop rooting for her, and you never stop being surprised by how irrationally and perfidiously her various family members behave. It's simply amazing what this person was able to accomplish from such stunted beginnings—a take she would hate, but I think is true, regardless—and to tell it in such a vivid, compelling manner is a treat to behold. This one lives up to the hype!"

She tells of her authoritarian father, an abusive brother, and submissive mother. The family suffers from gruesome accidents, primarily due to a lack of taking basic safety precautions, which are treated with homemade herbal remedies. This book tells of the author’s search for her own separate identity apart from her family, which involves questioning the beliefs indoctrinated into her since birth. I applaud her for finding the inner strength to seek an education and pursue a different path for her life, even when it meant going against her upbringing. Due to the title, I had assumed she would tell more about her educational experiences. I was interested in what it was like to attend Cambridge and Harvard, but these experiences are not covered in any depth. I would call it more of a memoir of a dysfunctional family. She readily admits that these are her memories and others in her family recall events differently. It sounds like she is still trying to process what happened and I hope she gained some solace from writing about her experiences. I found it absorbing, though a bit disjointed and inconsistent in places. Recommended to those interested in memoirs about dysfunctional families or escaping from oppressive situations. "

Pe principiul ,,ce-o vrea Dumnezeu"". Din nou, să ne gândim câți copii sunt crescuți într-un mediu cel puțin atât de nociv. Alții sunt loviți frecvent, înfometați etc, dar nu îi văd pe rafturile librăriilor. - agresivitatea fratelui ei. Într-adevăr, acele pasaje sunt foarte greu de citit și te îngrozesc nu doar prin nivelul de violență, ci și din cauza impulsivității acelui individ. - tatăl ei nu le permitea să meargă la spital. Nu-i nimic, oricum toți se vindecau miraculos. Explic îndată.Au fost foarte multe dăți în care nu am crezut-o pe Tara și chiar m-am simțit jignită de pretenția ei. - mama ei are un accident de mașină, se lovește grav la cap. Ochii aproape ieșiți din orbite din cauza traumatismului, capul umflat, fața tumefiată și deformată. Nu merge la medic. După o lună de stat la pat poate urca scări.- fratelui ei îi ia foc piciorul și arde până cade carnea de pe el, dar între timp, cu piciorul în flăcări, fuge muuulți metri. Nu merge la medic. I se taie acasă carnea arsă, o cremă și gata buba. - tatăl se rănește într-o explozie atât de tare, încât până și cerul gurii și gâtul sunt carbonizate. Nu merge la medic. Se vindecă acasă cu tincturi și creme. - în doar câteva săptămâni, Tara învață tot ce ar fi trebuit să învețe în câțiva ani la școală, ajutată de profesori. Inclusiv trigonometrie... Ia notă mare la examenul de admitere la colegiu, unde nimeni nu îi verifică pe elevi să afle unde au studiat înainte, ci se bazează pe cuvântul lor. Totuși, ea nu știe ce a fost Holocaustul... - profesorii se oferă să îi plătească taxele, un episcop îi dă bani să își trateze dintele... Dar ea nu se plânge niciodată de nimic. Nu, nu! Lăsând la o parte că povestea ei nu mi s-a părut mai valoroasă decât povestea vreunui tânăr de la Acces direct, care a crescut la orfelinat și a reușit ceva în viață, problema mea majoră este scriitura groaznică. Absolut groaznică! Pur și simplu povestește ce mai făcea ea pe acasă. Serios, cum ar fi ca toți oamenii care au fost triști în copilărie să povestească pe sute de pagini despre neajunsurile lor? Ce vreau să spun este că nimic, în niciun caz o poveste tristă ca multe altele, nu o califică pe Tara ca scriitoare. Singurul lucru pe care l-am apreciat a fost apariția lui Tyler, fratele ei. El a fost primul care a plecat să studieze, el s-a aruncat în necunoscut și s-a descurcat fără ajutor. El a îndemnat-o să plece, a învățat-o ce să facă și a încurajat-o mereu. El este eroul din familia aceea, Tara e doar norocoasă că dramele se vând bine și e ușor să șantajezi emoțional cu ele. O carte potrivită mai degrabă oamenilor care cred în oameni și își irosesc fără tăgadă părerile de rău pentru oricine se plânge de ceva. P.S. din colecția Narator recomand Viața nemuritoare a Henriettei Lacks.,,Este ciudat câtă putere asupra ta le acorzi celor pe care îi iubești, scrisesem în jurnal."",,Dar ce a intervenit între mine și tatăl meu este mai mult decât timp sau distanță. Este o schimbare a oamenilor. Nu sunt copilul pe care l-a crescut tatăl meu, dar el e tatăl care a crescut acel copil."""

La vita è all'insegna del far fronte comune verso il resto del mondo con le sue modernità disdicevoli da cui non farsi contagiare e nel prepararsi per i giorni dell'abominio ( ipotizzati per il Millenium bug allo scoccare dell'anno 2000 e poi , allo scadere della profezia, rimandati a un vago futuro) facendo scorte di cibo e di munizioni e allenandosi ai combattimenti che sicuramente verranno.La scuola è considerata una tattica dello Stato per allontanare i bambini da Dio; ci sono due tipi di professori, spiega il padre, quelli che sanno di mentire e quelli che credono di dire la verità. I bambini devono avere ben chiaro che il sapere libresco è cosa inutile, l'unica cosa che conta è imparare a leggere, il resto è lavaggio del cervello e trucchi di Satana.La formazione è quindi affidata a un grossolano insegnamento a casa e alla presenza nella biblioteca domestica di 5-6 libri da cui attingere informazioni, oltre ai libri di argomento sacro.Una frugalità spinta fino alla spietatezza, il fatalismo mistico per cui chi si ferisce lavorando se la deve cavare da solo, gli angeli lo aiuteranno o al massimo ci sono gli oli e gli estratti vegetali che la madre prepara ispirata da Dio.In questo ambiente familiare di chiusura e sospetto i disagi e le tensioni si amplificano nel tempo e sono pronti ad esplodere a più riprese.Il percorso di Tara, autrice e protagonista , è lungo e faticoso prima di arrivare ad affrancarsi dal fanatismo familiare e a riconoscere nei suoi cari i segni della patologia psichiatrica che hanno innescato e mantenuto la chiusura totale verso la ragione.La aiutano nel percorso di crescita una attitudine verso gli studi superiore alla media e un certo numero di ""buoni maestri"" incontrati lungo la strada.È un libro che avvince ma si legge con un crescente senso di disagio man mano che la adolescenza dei figli mette più allo scoperto la patologia familiare e la ambientazione da Casa nella prateria diventa uno scenario di violenza e squilibri mentali sempre più conclamati. E nella ultima parte del libro, le continue esitazioni di Tara a rompere i rapporti con la sua famiglia patologica, il suo mantenersi oscillante fra emancipazione e sottomissione per tanto tempo, fanno spazientire. Ho visto dei filmati di Tara, volevo vedere cosa era diventata, volevo capire come si passa da quel Medioevo ambientato nella provincia americana, alle interviste nei programmi TV o alle presentazioni ai festival della letteratura.Non ho saputo riconoscere in quella giovane donna controllata e apparentemente sicura di sé la ragazza soggiogata e alla ricerca di approvazione che occupa tante pagine del libro, così come non riesco a mettere insieme la brillante studentessa di Cambridge e poi di Harvard che miete dottorati ed elogi dovunque arrivi con quella totalmente incolta che solo poco tempo prima confondeva Martin Luther King con Lutero e non aveva mai sentito parlare dell'Olocausto. C'è insomma qualcosa di incoerente in questo libro che impedisce di simpatizzare fino in fondo con la protagonista e che non so se attribuire ad una realtà oggettivamente estremizzata - dalle stalle alle stelle - o ad una narrazione che forse a tratti calca la mano per volontà di rivalsa o chissà cosa altro.Interessante ma non del tutto convincente."

Published 2/20/18Minutes ago I finished the book Educated by Tara Westover. I would like to have days, maybe even weeks. to mull this book over before even trying to put my thoughts on paper. However due to time restraints my review has to be now.So much of this memoir made me mad. The further I read, the more rage I felt. It was a wonder than any of these children made it out of the Westover family, out of the grip of their fanatical father and lying mother. I do not follow the Mormon religion. However I do have Mormon friends and they are by no means as irrational or dominating as Gene Westover. First let me say this is not the prevalent actions of a survivalist. The hording of weapons and food and fuel and the securing of a safe place to live - yes - a survivalist. The fanatical preaching of male dominating females and this stringent belief in the Bible and God are not, in my knowledge, characteristics of a survivalist. Those are the characteristics of a fanatic - a lunatic. My philosophy is 'live and let live', as long as I do not see harm coming to others. The structure of this family was ever bit as potent as the strong hold Jim James had on his ""flock"" or that David Koresh had over the Branch Davidians. The Westover children barely had a chance. I thought it was amazing that Tara made it out of that family. She was sucked back into that black void so many times, brain washed, and abused with no one coming to her aid. She will forever carry the scars of this horrific childhood. I applaud her strength and courage to fight her way out. A family just such as the Westovers, is the reason that my professors were unable to convenience me to spin my Masters Degree in Social Work towards working in Children and Family Services. The crime of Tara living under these conditions will haunt me for a long time, there is no way I could have faced this challenge on a daily basis."
247,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66513638-gtf,Rating 3 out of 5,"An interesting and somewhat bizarre memoir by a woman who grew up in a strict Mormon household, with an anti-government, anti-modern medicine father who made sure to instill his beliefs in his children. Tara Westover is many things: a survivor of abuse, isolation, dangerous accidents, and a top scholar - just to name a few! Despite the the highly unusual upbringing she had, there was still a trace of normality somewhere in her childhood home. However, her father's insanity and the unforgivable abuse from her older brother, crushed the possibility of a happy family. Though it appeared she was destined for a life of seclusion from society, her teenage years infused in her a curiosity and motivation to attend public school for the first time and thus began her journey of becoming a talented academic. Through academia and interacting with people outside of her community, Tara developed a more rounded view of the world, and started to wonder if she could save her abnormal family from themselves. Westover's writing has clarity and precision in this memoir. She is certain of the many details of her childhood that she remembers, and she is frank about the few details that she doesn't remember. Nevertheless, 'Educated' covers the full scope of life at the family ranch."

Yo lo llamo una educación.” —Tara WestoverEl libro es el relato biográfico de Tara Westover quien creció en las montañas de Idaho, Estados Unidos, siguiendo las leyes establecidas por su padre, un mormón fundamentalista que está a la espera del fin de los tiempos. Tara al igual que sus hermanos trabaja con su padre, no asiste a la escuela y no reciben atención médica bajo ninguna circunstancia, su madre se dedica a ser partera y práctica la medicina natural.La historia toca muchos temas, educación, fanatismo religioso, relaciones tóxicas, lazos familiares, salud mental, superación, crecimiento personal, amor propio, entre otros… No puedo decir que haya disfrutado de esta historia y no porque sea mala, si no porque no podía evitar sentirme triste al pensar que alguien puede estar viviendo bajo estas circunstancias; lo que en ella se relata es hasta cierto punto casi espeluznante, nos muestra como la enfermedad mental de una sola persona que puede dañar la vida de toda una familia 😢. Afortunadamente, también es una historia de que habla sobre el coraje y la fuerza para encontrar el amor propio. La resiliencia y la capacidad de reinventarse a través de sus propios medios, hacen que su protagonista merezca una ovación de pie. ❤️🙌🏻✨Definitivamente, es una historia que refleja la importancia de poder recibir una educación sólida y basada en el amor. Al final es casi imposible que esta historia te deje indiferente y no te invite a la reflexión."

Un’impressionante mescolanza di violenza psicologica e fisica.Perché la storia di Tara Westover parte da un uomo, suo padre. Non è un romanzo, non è fantasia si fatica a crederlo.I mormoni sono più che una setta; una vera e propria chiesa che negli Stati Uniti ha ben 15 milioni di seguaci (numero approssimativo ed in continua crescita) e che ha come fondamento la rivelazione continua. Così il padre di Tara è spesso interpellato da voci divine che gli indicano la strada da seguire e così dirige la sua famiglia su binari di un cinico estremismo. In un clima da guerriglia dichiara guerra allo stato che è individuato come il primo nemico: solo i primi due figli hanno un certificato di nascita e hanno frequentato qualche anno di scuola. Nessuno ha un libretto sanitario. La madre succube e sottomessa si specializzerà come levatrice e naturopata condividendo il crescente fanatismo. I giorni sono una continua preparazione ai giorni dell’Abominio: una sorta di giudizio universale per cui si accumulano scorte e si lavora per l’autosufficienza:” Ero cresciuta preparandomi ai Giorni dell’Abominio, quando il sole si sarebbe oscurato e la luna avrebbe grondato un liquido simil-sangue. Passavo le estati a inscatolare pesche e gli inverni a fare la rotazione delle provviste. Quando il Regno dell’Uomo sarebbe finito, la mia famiglia avrebbe continuato indisturbata.”Questa storia è un impasto di crudeli malvagità che plasmano le menti bambine tante da deformarne la visione delle cose e da annullarne ogni pensiero autonomo e personale. ” La mia vita era una narrazione in mano ad altri. Le loro voci erano decise, enfatiche, categoriche. Non avevo mai pensato che la mia voce potesse essere forte quanto le loro.”Shawn, fratello maggiore subirà vari incidenti che assommati alla manipolazione della famiglia lo renderanno estremamente violento e pericoloso anche verso Tara e l’altra sorella.Un racconto doloroso in cui si sente il processo laborioso in cui Tara ha scavato dentro di sé e la sua memoria.Quello del ricordo è un tema importante proprio perché vittima di una manipolazione psicologica dove una pressione forte e profonda può addirittura influire sulla percezione della realtà:«ma successo proprio così?» continua a chiedersi. «E’ successo davvero o l’ho sognato? E se fossi pazza?». Nella sua infanzia ed adolescenza, tuttavia, Tara ha lasciato delle tracce tangibili, dei sassolini come Pollicino: i suoi diari. Parole vergate spesso con mano tremante a cui si appiglierà anni dopo per avere la conferma dei suoi incubi.” Siamo tutti molto più complessi di quel che traspare dai ricordi altrui. Questo è particolarmente vero nelle famiglie.”In realtà, la follia è nel padre non è solo nel radicalismo ma si fonda su una vera e propria patologia, ossia il bipolarismo. Un disturbo che si irradia ferendo e contagiando ogni singolo componente di questa famiglia. Tara si allontana facendo continui ritorni perché comunque e sempre è doloroso recidere anche da chi ti ha continuamente ferito.Il contesto di sopraffazione assume un aspetto universale quando si legge la storia di brutalità dell’uomo contro la donna. Una guerra che è stata dichiarata dall’inizio dei secoli e che non si spegne. La donna nemica da sottomettere, calpestare nella sua dignità. Tara cresce con un fratello che le dà in continuazione della “puttana”: una parola che le si appiccica addosso tanto ad sentirla come una “sua” propria definizione e quando, per la prima volta, sente rivolgere il termine ad un’altra donna ne è stupita e quasi infastidita sentirsi derubata di qualcosa di proprio.” Potete chiamare questa presa di coscienza in molti modi. Chiamatela trasformazione. Metamorfosi. Slealtà. Tradimento.Io la chiamo un’educazione.”Una storia di un doloroso riscatto come donna, come essere umano. Molti spunti di riflessione su diversi piani di lettura: sicuramente il mormonismo, la questione femminile legata al contesto di crescita, l’autoconsapevolezza ma anche la questione (a me abbastanza sconosciuta e che sto da qui approfondendo) dei movimenti anti- stato (non mi piace chiamarli anarchici perché sono generalmente correnti suprematiste…)” Dicevo che ero stata povera, che ero stata ignorante e lo facevo senza alcuna vergogna. Solo allora capii perché mi ero vergognata tanto: non perché non avevo studiato in un conservatorio dai pavimenti di marmo o non avevo un padre diplomatico. Non perché il papà era mezzo matto e la mamma gli andava dietro. Ma perché avevo un padre che mi buttava tra le lame del Trinciante anziché tenermi lontano da esse. Perché avevo passato quei momenti sul pavimento sapendo che la mamma era nell’altra stanza, sorda e cieca alle mie richieste d’aiuto, e decisa per il momento a non farmi affatto da madre.”In complesso una lettura molto interessante cui non mi sento ti assegnare stelline."
252,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7074816-mel-epic-reading,Rating 5 out of 5,"How do you rate a book like this? A book that holds a life within it. Full disclosure: I did not like this for the first 3/4 of it. Educated features horrific farm accidents, abusive siblings, useless parents, and untreated mental health. But the hardest part to take of it all is that it's a true story. Tara Westover actually lived through all this... I did not want to believe that Westover, a woman with two doctorates, could so readily allow these things to happen. But she did not ‘allow’ anything; instead she was subject to poor luck and born into an un-winnable situation. And so she tells her story as she experienced it at the time of events; not as she sees it today. There is an important distinction here between judging history and telling it. Given Westover’s time spent researching historians for her later doctorates it’s perhaps fitting that she becomes a historian to all of us in telling her tale. What is most important here, that I realized at 82% of the way through the book is that everyone’s reaction to this story is different. Not because we all read a different story but because of our ability to understand and have empathy for Westover’s situational childhood. At the end of the day education is about more than just math, science, reading, and books. It's about social connection, psychological growth, and becoming a part of society. The quote below really resonated with me. ""Napoleon felt no more real to me than Jean Valjean. I had never heard of either."" It's not that Westover doesn't know who Napolean on Valjean are that is relevant; it's that these are people that are a part of our cultural existence in most of North America. Therefore by not knowing who they are she is missing out on a key piece of a complex culture.I didn't get what many people were hoping I would from Educated. It had been 'sold' to me as a story about hope, perseverance, and strength. There is no hope here, in my opinion, instead there is just a failure of society to protect children from parents whom are mentally ill, lesser educated, and incapable of properly raising a child (ie: putting them intentionally in harms way to save a couple minutes). It disturbs me that in a tight knit community, like most Mormon ones, no one reached out to this family at any time (or at least not that we are aware of). There is, of course, the relevance that women have no authority, power, or voice in Mormonism (like most religions). The suppression of Westover's Mother to know, inherently, the wrongness of what was happening in her home; and yet she turns a blind eye because that is what a good wife would do. These are the things I take away from Educated. That 'we' as a society need to do better. Without a doubt Westover has overcome all odds to even exist, never mind have two PhD's. But I don't think that is the story here; or at least for me it isn't. This is instead a story about the inequality that exists for children. The luck that is required to be born into a stable situation; and to be 'lucky' enough to be born into a gender, race, sexuality, etc. that will give an advantage in the world. Educated, for me, is a reminder that the world has a long, long way to go before we are all educated enough to be able to influence people and avoid children being raised like Westover was."

He never told me how I'd know when it was time to come home.""This not a simplistic life story and Tara takes the time to look at what happened as truthfully and clearly as she can. This has led her to some difficult conclusions.For example, Tara's father embraced a survivalist lifestyle not only because of his religious convictions, but also because of a deep-seated paranoia. It wasn't until Tara attended a college level psychology class that she realized her father's particular way of thinking could be indicative of a mental disorder.In addition to his erratic and paranoid behavior, the conservative nature of her father's view on the roles for women has had a long-lasting impact on Tara. It led her to minimize physical abuse that took place in her childhood home as well as struggle to find her own place in the world. And, until a life-changing accident affects her father's health permanently, Tara never saw her mother as an equal in her parents' relationship, which, in turn, seriously affected how she viewed herself in relationship to the people around her.All of the various events and family members Tara describes have far reaching consequences for her eventual life away from her family's mountain home. Her journey from the past to the future was extraordinary and makes for a great read.I had heard a lot of bookish chatter about Educated over the last two years and was skeptical about how good it might actually be. Those fears were ill founded- I thoroughly enjoyed this memoir, reading it in only a handful of days. I highly recommend it.There are some trigger warnings for readers who have struggled with mental disorders or been victims of physical abuse. This book also contains some slightly graphic descriptions of life threatening injuries."

This was listed on many people’s books of the year lists – not only book bloggers and booktubers, but everyone from Michelle Obama to Bill Gates. So expectations were high, but I wasn’t let down. This is an extraordinary story and an artfully composed memoir. Westover relates her tale of growing up in an extremely religious Mormon fundamentalist family with a domineering survivalist father in rural Idaho. Her childhood is so removed from the larger world she doesn’t go to school and her birth was never even registered. But in her teenage years she takes her first steps to starting formal education and integrating into society. The conflict of this break from her family and establishing her individuality is so heartrending, but it’s also inspiring in the way it shows how a person’s innate intelligence and resiliency can help them grow into the person they are meant to be. I’ve previously read some impactful novels (notably Claire Fuller’s “Our Endless Numbered Days” and Gabriel Tallent’s “My Absolute Darling”) about unstable fathers who try to live in a self sufficient way because they are convinced society is coming to an end and they force their daughters to live in a sheltered way with them.

PLEASE! JUMP OUT THE WINDOW! SHAWN. IS. COMING!” I had so many feelings during this book but the one that affected me the most was disappointment. Tara was constantly let down and betrayed by the people whose job was to love and protect her. I understand that there were some possible mental illnesses that contributed to the frequently explosive situations in the house. I understand that Tara’s father manipulated and controlled the family and therefore they were also victims. I understand that Tara herself was brainwashed into thinking she was at fault and didn’t have the ability to fight back for the majority of her life. It doesn’t lessen the disappointment I feel at reading about yet another child who was repeatedly physically and emotionally hurt by family members. Despite the difficulty I had stomaching this book, it was ultimately wonderful to read about someone who, with considerable grit and determination, managed to claw their way out of their harrowing life with the power of education.

She wasn't given even the most basic of tools to survive the World, and yet she did both survive and thrive. Although portions of this memoir are uncertainly told and there seem to be portions of the story left out, this is a story of personal growth, soul searching and self independence. There comes a time when we take responsibility for our own lives and decisions. Tara's road to this was harder than the norm. Despite the uncertain parts in this story of family & memory, Tara's struggles to become her true self are the real story here. It's a grueling story and difficult to read.

Westover has a uniquely compelling, incredibly harrowing survival story – survival of religious fundamentalism, survival of emotional and physical abuse, survival of being thrown like a fish onto dry land into a world about which she knew nothing. That she not only survived but excelled in this world, studying at Harvard and receiving a Ph.D. from Cambridge, is a testament to her intellectual gifts as well as her courage. And as this memoir makes clear, an inborn talent for exceptional writing doesn't hurt either.This is the ""it"" nonfiction book of 2018 so far, and it deserves the hype.

Not her fault: doctors are tools of the government, working to kill and destroy people and families. Also, anything bad that happens is God's will. The amazing part of this story is that Tara eventually escaped the family narrative, survived the head injuries, explosions, and car crashes (with no treatment other than wishful herbs,) and went on to write this book.

After all she endured, it is ironic that it was her parents' refusal to listen that finally broke them apart.

Мене бісило те, як Тара прислухалася до свого явно що звихнутого батька, мене вбивало ставлення її мами, роздирало обурення від ставлення старших братів. Як, як можна вижити в такому середовищі, де всюди ввижається змова ілюмінатів, де у школи, лікарні та решту інституцій, без яких важко уявити нормальне (і звичайне) життя дітей не пускають під страхом ледь не смерті, де батьки створюють сотні тисяч ""блоків"" свідомості, стереотипів - як, як з цим боротися узагалі?Коли Тарі вдалося вирватися в коледж, я переживала так, немов вона проходить цей шлях ось тутечки і зараз, а я йду поруч з нею. Якщо я з повною середньою освітою та двома вищими відчуваю себе повністю ignorant, то що казати про дівчину, яка всього цього не мала і занурилася в світ науки без будь-якої ""подушки"" знань? Словом, з другою частиною пішло ніби й легше, бо Вестовер почала аналізувати увесь бруд, в якому існувала більше п'ятнадцяти років і розбиратися в його плюсах/мінусах/реаліях, але й складніше емоційно, бо травми дитинства не подолають і сотні психотерапевтів та розмов з собою - вони завжди залишаються підсвідомими, нагадуючи про себе у найбільш невідповідний момент.Ну і те, через що історія Тари Вестовер стала для мене дуже особистою - її навчання, фінансові проблеми і морока з дисертацією. Я згадувала свої панічні атаки, годинне вдивляння в пусті сторінки (з дуже схожим бекграундом, чесно), відчуття, що валюся в прірву, тоді як навколо всі виринають на повітря, і зціплювала зуби та стискувала кулаки, спостерігаючи, як Тара виборсується. І їй, до речі, це вдалося.I was an incurious student that semester. Curiosity is a luxury reserved for the financially secure: my mind was absorbed with more immediate concerns, such as the exact balance of my bank account, who I owed how much, and whether there was anything in my room I could sell for ten or twenty dollars.The decisions I made after that moment were not the ones she would have made. They were the choices of a changed person, a new self.You could call this selfhood many things. Transformation. Metamorphosis. Falsity. Betrayal.I call it an education."

I had come to believe that the ability to evaluate many ideas, many histories, many points of views, was at the heart of what it means to self create.”It’s been a few hours I finished this book, but I just can’t stop thinking about it. It’s one of those books that push you out of your own circle and make you think of things you never did. I feel so much respect for this woman, who was born in a very conservative, abusive environment, and still took an active role to lead her own life rather than watching it lead by others.Tara Westover was born in Buck Peak, Idaho into a conservative Mormon community. She didn’t have a birth certificate, didn’t go to school, didn’t go to hospital. Her father didn’t believe in the government and any system that belongs to it. As she grew older, things got worse. Her father became very unpredictable, and she had a violent relationship with her older brother. At sixteen, she decided to educate herself. And this mesmerising journey ended up in Cambridge and Harvard.This book is about her never ending conflict between loyalty to family while finding her own truth and making a life for herself. It’s a beautifully written memoir with great talent and modesty. Throughout her story, I felt she was weak and strong, courageous and scared all at the same time. And I’m sure everyone will find a part of Tara in themselves.At times, the content was hard to read, and I’m very sensitive about reading abusive relationships in a very graphic style. But, Westover’s style didn’t cause me to shy away from it. Her telling felt very natural, not over the top. It didn’t feel like she was trying to tear my heart into pieces. She told what happened very calmly, as impartial as possible.I know I will think about this book for a long time, and it will be one of my non-fiction favourites.I actually listened to the audio book as well on Audible, and I loved the performance. So, I would definitely recommend it. Big thanks to NetGalley and the publisher Random House for providing a free copy of the book in exchange for an honest review."

Chapó para la autora.Es increíble lo que padeció en su infancia-adolescencia tanto con su padre, como por la indolencia de su madre y los maltratos tanto físicos como psicológicos de su hermano. Por eso tiene muchísimo mérito que haya alcanzado las metas que alcanzo, sin tener apenas una educación y al final logro ser doctora y estar en la universidades más prestigiosas del mundo.Valoración 7/10Sinopsis: Nacida en las montañas de Idaho, Tara Westover ha crecido en armonía con una naturaleza grandiosa y doblegada a las leyes que establece su padre, un mormón fundamentalista convencido de que el final del mundo es inminente. Ni Tara ni sus hermanos van a la escuela o acuden al médico cuando enferman. Todos trabajan con el padre, y su madre es curandera y única partera de la zona.Tara tiene un talento: el canto, y una obsesión: saber. Pone por primera vez los pies en un aula a los diecisiete años: no sabe que ha habido dos guerras mundiales, pero tampoco la fecha exacta de su nacimiento (no tiene documentos). Pronto descubre que la educación es la única vía para huir de su hogar. A pesar de empezar de cero, reúne las fuerzas necesarias para preparar el examen de ingreso a la universidad, cruzar el océano y graduarse en Cambridge, aunque para ello deba romper los lazos con su familia."

Είναι όμως και κατανοητό. Οι ιστορίες των υπερπιστών survivalists δεν είναι ευρέως γνωστές, πέρα από όσα έχουμε δει στις ταινίες ας πούμε, ενώ οι άνθρωποι που αποστρέφονται της κλασικής ιατρικής στην Αμερική δεν είναι λίγοι. Τέλος, για τις αμφιβολίες προς τα ατυχήματα που συνέβησαν, το μόνο που έχω να πω είναι πως η χειρονακτική εργασία και η δουλειά δίπλα σε μηχανήματα δεν είναι ακριβώς αυτό που φαντάζεστε.Υπάρχει όμως νομίζω ένα βασικό misconception για το βιβλίο της Westover: Ενώ ίσως θα ήθελε να είναι εντελώς ένα ""έλα να σου πω γιατί έχει αξία η γνώση και η μόρφωση"", τελικά είναι βασικά ένα πολύ προσωπικό ""ακούστε τι συνέβη στην οικογένειά μου και σε μένα, μαλάκες θα τρελαθείτε"".Κι αυτό, τουλάχιστον για μένα, δούλεψε καλά. Το βιβλίο είναι ευκολοδιάβαστο ως μια ειλικρινή, τουλάχιστον για τη συγγραφέα, καταγραφή των γεγονότων της ζωής της και παρουσιάζει την ευκρινή εικόνα μιας οικογένειας που μάλλον δεν έχουμε ξανασυναντήσει με επιτυχία.Η έννοια του χειρισμού, η ζωή υπό απόλυτη θρησκοληψία, η οικογένεια ως πρώτο και τελευταίο κομματάκι της προσωπικότητας ενός ατόμου και, ναι, οκ, η αξία της μόρφωσης είναι μερικά από τα θέματα που αναδεικνύει το βιβλίο.

Achievement enough, but still in her twenties Westover would go on to write this compelling memoir of her life. Frankly it's a wonder she made it out alive. Over the course of her story, siblings are skewered, brained, set ablaze and lose fingers. Her mother clearly suffers brain damage from a car accident and Tara herself is nearly crushed by scrap metal and barely manages to escape a perilous situation with a wild horse. Add to that the looming threat of her abusive older brother and it at times reads like a page turning thriller. Westover is a compelling chronicler, helped no doubt by her Cambridge thesis on histiography, the study not of history by historians. How they, like her, had to come to terms with their own biases, ignorance and partiality to recreate a world. She's careful to admit memory is malleable and often calls on her siblings who she is on speaking terms with to corroborate her story. The circumstances of her homeschooling to higher education would be story enough but Westover proves herself a talented writer here. It's a fantastic read that I also reviewed here: https://youtu.be/QY_lsblsRoM"

Writing a book is very hard, let alone pouring your heart and soul for everyone to read. She is very honest about not remembering every little detail of her past. Memories can be distorted and can be construed to fit the reality you want to believe or create. Tara openly writes about filling in the gaps by asking her siblings for help as well as reading her diary which she kept since a young girl. Over time, Tara found a way out of a family filled with physical violence, unnecessary outbursts of verbal insults, mental health issues, poverty, ignorance, mistrust towards anything to do with the government such as; health care, education, getting a drivers license, car insurance or something basic as getting a birth certificate. Unfortunately she had to distance herself from half the family but is living a productive and a happy life. Kudos to her!!! 👏Self determination, hard work, applying oneself to learning and dedication to education can pay off in the long run. I would highly recommend Educated. It’s a solid ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ from me. Enjoy!"

To put it another way: Bend my wrist behind my back and shove my face in a toilet once, shame on you; Bend my wrist behind my back and shove my face in a toilet twice, shame on me.I'm sure there are thousands more families in America just as dangerously ignorant and incendiary as this one.

Casi no me puedo creer que todo lo que relata Tara haya ocurrido hace nada, prácticamente. A día de hoy, ella tiene 36 años.Qué fanatismo, aislamiento, ignorancia, brutalidad, humillación,  exigencia... recibido de su propia familia mormona extrema.Ese sentimiento de culpabilidad por querer estudiar y conseguir entrar en la universidad, sentirse una ""ramera"" porque le guste un chico o por querer comprar unos vaqueros más estilizados, pensar que es una abominación solicitar una beca de estudios (las ayudas del gobierno son el demonio), o bien ir a un hospital o a un dentista (otra abominación), remangarse la blusa y que se le vean los brazos (indecoroso e impensable), perdonar las palizas y humillaciones de un hermano... es tremendo. Y no hablemos, más concretamente, de la obsesión y el fanatismo del padre. Lo peor provenía del padre y de uno de los hermanos. La madre, aunque no era tan radical, se amoldaba a la intransigencia de su marido. Curiosamente, los abuelos paternos y maternos no eran así. Ella no fue realmente consciente de todo hasta que empezó a estudiar en la universidad. Hasta entonces, como niña y adolescente, asumía lo que había vivido, pues no tenía un punto de comparación con las vidas de otros. Hasta que, llegado un momento, analizó y reflexionó. Y contó con la ayuda de algunas personas, además de contar con su propia fortaleza, forjada a base de una vida dura. A base de mucho esfuerzo, intelectual, económico y de lucha interna, su carrera universitaria fue un éxito. Pero ello provocó una situación terrible entre ella y su familia. Y le supuso locura y sufrimiento. Y hasta aquí puedo contar. 👌Muy buena lectura 👍 Ahora creo que leeré algo más ligero, para contrarrestar 😏"

It happens sometimes in families; one child who doesn’t fit,  whose rhythm is off, whose meter is set to the wrong tune.What an enthralling, memorable read with smooth, quotable prose. It felt like three different stories, seamlessly rolled into one, and I thoroughly enjoyed all of them.The first part of the book deals with the author’s upbringing, which was radically different from that of the average American. Enjoy reading about drastically different cultures from your own? I’d recommend this book.The second part of the book deals with the author going out into the “real world”, which vividly displayed a sharp contrast between the world she had previously known, and the one she currently found herself in. Enjoy reading about sudden immersions into foreign worlds and cultures (i.e., time travel novels)? I’d recommend this book.The final part of the book deals with the author’s insightful reckoning, which ends with the realization that sometimes toxic people should not have a place in your life, even if you do love them. The “crazy” you may have dealt with in your family could be a different flavor, but the aftereffects often taste the same and are so utterly relatable. Enjoy reading about dysfunctional families? I’d recommend this book.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: You can love someone and still choose to say goodbye to them.

In this powerful and emotion-filled book, Tara explains what it was like to not only survive her unusual upbringing but to thrive in a way that was inconceivable to her younger self.Raised by survivalist, conspiracy-theorist parents in rural Idaho, Tara never visited a doctor or attended school. She suffered direct abuse from her older brother and in some instances neglect from her parents. Believing there was more to life than what was offered to her on her family's mountain, Tara embarked on a course of self-study to take the ACT and was admitted to Brigham Young University. She attended, in spite of her father's warning that the school was too liberal (!) Away from her family for the first time, Tara discovered just how much she didn't know and learned that much of what she had been told by her parents simply wasn't true. She continued her education -- eventually studying at both Oxford and Harvard.Aside from her outward journey from Idaho to Utah and then the U.K. and beyond, Tara shares her inward journey.

Her family was eccentric sure, but seem to be painted as worse than? Each parent even completed 1 year of university each, as her brother himself exclaimed? At so many parts of this novel I screwed up my face in confuddlement. (Yes I made that word up) (Edit: Confuddlement is not a word but befuddlement is. If anyone needs a university education its me ey?)I'm not in any way downgrading the abuse, I feel this should of been explained further and possibly highlighted on. Especially her father and mother. But her education? I almost felt slightly angry. Government education grants so easy to obtain and all she did was make the decision to do it, in my part of the world that's not an option. With the right grants I could of studied further and I wish I had as much encouragement as she did. I'm a 32 year old mother of two, who would help me, how would I study further, who even cares - now there are some hard hitting questions babe.

This book will take you on an emotional journey but it is a journey you will love. This is a well written memoir about Tara Westover's struggle to get educated. Westover grew up in the mountains of Idaho with her parents and six siblings. They were taught not to trust the Government, doctors, and hospitals- most importantly they were ""home schooled"". Her parents are devout Mormons but do not let that fact side track what this book is actually about. I don't like to compare books but I have to say, this book reminds me a whole lot of ""The Glass Castle"". I remember having the SAME emotions while reading Educated as I did when reading The Glass Castle. I felt so defeated, sad, enraged, I honestly felt rage for Westover and the number of things she had to overcome. It takes strength and courage to tell a story such as this, I remember crying at some points of this book because I was so shaken by Westover's experience. I have to much to say about this book, there are so many things to discuss but I don't have the words. Just know, this is a MUST READ."

And that's both comforting and troubling. Other reviews can give you more details; I'll just mention one of my favorite aspects of her story: her description of learning how to read. Not in the ""A, B, C"" sense, but in the sense that texts are something we can engage with, not merely adopt or dismiss. I learned to read like this in grad school, but I've never seen someone lay it out in all its simplicity before. ""From my father I had learned that books were to be either adored or exiled...I read them to learn what to think, not how to think for myself. ... To write my essay I had to read books differently, without giving myself over to either fear or adoration. ...

Thank you, Tara Westover, for writing Educated, for bringing this book into the world. My favorite Portuguese writer, Nuno Bragança, said that writing a book is pretty much like giving birth. Writing demands sacrifice. Writers sacrifice their time, their feelings and even their sanity. It’s also a painful and devastating process. Yesterday, when I finished this book, I could only think about Tara and Bragança’s metaphor. It must have been difficult but I am so grateful!Tara grew up preparing for the End of Days. She spent her summers bottling peaches and her winters rotating emergency supplies, hoping that when the World of Men failed, her family would continue on, unaffected. She hadn’t been registered for a birth certificate. She had no school records because she’d never set foot in a classroom, and no medical records because her father didn’t believe in hospitals. According to the state, she didn’t exist. As she grew older, her father became more radical, and her brother, more violent. At 16, Tara decided to educate herself. Her struggle for knowledge would take her far from her Idaho mountains, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she’d travelled too far. If there was still a way home.First, let’s talk about the book structure and the writing. The story, which is told linearly, is divided into several chapters. Each chapter centers around a specific event. I think that worked perfectly because it gave rhythm to the story. I felt absolutely engrossed at all times. I read it slowly because we were reading it for the June read-along but I could have read it in less than a week. Although the writing is assertive and quite straight, I found a touch of innocence and sweetness. Just amazing.Now, this book taught me a lot and made me feel so much. It’s not easy to read it because there’s a lot of violence. Sometimes it was hard to keep reading. I had to take a minute to breathe. Educated will never be forgotten. It’s one of those books that alters your world, your perspective about family and education.For more reviews, follow me on Instagram: @booksturnyouon"

Wow, estoy impresionada. Este libro es autobiográfico, la autora nos cuenta sus vivencias de nacer en una familia mormona conservadora que no llevan a sus hijos al colegio ni al hospital por sus creencias. Creo que este libro es muy conocido por lo que no explicaré más.Me dejó con muchas cosas que pensar, destacar y debatir. Es muy ligero de leer, cuenta con capítulos que se leen rápidos y te permite hacer pausas y, por ejemplo, leer un capítulo cada tanto tiempo. Eso sí, te vas a quedar pensando en el libro durante el tiempo en que no lo estés leyendo y es fantástico todo lo que produce. El libro logra llegarte, lo pensas, sentís la angustia o la indignación. Y algo que me pasó durante todo el libro fue la sorpresa de recordar que todo lo que sucedía era real. La confirmación de que existieron personas así y seguí sin caer del todo porque hay mucha violencia, de todos los tipos, en este relato y no podía creerlo. Mi crítica (o en realidad por qué no le puse 5 estrellas) se basa en el final. Venía tan bien la lectura y de repente se terminó. Me quedé con dudas, con ganas de más o con un final más reflexivo. Me hubiese gustado que la autora deje una buena reflexión de párrafos sobre lo que ella siente que por fin aprendió o logró entender.

Reading about a young girl enduring so much trauma while still fighting to ensure herself an incredibly bright future was beyond moving—and hard to wrap my head around. Tara’s drive to educate herself from a young age (despite her family’s refusal to send her to school) was so, so inspiring.
“You can love someone and still choose to say goodbye to them,” she says now. “You can miss a person every day, and still be glad that they are no longer in your life.”
Educated—as you’ve probably heard—follows Tara Westover and her extremist, survivalist Mormon family from rural Idaho. She and her siblings were forced by their parents to go without birth certificates, public education or medical care for years. Despite this, Tara and two of her older brothers fought to go to school, fracturing their relationship with family in the process.
“My life was narrated for me by others. Their voices were forceful, emphatic, absolute. It had never occurred to me that my voice might be as strong as theirs.”
There is so much that can be said about this memoir, though I struggle find adequate words for much of it. Tara could have easily portrayed her father or her brother Shawn as caricatures because of the harm they’ve caused her over time, yet she includes positive memories with them both, making the whole experience feel so deeply personal. There were points where I felt gaslit by her family, as well. Tara’s entire narrative was masterfully written and really easy to follow; Educated as a whole was such a powerful memoir, one everyone should experience!"
286,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/873807-elaine-mullane-elaine-and-the-books,Rating 5 out of 5,"Almost everyone has read Tara Westover's memoir by now but I've realised I never posted a review of it.Westover was born into a survivalist family in the mountains of Idaho and was raised to stockpile, to stew herbs, to salvage and to support. She didn't have a birth certificate and she never saw a doctor or a nurse; every cut, burn, broken bone or concussion was treated at home with her mother's hebalism. The family was so isolated from other people and from mainstream society that there was no emphasis on formal education, and no intervention when Westover's older brother became abusive.When one of her other brothers escaped the mountain and enrolled in college, Westover was inspired to explore a new way of life. She taught herself mathematics, grammar and science, which eventually led her to take the ACT and be accepted to school. She was 17 the first time she stepped inside a classroom. Her quest for knowledge and independent thought transformed her, and eventually she went on to Harvard and to Cambridge University, earning a PhD in Intellectual History.Educated is such an astonishing memoir and a truly inspiring story. It is not just about education and what it offers an individual; it is also about the struggle for self-invention, deep-rooted and fierce family loyalty and the grief that comes with severing close but damaging familial ties. For me, it is a heartbreakingly honest and beautiful portrayal of an indomitable woman that begs the question: How much of ourselves should we give up to those we love?This is probably one of the best books I have ever read and certainly my favourite memoir. Exceptional."
287,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2745288-wendy-darling,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 stars There are gaps in this narrative that I can’t fill logically (I truly wish this book had gone through a couple more passes or had more early readers to help with that, or to help the reader accept the lapses in memory/memoir better), but this story is undeniably compelling. The survivalist stuff and fundamentalist Mormon background were interesting (though nothing that shocking of you’ve read or watched anything on these subjects), but the relationships with her family were even more fascinating. There is a distance in the way they are described, however; this may be helpful to the author in some sense, but it serves the reader less so. I think I appreciate the interviews I’ve read with the author even more than I do the book. The message of strength within a complicated family dynamic is more clear cut, as she has famously said, “You could miss someone every day and still be glad they’re not in your life.” Making the decision to live without someone is a wrenching, powerful, human thing and it is important to have conversations that destigmatize it, especially within certain cultures. Audiobook note: Julia Whelan’s narration is terrific, as usual. I always check who the narrator is before starting an audiobook, and she is on my shortlist of people I don’t need to sample. Side note: I spent several summers at Cambridge so it was lovely to feel a little bit of that academic setting here, even though I’m still not entirely sure how it happened. Miracles happen, I guess? A review copy was provided by the publisher."

It really pulled me in. • The story was interesting and gave me a lot to think about. I have a pretty intense history with religion so I found some parallels within my own life to what Tara experienced.• I read this with my book club and we had so much to discuss due to the intensity of the story. What I Disliked• A lot of the story was vague. I would've liked far more information about each member of Tara's family (I can't keep track of all of her siblings) and I would've liked to know more specifics about her schooling and how she paid for it. There were a lot of serious thing that were kind of skirted over and while I do believe this memoir is truthful, I would've liked to know more about everything. It seems that Tara had a particular view point and goal for this memoir, which obviously is her own prerogative because it's her life story, but I wish she'd have given more details about boyfriends, classes, other siblings, etc. "

Tara grows up in a strict/extreme Mormon household where he Father rules. It’s her story and how she breaks free from that life, really. She’s incredibly gifted and despite never attending school, she taught herself well enough to go to University. There are some awkward moments where as the reader, we feel her awkwardness and lack of knowledge about the world, for example she had never seen the word “holocaust” until she went to University and had no idea of what it meant. She’s an incredible woman and we learn how much her upbringing affected her mental health. It also shows how fucked up some families are in terms of memory and covering things up. A solid 3 stars"

296,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4886576-cody,Rating 5 out of 5,"Incredible. That is one of the many words that can be used to described Tara Westover's memoir Educated. In it, Westover discusses the raw juxtaposition between her parent's survivalist mentality among her and her siblings growing up in rural Idaho versus the metamorphosis she began to undertake from self-educating herself to being accepting to Brigham Young University to her eventual doctorate from Cambridge University.The main pillar of the book is Westover's perception of the world around her from being a young girl under the thumb of her parents rather stark viewpoints and the discovery of the complexities and ideas that exist outside the realm of her isolated upbringing. She writes midway through the book: ""I had started on a path of awareness, had perceived something elemental about my brother, my father, myself. I had discerned the ways in which we had been sculpted by a tradition given to use by others, a tradition of which we were either wilfully or accidentally ignorant. I had begun to understand that we had lent our voices to a discourse whose sole purpose was to dehumanise and brutalise others - because nurturing that discourse was easier, because retaining power always feels like the way forward."" (180) This contrast happens as she moves away her demanding religious father; a man who who's opinions extend from a shortsighted view of the Ruby Ridge incident, to Y2K, to the evils of socialism and non-believers of the Mormon faith. Tara is forced to work in a junkyard alongside her father and other siblings, a place that proves dangerous to them all at one point or another. Her mother, a herbalist and midwife by trade, is almost consistently both a willing and unwilling sidekick to her husbands beliefs, even as under the surface you can tell she's not quite aligned with him and wants better things for her children.Her introduction to subjects outside her self-education, like the civil rights moment or the philosophy of John Stuart Mills is absolutely fascinating to read. At BYU, she raises her hand and asks the meaning of the word Holocaust and is mistaken for a non-believer of the crimes against the Jewish communities during WWII, even though her question was genuine and she had no teachings regarding it growing up. While in England she discovers the grandeur of the buildings around Cambridge and drinks coffee for the first time, among other things, much to her own amazement and fear. One can't help but to cheer her on.Even with her parents extreme viewpoints, Tara comes to the realisation that her life is her own, and not something to be dictated by others. ""My life was narrated for me by others. Their voices were forceful, emphatic, absolute. It had never occurred to me that my voice might be as strong as theirs."" (197) Some voices, like her parents, would be harmfully influential, but others, like that of some of her brothers, would be supportive and guide her down the path through advancements in education.Another part of the book revolves around her relationship with her older brother Shawn. It's hard to say just what demons Shawn carries but it is clear he's a very troubled man. On one hand, Shawn is very protective of Tara, referring to her as his 'Siddle Lister,' a play on the words 'little sister' that comes from a road game the two played when she accompanied him in his long-haul semi-truck. Shawn also supports Tara when she auditions for plays, and even auditions himself alongside her, and is protective over her when she is working dangerous jobs for their father alongside the other siblings. On the other hand, Shawn is very dangerous to Tara as described in certain parts. On the more mild side, if one can say mild, he forces her head into the toilet and demands an apology. Even more alarming, Shawn refers to Tara as a whore and even calls her the N-word when her face blackens working on their fathers job-sites as an act of psychological warfare. He aggressively pins her down, pulls her hair, hands her a knife with blood on it and even threatens to kill her later in the book. This Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde persona of his is damaging to Tara as she tries to be a loyal family member and supportive sister, but you can tell it's psychologically gnawing to Tara and puts her in the most difficult of positions, particularly when her mother and father don't take her side. ""It was not that I had done something wrong so much as that I existed in the wrong way. There was something impure in the fact of my being. It's strange how you give the people you love so much power over you....But Shawn had more power over me than I could possibly have imagined. He had defined me to myself, and there's no greater power than that."" (199)Part of the sorrow surrounding Westover's memoir is that she really tries to make peace with her family, difficult as that may be with her traversal between seemingly two separate worlds. She writes: ""What is a person to do, I asked, when their obligations to their family conflict with other obligations - to friends, to society, to themselves?"" (317) That is something she can never completely due, but isn't for a lack of trying.By the end of the book, readers should have a sense of pride because of the struggles Westover has overcome to get where she is now. It's quite impressive, and because of that, the memoir speaks importantly to the empowerment women can have, and just as important, how we call all look for something better in our lives. ""Now, as I passed through King's College, in the shadow of the enormous chapel, my old diffidence seemed almost funny. Who writes history? I thought. I do."" (318) What an amazing journey."
297,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2908629-ellie,Rating 4 out of 5,"There is little I can add to what other reviews have already said. Educated is the powerful story of a woman who at a young age was able to overcome a severely dysfunctional family and become successful.Tara Westover's parents are Idaho survivalist Mormons. Although Westover says the book is not about Mormonism, the misogynist attitudes of that religion (as of so many others) forms part of the atmosphere of this story. However, it is certainly true that her parents practice an extreme form of the religion that seems at first to verge on the crazy and later plunge fully into it.I had some reservations about some of the stories but feel guilty. After all, survivors of extreme abuse are often not believed. It was even harder to believe how easily academic success (from never having attended school directly to Brigham Young University and then Cambridge for a Ph.D. and finally Harvard). Obviously, Westover is brilliant. So although her story is inspirational it's hardly a blueprint for others to follow. It seems someone should have intervened to save these children. Of course, this would reinforce the father's fear of the government but on the other hand it goes to show what government should perhaps be involved in. These are children who spent their days doing dangerous work, not even being homeschooled. But somehow Westover taught herself (with minimal help) algebra and trigonometry.Despite these reservations, I was mesmerized by both Westover's descriptions of life off the grid with a parent who was seriously disturbed and a family that she both loved and was terrified of. Her escape from this life came at a high cost. We are connected to our families, however bad they may be, and leaving them behind takes a psychological toll which Westover is honest about.Westover's continual efforts to reconnect with her family on healthier terms made sense to me. Children are often very attached to abusive caregivers and will go to great lengths to protect them. I witnessed this when I worked in foster care. Most of our children longed to reunite with their families no matter how crazy, neglectful, and even abusive they were. It takes so much to sever a parental bond; children want that connection so badly they are willing to endure all kinds of hardship and pain to maintain it.I found Westover's descriptions of her first attempts to enter ordinary society very moving and almost as painful as some of the abuse she endured. She had not been taught the language of ordinary social interactions and behavior and at first she rejects these skills as ungodly. After several failures, she begins to become more open-minded about the world and what it has to offer although she struggles with her self-image for far longer.It is amazing how the academic world opens up to her, almost unbelievably so. Again, all I can think is she must be incredibly brilliant. Grants and scholarships appear almost magically, the church steps in to help her out financially (and her experience with Mormonism outside her family's fanatic approach is much gentler and supportive although still narrow-minded in its view of the role of women).As with many memoirs, I am curious as to how she is doing now. I would also like to read other people's experiences of her since naturally her book is written through the narrow prism of her own perceptions. Her choice of career, which might be something of a spoiler so I won't give it away, makes sense in light of her struggles. This is a woman who had never heard of the Nazi holocaust or the Civil Rights Movement until she set foot in a classroom, whose knowledge of history was small and warped by her father's views.This book is fascinating and exciting. I read it in a day (home from work with a hurt leg) and it was as much a page turner as any thriller. I came late to this party but am glad I finally got here."
298,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3106785-beth-bonini,Rating 5 out of 5,"At age sixteen, and with no formal education whatsoever, Tara Westover managed to get an ACT score high enough to earn her a place at Brigham Young University. During her first semester - as recounted in this brilliant, disturbing, almost unbelievable memoir - she brought a class to a stunned and hushed halt when she asked what the word ‘Holocaust’ meant. Later, during a study abroad program at Cambridge University, one of the her professors chortles that meeting Westover is like ‘stepping into Shaw’s Pygmalion’. But, and this is an important but: the point of this book is not that Westover enters formal and ‘elite’ education as some kind of tabula rasa, a blank slate of a young woman - although perhaps that is all very true in one sense - but rather that she has already been ‘educated’ (ie, culturally programmed) in a variety of ways, just not in ways that are particularly helpful for living in the ‘mainstream’ world. The author’s journey is not just about being educated in the sense of being able to earn a PhD from one of the most prestigious universities in the world, although it’s easy to fixate on that (awe-inspiring) aspect of it. The real education of Tara Westover, though, is her long and painful process of deprograming herself from a childhood of cultural conditioning. Far more difficult than mastering algebra is the battle Westover undergoes for intellectual self-mastery: in other words, how she learns how to differentiate between the truths she was raised with and her own instincts and hard-fought knowledge. I was dimly aware that people like Westover’s family live in the United States, but I tended to dismiss them as a sort of lunatic fringe if I thought of them at all. Westover certainly brings her family to unignorably vivid life, though, and I will never be able to claim ignorance of their particular mindset again. Her parents belong to a particularly strict offshoot of the Mormon faith which exists in a permanent state of anxiety about the imminent end of the world. Westover never uses the word ‘prepper’, but there is quite a bit of description of the lengths her father goes to in order to ‘prepare’ for his family’s survival in case of major disruption or apocalypse (environmental, political or ‘end-of-days’). A generalised distrust of the government, which leads to specific rejections of the public school system, modern medicine and pharmaceuticals, means that Westover was raised without a birth certificate, without immunisations, without dental care and without any education other that what she learned from her midwife mother or could cobble together along with the help of some of her older siblings. In the eye of this storm is a (literally) crazy father with a Messianic belief in his own powers and unfailing discernment of God’s will. I thought that The Glass Castle was the ultimate memoir for dangerous and negligent parenting, but Westover has managed to swipe that unwanted crown. This is an extremely frightening book to read, and at times it made me feel emotionally overwhelmed and undeniably angry. The repressive sexual politics that Westover, and the other women in her world, are subjected to made me feel like the 20th century never even happened. How did she endure it, much less escape from or master it? While an entire generation of American children were being ‘helicopter parented’ to within an inch of their lives, Westover somehow manages to build up a stony heart and thick enough skin to survive her own childhood. I can only conclude that along with much else, Westover inherited the gift of her father’s own self-belief. Her story is hard to believe, but her skill at relating it - and her cogent self-analysis - makes this an unforgettable memoir. It’s sure to be one of my stand-out reads of the year. "

Me compré un ejemplar con la esperanza de aprender algo de historia y de literatura, pero no fue así. Era imposible, porque no distinguía la ficción del telón de fondo verídico. Napoleón me pareció tan real como Jean Valjean. No había oído hablar de ninguno de los dos».Aunque la premisa me picó la curiosidad, confieso que me decidí a leer Una educación movido principalmente por la tremenda popularidad que ha alcanzado a lo largo de este año. La autobiografía novelada de Tara Westover (Idaho, 1986) es uno de esos títulos de ubicuidad probada que no cesan de acosarte con su presencia hasta que aterrizan en tu biblioteca. Pero, ¿quién es Tara Westover y por qué ha causado tanto revuelo su historia? Una educación es una obra tan fascinante como estremecedora donde la autora narra su difícil infancia en el seno de una familia compuesta por siete hijos y unos padres que decidieron vivir apartados de la civilización. El padre de Tara, un pastor mormón obsesionado con el Apocalipsis, se erige desde las entrañas del relato como una presencia autoritaria y despiadada que, en su irracional convencimiento de estar siendo perseguido por el gobierno federal, no permite que sus hijos acudan a la escuela, vayan al médico o tomen medicinas. Acuciado por todo tipo de delirios y teorías conspiratorias, el cabeza de familia retiene a su mujer e hijos en un ecosistema rudimentario, sometiéndolos a largas jornadas de trabajo rural que, con los medios disponibles, se vuelven tan agotadoras como peligrosas. La insistencia en mantener un estilo de vida autosuficiente, apartado del sistema, provoca entre otras cosas que una simple negligencia pueda convertirse en una catástrofe letal. Con una claridad desgarradora, Westover describe lo que significa crecer y desarrollarse en un mundo sin referencias. A raíz de su incorporación al coro de la localidad, donde empezará a tomar contacto con otros niños de su edad, Tara descubre el alcance de su ignorancia y las consecuencias de su aislamiento. Poco a poco, impulsada por su propia necesidad y por el ejemplo de sus hermanos mayores —que consiguieron escapar de la tiranía paterna y labrarse un futuro más o menos apacible— Tara expresa su deseo de sacarse el título de secundaria y prepararse para el acceso a la Universidad, renunciando así a las paupérrimas lecciones que imparte su madre en casa. Esta decisión sacude por completo los cimientos del hogar, provocando una oleada de represalias que Tara Westover narra en su libro con una honestidad tan brutal como conmovedora.Sin embargo, el camino que recorre Tara Westover a lo largo de Una educación es mucho más que el de la analfabeta que consigue colarse en una de las universidades más prestigiosas del mundo (trayectoria cuya credibilidad, por cierto, ha puesto en duda más de un lector). Creo que el principal atractivo de Una educación, y lo que convierte, en definitiva, la obra de Tara Westover en una narración inspiradora capaz de cautivar a tanta gente es su forma de reconocer el papel fundamental de la enseñanza en la formación del individuo. Gracias a la educación que Tara Westover se labra a base de dedicación inquebrantable, la autora consigue los medios para romper las cadenas que la atan a su pasado, del que manan todos sus miedos, inseguridades y carencias afectivas. Sin los sentimentalismos ni los exacerbados momentos de lucidez que se suelen asociar a la literatura intimista, Una educación sobresale como el emocionante y valiente testimonio de una autora revelación: una mujer que aprendió, por encima de todo, a ser ella misma."
300,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6277675-monnie,Rating 5 out of 5,"Did I love this book? Not even close; mesmerizing but horrified seems to be the best description as I try to compose my review. Generally speaking, it's a memoir written by a woman who grew up in remote Idaho with Mormon survivalist parents who kept their entire family isolated; she was 17 before she ever entered a formal classroom, and by the time she wrote the book, she'd been to such esteemed universities as Harvard and Cambridge and earned a Ph.D.When I started the book - a recommendation from a journalist friend - I figured I'd be able to identify, at least somewhat. I've known a couple of folks who I'd call ""survivalist"" sympathizers; while they lived and worked in my real world, they espoused hatred of all things government, considered the Second Amendment a directive from God and spoke, mostly in hushed tones, of the many groups in remote parts of the country who are hunkering down, locked and loaded, waiting for the world to self-destruct. Besides that, I can relate to not wanting to live the life of your parents; like the author, I was eager to ""escape"" a traditional future like that of my mother and father - okay for them, perhaps, but not what I envisioned for myself. And like her, no matter how far I've gone from home I've never escaped those down-home country roots (nor do I want to; rather, I'm quite proud of them). Like the author, I loved my parents dearly, and I always knew they loved me. But unlike her, never once did they try to dictate what I did, where my life took me or what I believed. And for the love of Heaven, never would they have harmed me mentally or physically (well, there was one time my Dad gave me a whopping knot on the head with his bat when he was the hitter and I the catcher in a farmyard baseball game, but there's no question that it was an accident even if my mother never quite forgave him for it).So what the author lived through growing up - and I can think of no other way to describe it than as a living hell - is unimaginable to me, just as is her reluctance to leave once and for all. Or at least, it was until I read what she's written and came to at least some understanding of how she was - and to a certain extent still is - torn between loyalty and love for some pretty unlovable people and her need to reach her full potential, whatever that might be. Some parts of her story actually make sense given her parents' beliefs, such as making the kids learn Morse Code to ensure that they all could communicate ""if the lines are cut."" And having watched business owners bite their fingernails to the quick back in late December 1999, I understand her father's obsession with the Y2K thing (but perhaps not his despondance when nothing happened; after all, those business owners were pretty darned happy).Other parts, though, remain almost unbelievable to me - in particular, some of the gruesome injuries that happened to her and other members of her family, none of which were treated by conventional medicine. But her remembrances were fact-checked by editors; and even if some aren't spot-on accurate, they're close enough to give me chills. All told, it's quite a story, and one that made a considerable impression on me. Highly recommended."

I am so grateful to have received a copy of Educated from NetGalley and Random House so I could join my book - loving friends on the bandwagon for this book. I am there, but sort of on the ledge, one foot on and one foot unsure of where to land.The book felt repetitive and on the long side; and I know that some things that happened to her happened repeatedly, which is what made her early life so awful, so I should appreciate the many recounts and not be critical. Also, I should judge memoirs differently than the novels I usually read, where one can wish for a certain outcome, a happy ending or some resolution. Here I tried to hold a different mindset; but like in most nonfiction, my mind wanted it to wrap up quicker than it did.What Tara endured and how she overcame it was incredible, unbelievable, although I do not doubt her account. Some of it was hard to read and some hard to fathom. A psycho brother who wished her dead. A bipolar father who forced the children to work for him under deplorable, dangerous conditions. Difficult to understand how she would keep going back to her family for acceptance and validation, even after successfully turning her life around with an education any scholar would aspire to, and after that family spread vicious lies about her. Even an educated person may need to learn how to permanently say goodbye to people who are bad news. I fear her story is far from over."

The story of, in her own words, ""an ignorant girl who crawled out of a scrapheap"" to earn a university doctorate is an absolute inspiration and a fitting testament to her stunning achievements.The aspect of the book that fascinated me most of all was Westover's complicated relationship with her family. Her father is a total paradox: a man who clearly cares deeply about his loved ones, yet happy to have them work in a deadly junkyard and stubborn enough to deny them medical assistance, even when their lives are at stake. Westover also suffers extreme mental and physical abuse at the hands of her older brother, yet she keeps coming back for more, desperate to win his approval. And her parents do nothing about it. But even when she moves away to attend university and a whole new world opens up, her family are constantly on her mind. As the old Springsteen song goes, you can't break the ties that bind.It's amazing to think in this age of information overload that there are people who haven't heard of the Holocaust and the Twin Towers, yet it serves to show just how far Tara Westover has come. Her hard work and steely resolve have paid off in spades. Educated is a compelling account of survival, determination and well-earned reward."

Many of the details shared by Tara seem unbelievable--never going to a doctor or attending school. Despite her harsh beginnings, Tara gets into college, eventually attending Harvard and Cambridge. Westover learns much about the world and herself as she chronicles the loyalty, abuse, fear, struggle, and manipulation that she experienced in her own family."

310,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9281934-louise,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is a page turning memoir of a woman who had to leave her survivalist/isolationist family to breathe free on her own. As she recounts the events and feelings of her young self you see how some abused children respond to abusers and their enablers. Once aware that the emotional and physical violence she has suffered is not normal, she attempts to fix things. It is difficult to break free.This book has been heavily reviewed, so I will make a few observations:A difference between Tara (who eventually breaks free) and her sister-in-law (who doesn’t) is that Tara goes to great lengths to hide (to others and to herself) her shame. Emily does not hide her injuries and seeks help before she goes back for more mistreatment. Tara’s mother, who provides tepid (but welcome) help, at times admits that her husband and son Shawn are abusive, cannot sustain any push against the dominating bully that she married. As her business grew she should have been feeling more independent but she seemed to be less so. Has she made some mental calculus that it’s best to cope or does she, like an addict, rely on ingrained responses? Is she in Tara’s childhood stage where she shields herself and others from her shame of the abuse in her household?Despite the family’s suspicion of the “socialist” “illuminati” “corrupt medical establishment” the Westovers have catastrophic accidents (and unusually difficult child births), and do go to hospitals. When they do it is justified as a gift/blessing/calling from God. In the same vein (before the mothers’ success) I was surprised that, when asked, Tara’s mother produced a tax return.I am filing this book under “cults” because this is what Tara’s father is running in his household. Like Jenna Miscavige (Beyond Belief: My Secret Life Inside Scientology and My Harrowing Escape) and Rachel Jeffs (Breaking Free: How I Escaped My Father-Warren Jeffs-Polygamy, and the FLDS Cult). Tara, from childhood, was shielded from options and force fed a preposterous philosophy/religion. (Is there a similar book by a man who left a cult led by relative?) Tara had more resources than Jenna or Rachel. She had some exposure to town life and in her teen years she could earn her own money, have access to a car and had a brother who left for BYU. I searched and found LaRee Westover’s Bufferfly Express web site. Her catalog avoids linking her products to the practice of medicine, which was the foundation of this company. She leaves open the uses of the oils but for one part where she names different products as having a practical use. On a long list of ailments she has “Abuse Physical and Sexual: LeAngel. LeGrace, LeHeartSong, LeInsight, LeReconciliation. Wear as perfume; use in the bath; apply over heart area; on wrists; consider carrying an essential oil inhaler.”This is quite a book. I highly recommend it as an affirming story, but particularly recommend it for its exploration of the difficulty children have in leaving abusive families."

Review:""I was still ignorant enough to be surprised.""Tara Westover has a very compelling way of telling her story. She gripped my attention with her fiction-like writing that tells the tale of how she went from no formal schooling with survivalist parents until she went to college, and eventually a PhD after attending Cambridge and Harvard.Obviously, her life story is a pretty astonishing one. And her family is... a lot. They have their problems. She has many wild and/or traumatic experiences (truly, some descriptions may even be hard to read if you are faint of heart), but remains very reflective of it all.I kept eagerly awaiting, though, for the day she would leave it all. Once she was off to college, I was hungry for those details of her experiences. When she didn't understand events every other student knows. When she put in so much extra time to compensate for that. When she was in Europe and seeing the world with first-time, wide eyes, while her peers went about with eyes that no longer looked twice.""My companions moved through the city differently. Aware of its significance, but not subdued by it."" This reflection of how she now navigated the world, and how her education caused a major rift within her family, was very engaging. Her education itself is like a coming of age story.I wish we got more commentary on what she thought of the public education system in general. And the portion of the book from when she goes from struggling first time college student to PhD candidate seemed... short. She goes from struggling to excelling and getting these great opportunities without going in depth on that latter part. I thought with its title, this would be the part of the story we got a lot of. That some parts she would discuss deeper.Nonetheless, her desire to learn is nothing short of inspiring. If you need any motivation for that assignment for school, just read about how Tara decided to just buckle down and learn enough for the ACT..... with no prior formal schooling. And getting in a top percentile on her second try. It's not so much that fact that she managed it, but that she *wanted* it. For me, reading things like that is an excellent reminder to shift from the ""ugh I have to do 'x' "" mindset to a ""I get to do 'x' "" mindset. I GET to learn, to be educated. That makes me more inclined to finish my homework."

Tara Westover has experienced things that no child should have to experience. Her father, clearly suffering from mental illness is a hoarder, a nonbeliever in medical attention, paranoid about the e the world ending, continuously moving to new places, a survivalist of sorts. Her mother, complacent in many of the father's beliefs, focusing on herbal medicine as a solution to all alignments. Time and time again the children get hurt, to the point of almost dying but never get the proper medical attention. It was stressful, to the say the least. Then there is her brother, an abusive, mean, over the top real life monster who makes her live miserable. Somehow, amazingly, she is able to pull out of the ruble and reach her dreams. Only though the will of homeschooling and her love for reading (which she almost completely does herself) she is able to make it to the top of the educational ""empire"".Education is a heartbreaking, gut-wrenching, uplifting, phenomenal story of Westover's devotion to deliver herself out of the madness and into the world of understanding and healing. After finishing Education, I listened to Oprah's interview with Westover which was a great companion to the book. This book is beautiful and I recommend it to anyone!5/5 stars"
313,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7399266-camie,Rating 5 out of 5,"Long time chart topper Tara Westover's memoir about being raised in an abusive home by a disturbed doomsday awaiting Fundamentalist LDS father and a subservient mother without any type of formal schooling to later receiving a PhD at Cambridge, is one that pretty much lives up to all of the hype. I'm late to jump on the bandwagon especially since the setting is a neighboring state and one whose religion is predominantly LDS the same as mine. The fact that people can be living in these situations in areas not that far away, and in some cases right next door, makes it even more astonishing to read. The comparisons to Jeanette Wall's The Glass Castleand James Frye's ( a now admittedly more fiction than not Oprah's choice) memoir A Million Little Pieces have been abundantly made, and I agree especially with the fact that if you liked these two books you will enjoy this one as well.In my view everyone is entitled to tell their own story as they perceive it. I pretty much could not put this one down and the fact that right now you can buy essential oils and other products made by Westover's family's company headed by her mother who is an herbalist and the family healer since they don't believe in doctors, has made me curious enough to want to follow every interview about this author. It's a tough story to read, and even taken with a perhaps suggested grain of salt it's nearly impossible not to be moved by this woman's courageous story. 5 stars"

316,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3831795-nelson-zagalo,Rating 5 out of 5,"Para alguns, o passado de Tara Westover não é tão negro como o pintam as badanas e os blurbs no livro, porque em sua casa havia televisão e telefone, ou havia dinheiro para ela ir para a Universidade, e até para fazer estadias fora dos EUA numa universidade inglesa (ignorando as bolsas a que recorreu). Contudo esses comentários passam ao lado daquilo que este livro verdadeiramente nos conta. Não é o tamanho do buraco de onde a Tara saiu que importa, é a sua jornada e o seu efeito transformador, é a luta contra as crenças da sua família em nome de uma Educação. Porque o livro não se chama ""Educated"" porque a Tara fez um doutoramento, o título vai ao âmago do livro, tal como a ilustração da capa americana, a Tara foi obrigada a atraiçoar os seus valores essenciais enquanto pessoa, definidos pelos seus criadores e cuidadores, para obter a sua Educação. Porque a sua Educação não foi mera montanha de esforço, foi um caminho de não-retorno.[imagem]""Tara Westover tinha 17 anos quando pela primeira vez entrou numa sala de aulas. Nascida numa família de sobrevivencialistas nas montanhas de Idaho, preparou-se para o fim do mundo armazenando pêssegos enlatados em casa e dormindo sempre com a sua ""bolsa-pronta-para-o-pior"". No verão, ensopava ervas para a mãe, uma parteira e curandeira, e no inverno recuperava ferro-velho para o pai. O pai proibia os hospitais, por isso nunca chegou a ver qualquer médico ou enfermeira (..) Um dia, sem qualquer educação formal, Tara começou a educar-se a si mesma.""Talvez o discurso ao longo do livro, com Tara a apresentar tudo com a maior das normalidades, mesmo quando de pura violência se tratava, ou de lavagem cerebral ou ainda de coação, não tenha facilitado a perceção do que estava em causa. Talvez a excecionalidade das suas capacidades e de alguns dos seus irmãos nos surpreenda e faça levantar o sobrolho. Mas o que me parece ter maior efeito nesta leitura é a dificuldade que temos em compreender o quanto o ser-humano é moldável, e o quanto os pais têm capacidade para modelar e condicionar o erguer das pessoas que são os seus filhos. E que por mais mal tratados que sejam, um filho não renegado, não tem nenhum outro lugar do mundo para onde voltar, para onde se dirigir, a quem seguir. Mais ainda, quando convencido de que o mal-trato é para seu bem, para o proteger e dar-lhe o melhor que o mundo tem para lhe oferecer. Neste sentido, não é por mero acaso que Tara se dedique a John Stuart Mill e cite os conceitos de liberdade positiva e negativa de Isaiah Berlin no livro.O pai de Tara sofria de claras psicopatias, era uma pessoa que acreditava no fim do mundo e fazia toda a sua família trabalhar para armazenar viveres e recursos para o dia em que o mundo terminasse. O pai de Tara acreditava que a Escola servia apenas para endrominar os cidadãos com ideologia do governo, assim como os hospitais não tratavam, antes envenenavam as pessoas. Os seus filhos foram treinados para acreditar nisso, e acreditar nele. Quando a Tara chegou à Universidade, sem nunca ter andado na escola, nem ter aprendido em casa nada além das escrituras Mormons, ela não sabia o que era o Holocausto ou que a Europa era um continente. O mundo de Tara era a pequena aldeia no interior dos EUA, e em essência o mundo que o seu pai para ela tinha construído. Quando confrontada com outras versões do mundo, tudo aquilo que assumia como realidade colapsou.Isto levanta a questão complexa do que devemos fazer enquanto comunidades e estado. Aceitar que pais, apenas porque deram à luz, tenham o direito de distorcer as mentes de crianças e destroçar os seus futuros, ou agir previamente para que sejam dadas as mesmas oportunidades a todos os cidadãos? Por outro lado, a intromissão a este nível social é de tal modo intrusiva que coloca em causa a base da liberdade das pessoas, a liberdade de ser diferente, de acreditar em ideais distintos, de não ter de obedecer a padrões económico-financeiros iguais para todos. E acreditando eu tão profundamente nesta liberdade, não consegui deixar de sentir a mágoa do sofrimento de Tara e dos seus irmãos. Porque se os pais têm todo o direito de ser como quiserem, também deveriam ser responsáveis por oferecer a oportunidade aos seus filhos de serem um dia o que quiserem.Por outro lado, esta história é poderosa por demonstrar como a escola básica e secundária não é tudo nas nossas vidas. Porque alguém que apenas tinha lido livros bíblicos e mal sabia fazer contas aos 17 anos, conseguiu trabalhar afincadamente, recuperar 12 anos de ""atraso"", e em 10 anos não só licenciar-se mas também se doutorar em História (um outro seu irmão, com um pouco de educação formal, seguiu o mesmo caminho que Tara e acabaria a doutorar-se em Engenharia Mecânica). Ou seja, este exemplo vem também colocar o dedo numa ferida que temos discutido vezes sem conta, o valor efetivo da escola. Até que ponto esta não é mesmo o tal resquício da revolução industrial, desenhada para nos manter ocupados e aprender a respeitar a autoridade. Ou seja, até que ponto metade da escola e das disciplinas que oferecemos às crianças e adolescentes, não seriam mais do que suficiente para um dia poderem vingar nas suas áreas. Bem sei que parece mais fácil do que é. Tara nunca teria toda esta motivação e capacidade de esforço e sofrimento, não tivesse passado por uma vida tão dolorosa, e da qual poderia apenas escapar se se esforçasse pela Educação, ao que se junta ainda a filosofia de vida do seu pai, que defendia que cada pessoa é capaz de aprender tudo o que quiser sozinho, melhor do que sendo ensinado por outra pessoa. Num quadro normal, uma criança sem esta estrutura de habituação à negação das suas necessidades e ao esforço, só muito dificilmente aceitaria mais tarde realizar o esforço enorme que seria necessário para realizar um curso universitário.Quanto à escrita, sendo este um primeiro livro de uma pessoa apenas habituada a escrever em termos académicos, é bastante boa. Rica e diversa, capaz de imprimir ritmo e envolver. A estrutura assente em episódios por capítulos funciona também muito bem, já que muitos dos episódios acabam por ser bastante tensos, plenos de conflito e por isso agarram a nossa atenção. Contudo não é um livro perfeito. Como já disse acima o discurso está de algum modo atenuado, como que se por vezes fosse apresentado por alguém à distância. Por outro lado, existe uma sensação de repetição no que vai acontecendo, e isso deve-se ao facto de se repetir na vida real, mas existem formas de trabalhar a repetição, nomeadamente pela estrutura e aglomeração ou eliminação de eventos, o que nem sempre é realizado aqui, criando em partes alguns ciclos de situações que nos enfadam e até, em certa medida, nos afastam do universo do livro e da autora. Contudo, é um excelente primeiro livro.Publicado no VI: https://virtual-illusion.blogspot.com..."

Principalmente, riguarda i danni psicologici che un ambiente tossico e sbagliato sotto ogni possibile punto di vista può infliggere a dei bambini nati e cresciuti lì.Senza contatti col mondo normale.Senza andare a scuola.Cresciuti e educati secondo i dettami etici e religiosi di un padre folle ed estremista, indicato come estremista e folle pure dal resto della comunità mormone -che infatti tendenzialmente lui evitava, ritenendosi l'unico puro e rispettoso dei dettami-.Tara è cresciuta giocando tra le lamiere nella discarica paterna, e presto è stata messa al lavoro rischiando infezioni, mutilazioni, morte. Al pari di tutti i suoi fratelli e sorelle.L'educazione privata è stata inesistente.Nessun certificato di nascita, nessuna vaccinazione, odio e sospetto verso dottori, ospedali, burocrazia, stato.Lodi per la resistenza di alcuni suprematisti bianchi contro le forze dell'ordine.L'assoluta certezza di una fine del mondo incombente.E ancora, le violenze psicologiche subite dal padre e dal fratello, le assurde violenze fisiche del fratello che si sfogava con chiunque gli capitasse a tiro.E se da una parte all'inizio del libro si può sperare in un testo quasi avventuroso, la matrice autobiografica si fa sentire subito. La piccola Tara non coglie l'occasione di fuggire con la nonna per andare a scuola, resta in famiglia.E la forgiatura, la plasmatura della sua mente hanno l'effetto di farla sentire inadeguata, diversa quando riuscirà a farsi ammettere a un college.Ogni passo avanti che riesce a compiere, è seguito da una corsa all'indietro alle proprie origini, alla famiglia retrograda in cui è cresciuta, al padre bipolare affetto da manie profetiche, alla madre succube di lui che volta il capo davanti alle violenze, che fa da levatrice e inventa rimedi omeopatici.Lontana da casa diventa una studentessa modello, si fa una vita, accunula successi accademici. Ma come torna al paese, ritorna la sedicenne impaurita, si rimette ai voleri dei genitori, rischia ogni volta di venire picchiata, forse uccisa dal folle fratello.Rientra nei ranghi di un esercito dove la donna non può parlare e non può contraddire il marito, dove l'educazione è inutile, dove devi solo sfornare figli e sopportare le percosse.E il lettore non può non sbuffare irritato, imprecare, chiedersi come ci si possa comportare così.Perché non denuncia? Perché china il capo? Perchè arriva a dubitare di sè stessa, dei suoi ricordi? Come può pensare di tornare ogni volta là, di abbandonare gli studi, di implorare il perdono dei propri carnefici?Ma in effetti è proprio questo il danno inflitto dal crescere in quell'ambiente. Le ferite invisibili, i danni psicologici che impiegano anni, decenni a guarire, se anche ci riescono.E Tara è impietosa nel descrivere i propri pensieri, i passi avanti e le ricadute. Le crisi e le paure e il desiderio di gettare la spugna.Non sarà stilisticamente perfetto, ma non è una scrittrice professionista. E questo è il racconto tremendo della sua vita, che purtroppo non è eccezionale come dovrebbe (a parte per la parte accademica che le ha consentito di aprire la mente al resto del mondo e allontanarsi da quella sorta di pantano che era la sua vita in famiglia). Assurdo che cose del genere possano ancora accadere.Un libro che fa male, e che proprio per questo va letto."

É com esse nó na garganta que vos escrevo, também, sobre ele.“Só tenho sete anos, mas percebo que é este facto, mais do que qualquer outro, que diferencia a minha família: nós não vamos à escola.”Mais do que a pergunta ‘Como viver sem uma educação formal?’, a pergunta que me assolou toda a leitura foi ‘Como viver quando temos pai e mãe que não nos protegem do mundo e deles próprios?’.“Só então compreendi de onde vinha a vergonha: (…) Era por ter passado aqueles momentos no chão, sabendo que a mãe estava na divisão ao lado, de olhos e ouvidos fechados para mim, escolhendo, naquele momento, não ser minha mãe.” A normalização da violência, acima de tudo aquela que vem dos seres que deviam amar-nos incondicionalmente e proteger-nos de tudo, é a que constrói as pessoas mais partidas de todas. “(…) talvez um pai como eu desejava que ele fosse, um defensor muito ansiado, algum herói fantástico que não me lançasse para o meio de uma tempestade e que me pusesse boa se eu estivesse magoada.”Crescer a pensar que nunca seremos suficientes aos olhos de quem devia cuidar-nos com todo o coração, de maneira a que tenham vontade de nos proteger, é o que faz de nós as pessoas mais descrentes. Que faz com que sejamos, muitas vezes, a pessoa com quem temos mais dificuldade em relacionar-nos.“É reconfortante pensar que a falha é minha, pois isso significa que tenho controlo sobre ela.”“Não era tanto o facto de fazer alguma coisa errada, mas antes o facto de existir da maneira errada. Havia qualquer coisa de impuro na minha existência.”Nunca se vive, quando assim é. Sobrevive-se. “Lembrei-me que a minha vida não me pertencia. Podia ser-me arrancada do corpo a qualquer momento, arrastada para o Céu para enfrentar um Pai furioso.”“Na altura acreditava - e uma parte de mim acreditará sempre - que as palavras do meu pai deviam ser as minhas.”Tomar conta da nossa vida parece, nestes casos, tão difícil e extenuante quanto criar toda uma vida nova, sozinhos, sem saber andar e já tendo de correr.“A minha vida era-me narrada por outros. As suas vozes eram categóricas, enfáticas, absolutas. Nunca me ocorrera que a minha voz pudesse ser tão forte como a deles.”Este livro marcou-me imenso, acima de tudo, porque me identifico com muito do que a autora passou. Não é preciso ter as suas circunstâncias específicas para se saber o que é ter rachas tão profundas nas nossas fundações, que qualquer ventania nos ameaça a estrutura frágil. Tenho muito orgulho na Tara por ter tomado conta da sua vida, e por, todos os dias, sobreviver. "
320,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56146790-whitney,Rating 5 out of 5,"I am finding it difficult to put into words how much I loved this memoir. I chose it due to an interest in the question of what shapes a person and makes us who we are. Not only does this book delve into this question, but so much more. It examines the relationship between what we are born into, what we are taught, what we want to be, and what we ultimately become. Tara had almost every odd against her yet she shattered the mold and boundaries and charted her own path. This is a story of education, religion, love, resilience, growth, but more than anything it is a story about female strength and the need to always follow your heart.The good: I still have a difficult time believing this story is true. It has every element of a good novel but means that much more coming from her own voice recounting her experiences and personal memories. You become attached to the characters, the writing is great, and this is a story that stayed with me and I found myself thinking about it when I was working, running, lying in bed, and even after I completed it. It makes you think and question, and it made me so appreciative for my education and the environment I grew up in.The bad: not much to say here other than there are some heavy topics that are quite disturbing at times. This isn't ""bad"" but something to be aware of; this is not the lightest of reads. Be prepared to think and seriously question what education means and the ways that people across the USA learn and grow up. I also seriously wonder about what happened to some of the family, especially ""Shawn.""Something this made me realize- I often wonder about the point of a liberal arts education, especially when other countries allow students to go straight to a specialty such as a doctorate without completing college- ie. is the extra time really worth it . I went to a small liberal arts school and took many courses that taught me ""cocktail party knowledge."" I often questioned the importance of these even though I loved every class I took (especially literature and german studies and I ultimately became a veterinarian so these had little bearing on my ultimate career). This novel made me realize that education is a way of seeing the world and it comes in many forms. It teaches us to question things and continuously push ourselves beyond our comfort zone. I cannot recommend this memoir highly enough. 10/10"
321,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30248594-aj-the-ravenous-reader,Rating 3 out of 5,"Educated reads like a heavy literary fiction. It's atmospheric and beautifully written and I applaud the author for the unimaginable courage and strength she needed to write this memoir.It's an eye-opening read about people's lives most of us know nothing about and I appreciate the author for bravely showing the world the hard life she experienced and how she emerged from it, how she chose to educate herself or perhaps when we view it differently, how her upbringing by her unconventional parents compelled her to pursue higher studies, to become fully educated. It's life affirming in the sense that it makes you grateful for the relatively easy life you have always known.My problem though when reading is the constant doubt about the veracity of the events in the narrative considering that it's highly subjective and I suspect there were more than one exaggerations in the entire account. Given, this is how the author remembers her past but some or actually a lot of details don't add up. For this reason, I was cautious in treating everything I read from the book. This is also the reason why I usually stick with fiction- at least I know exactly what I'm getting into.Still, I will not discount the difficulties Ms. Westover surmounted, that she practically taught herself to pass the ACT and gain admission to Brigham Young University (she must be part-witch 😂) is already an unbelievable feat, not to mention the rest of her academic and professional achievements, eventually leading to a better life for her.For the author's writing and her great strength as a person, I give this five stars. But for the book itself with its numerous inconsistencies and, I surmise, several embellishments, I give it two stars making my official rating: 🌟 🌟 🌟 and a half. If the author ever decides to publish a novel, I would definitely read it.P.S. Thanks to my bestie for lending the book to me. I'm lucky I have a best friend who has opposite reading selections as mine so that if I ever wish to venture into non-fiction, I could just go and raid her shelf."

Tara Westover is an accomplished 30-something with a Ph.D in history, which is impressive enough, but phenomenal when you consider that she grew up in the wilds of Idaho under a bipolar, dictatorial patriarch who believed the government evil and the end of the world imminent. Her mother was a midwife/herbalist/faith healer. Until she got accepted into BYU, Tara had never set foot in a classroom, or seen a doctor or dentist.The facts of Tara's story are astounding. Her father was a scrapper and a lunatic, and he constantly put the lives of his loved ones in peril. A car accident nearly killed Tara's mother; a brother's leg was set on fire; Tara's arm was nearly taken off by scrapping machinery; her father even nearly killed himself, melting his hands and half his face in a careless explosion. All of these crises were met with herbs, salves and prayers, with nary a trip to the emergency room. It's a miracle Tara survived childhood, never mind sent herself to Cambridge and Harvard and gained the education and perspective to share her story.Amazing as her story is, I was not, unfortunately, especially enamored of her writing. The telling lacks punch. Her sentences are straightforward and at times inartful. She does an inadequate job of putting us in her frame of mind, which makes it frustrating when she doesn't act. Her older brother Shawn is hateful and violent, abusive and cruel; it is infuriating to see Tara stand by and watch him abuse other women without acting on her knowledge, even as she becomes independent and assured.I left ""Educated"" with an intellectual appreciation of Tara's journey, but it failed to make me feel anything. A tepid ""The Glass Castle."""

324,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42096394-jovi-ene,Rating 5 out of 5,"Provenind dintr-o familie de mormoni foarte conservatoare, obișnuită din copilărie cu toanele tatălui, cu munca grea și periculoasă într-un depozit de deșeuri, lipsită de medicamente și văduvită de școală, Tara Westover a avut puterea să treacă peste toate obstacolele și să își dorească să cunoască lumea, să învețe. Desigur, a avut mereu temeri, a fost manipulată încât să considere că doar părinții au dreptate în credința lor, se întâlnea deseori cu episoadele de violență și nepăsare din familie. Memoriile ei, scrise după ce a reușit să se desprindă de atmosfera apăsătoare din Idaho, încep mai greu tocmai pentru că nu suntem obișnuiți, majoritatea dintre noi, cu o asemenea viață, dar devin din ce în ce mai sfâșâietoare și apăsătoare pe măsură ce ne dăm seama de felul în care ea a profitat de singura șansă oferită (prin intermediul norocui, ambiției, inconștienței) și anume educația. Rămâi, la final, revoltat, dar și plin de speranță că, pe undeva, a existat un copil care a reușit. Dar câți alții nu sunt sclavi în numele unei idei sau a unei religii?"
325,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3829694-mlpmom-book-reviewer,Rating 3 out of 5,"I'm having such a hard time reviewing and rating this book because I both love and hate it. I love that the author was strong and took a terrible dysfunction childhood riddled with mental illness that was ignored and untreated and became someone better (and eventually stronger). But at the same time, there are so many inconsistencies to the storyline and behavior of her family members, her saying one thing and the next it showing something else (a person changing or in her words ""softening"" and then a page later slipping right back into the past behavior of horrible manipulations and abuse) that I'm not going to lie, it is fantastical. So much so that at times, it's extremely hard to swallow and hard to believe. SO much happens in this story that I don't even know where to begin to process it all, between the death threats, abuse and accidents...it's just a whole lot to take in an absorb. "
326,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70492479-mara,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was a tough read. I think it probably is for anyone (seeing how cavalierly Westover & her siblings' physical health & safety were treated is a hard reading experience), but layered in with some of my own familial and religious experiences, this really hit home for me. I think what I most appreciate is that Westover does not paint in black or white. She sees that there is a continuum between intention and outcome, fear and reality, forgiveness and reconciliation, and love and relationship, and she situates her authorial attitude smack dab in the middle of these tensions. It made for an uncomfortable reading experience, but a moving one nonetheless, and one that will stick with me."
327,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19224732-ana-avila,Rating 5 out of 5,"Como alguien escribió en Goodreads, 
Educated
 es difícil de leer, pero imposible de soltar. Imagino que fue increíblemente tortuoso de escribir. Compartir tu historia no es nada fácil, especialmente cuando implica “traicionar” a quien más amas. Pero compartir tu historia puede ser muy poderoso. Especialmente cuando, como Tara, pasaste años pretendiendo que no había sucedido.[Recomendación completa en Medium]."
328,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1136632-britt-brooke,Rating 2 out of 5,"For me to like a memoir, I want to connect with the author. I had trouble with that here. Westover felt like an unreliable narrator and I never warmed to her. The writing is uneven, as if written by two different people - one fairly mediocre and one with much more complexity. Plus, some aspects of the story just didn’t add up. I’m not saying it’s disingenuous, but there’s just something off here for me. I felt the same about The Glass Castle. "
329,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24544425-tamara,Rating 1 out of 5,"With my sincere apologies to the author if I am wrong, but her story doesn’t ring true to me. I’m not saying it’s a complete fabrication, but at the least heavily embellished. Assuming some percentage about her home life is accurate, her parents should be in jail—what negligent, abusive, stupid, and horrid people. I get the sense that Tara Westover tried to out-Hillbilly J.D. Vance’s “Hillbilly Elegy,” another book at which I took a jaundiced view. I have no love for this book. "
