Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestSo in my pre-review of this book, where I lamented about not being able to find a copy anywhere because of all the HYPE (seriously, I could not find a copy of this anywhere and the library had, like, a five-hundred year wait-- thank GOD for my sister sending me a copy as payment for watching her kitten), I said that the people giving this author shit about her choice of title were dickheads. Some people got mad at me about that, but I stand by what I said. Even more so after reading this memoir. I am seriously side-eyeing the people defending the mother, actually, because based on the accounts in this memoir, she was verbally, emotionally, physically, and sexually abusive. Not only that, but she coached her daughter into an eating disorder at age eleven and then managed her to ensure that she continued to starve herself. That's not to mention the stage-parenting, the freak-outs (especially while driving), and the fact that she wiped Jennette when she went to the bathroom well into, like, her preteens (imagine not even trusting your eleven-year-old daughter to wipe her own ass) and showered her into her late teens (sometimes with her older brother and also while giving her breast and vaginal exams, ostensibly to search for cancer, I guess).What the FUCK.Here's a hard truth. Some people are shitty people. Some of those shitty people are shitty parents. Being a parent does not give you a free-pass from all wrongs. Especially if you're just doing the whole parenting thing for a little human-sized accessory that you can live all of your failed dreams through. By the end of this book, I was kind of glad Jennette's mother died, too. After living under that kind of suffocating parenting, with gaslighting and serious emotional trauma, not to mention abuse, I would be fucking done. I don't blame Jennette for her feelings. And I love my mother. I'm lucky enough to have a pretty good relationship with her. And a few years ago, my mother got breast cancer, just like the author's mom, and I was so devastated that I felt like I was working in a total fog. I stepped back from social media and it was all I could do to focus on my day job because I was so upset. But I know that other people's experiences aren't like that, and we don't get to dictate how other people mourn (or choose not to). My mother ended up okay, but I would have been really sad if the worst happened, and that's because she was a good mom and she still works hard at being a good person. People who don't try to be good people are owed nothing. Why enshrine the dead if they leave behind a legacy of trash? The title is shocking but only because we tend to airbrush the pasts of the departed.I'M GLAD MY MOM DIED rejects this premise. In this memoir, Jennette McCurdy lays out her upbringing in painfully explicit detail, starting from her mother's hoarding and growing up in poverty in a house that sounded like it should have been condemned, to the way her mother forced her into acting and she ended up being the golden goose that kept her family afloat after years of living hand to mouth. She talks about the way her mother emotionally manipulated her, and her guilt. She talks about how she started to get body dysmorphia because she felt like the only way she could continue to be successful was to look like a child forever, and when she expressed this fear to her mom, her mom taught her how to starve herself, starting an eating disorder that would basically rule her emotional breaks and her relationship with food for over a decade. She talks about her hatred of acting, what it was like working under the man she calls ""The Creator"" at Nickelodeon (we know who), her friendship with Miranda, and her jealousy and resentment of Ariana. And then she writes about her utterly conflicting feelings when her mother began to die of another bout of cancer, still manipulating her emotions.This book stressed me out so much. I think it would be very triggering for people with eating disorders and people with abusive parents, as it is SO descriptive when it comes to these passages. It's also a brand new look into celebrity, because most celebrity memoirs are written by people who are still in the business, but this is kind of a fuck-you memoir written by someone who doesn't care if their bridges are burned, so she really unhauls all the dirt in a way that someone who probably wanted to keep working in this field wouldn't. It's really well-written but the writing can, at times, feel a bit amateurish. McCurdy has a lot of raw talent but the people hyping her up as brilliant are exaggerating a little.ALSO, who the fuck is calling this book a ""hilarious"" memoir? Are these the same people who were talking about how ""funny"" CRYING IN H MART was? Is this where we open up the floor to a conversation about how women's emotional pain and fraught relationships are often mined for comedic value? Why do people find it so amusing when women hate their mothers? My review is already getting longer than I intended it to, but this is definitely a trend I've noticed lately where I'll pick up a memoir that's supposed to be funny and instead it's just an emotionally wrenching book about a woman dealing with her trauma. Ha-ha, I guess. Fuck that. Do read this book, if you are in a healthy mental space, but gird yourself against the hype. It is not Jesus's Second Coming. It is just a very brave story about a woman trying to come clean with herself and the past.4 stars"
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11626803-val-shameless-handmaiden,Rating 5 out of 5,"I'm Glad Her Mom Died Too""Why do we romanticize the dead...?Indeed. Why do we?Before this book came out, my knowledge of Jennette McCurdy only extended to random gifs featuring her iCarly character, Sam Puckett. I didn't actually know who she was and what they were from, I just knew they were funny and fit my ""book review"" purposes. Here's an example:When this book dropped, however, I was drawn to the title, the gloriously vintage macabre book cover, and the fact that it was getting rave reviews. I was excited to read this and loved the cover so much that I purchased the hardcover drop instead of waiting for my library hold. I initially started this in early September, but for personal reasons I won't get into, I had to set it down for a bit. I have almost no triggers and can read pretty much anything without being all that affected, but - again - for personal reasons I won't get into, I found the details of Jennette's mother's behavior, narcissism, and emotional manipulation to be extremely triggering. And don't even get me started on the eating disorder triggers. I was also amidst a fairly stressful period in my work life, so I decided to wait until that was over before picking this back up. Fast forward a little over a month and my library audiobook hold was by then available, so I decided to jump back in with that format. Let me just say that I can't recommend the audiobook version of this highly enough. It is obviously read by Jennette McCurdy herself and I think she does a great job of it. I think the dichotomies of Jennette's life and story are very interesting and well explained. She is able to get across very nuanced and contradictory sentiments without sounding like a complete whiner. And that's a really hard thing to accomplish in practice. For example, she is able to outline how, despite understanding how privileged and ""lucky"" she was to be famous and on TV, she loathed acting, a lot of the fans, and the experiences that came with it all. ^See how assholey that's sounds just me saying it? Well, she nails it in the book, I promise you. I also felt very connected to Jennette and had a lot of empathy for her. I grew up in LA County and am VERY familiar with almost every location she references in the LA/Orange County area. I literally drive by the Westminster Mall (which she references being that she grew up in Garden Grove, and which is basically a nonexistent ghost mall now) every day on the freeway on my way to work. Also, I know I said I didn't want to get too woo-woo personal, but I will just say this: I deeply connected to Jennette in terms of understanding the longstanding effects (as a child who doesn't know any better) of being made to feel like you are responsible for the state of mind and emotions of another person - an ADULT person. For years. It steals your childhood, stunts you emotionally, and really takes a long time to work through. Some people should just NOT have children, folks. It's just that simple. I mean, what they say really is true: a lot of people spend their adulthood just trying to get over their childhoods. And that's even true for ""GOOD"" parents. But I digress. I liked how self-aware Jennette is. Or, at least, how self-aware she appeared to be in this book. That said, I also feel like this memoir came a little soon in terms of Jennette's recovery. She's very, very new to being on ""the other side"" of things. Although perhaps this book is a part of that, and so I can't fault her for that. And who am I to judge or criticize. Overall, this book was a great account of a very unique human experience. I will definitely check out any future books or content Jennette puts out in the future. And I'm rooting for her, her recovery, and her happiness."
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41736472-mariana,Rating 4 out of 5,"praying that Jennette makes more from this book than Nickelodeon could’ve ever offered with their hush moneyA truly incredible and hard-hitting memoir. Whether you watched Jennette’s shows growing up (like me) or you don’t know her at all, I think this book is a must read. I don’t want to go into too many details, so I’ll just share some of my thoughts:• The writing is easy to read but still poignant. I think Jennette did a great job recounting the events of her life. I especially appreciate how she recounted her childhood; she really nailed writing from the perspective of a naïve child who doesn’t realize how awful her mother is.• I love how truthful Jennette was about her own fuck-ups. She admitted she was very aware of how bitter and rude she had become, and how ungrateful she seemed (obviously, I think she was justified). • I particularly loved the section about Jennette’s time on “Sam & Cat”. It showed how much her addiction, mental illnesses and eating disorders affected her work; how much Nickelodeon mistreated her, especially when compared to Ariana Grande; and how resentful she had grown over the years.• The exploitation of children in the entertainment industry is something that really needs to be discussed. Seeing a child star expose the abuse she suffered in the industry is truly heartbreaking, but extremely important, especially in this day and age, where even more parents are pressuring their children and forcing them to put themselves out there for fame. I wonder if in 10 years we’ll see similar testimonies from kids of family channels who grew up making money for their parents in an even more disgusting way: by having they entire lives documented and posted online for all to see. • Jennette’s friendship with Miranda was so wholesome <3• A bit of a critique: I feel like certain events were skipped and only mentioned later in the timeline (for example: we never see her audition for iCarly, or how filming the 1st episode was, suddenly it was already 3 years into the filming of the show, out of nowhere we find out that she’d been to multiple events and red carpets, she randomly mentions she knows she has OCD and EDs – I guess she learned and came to terms with it off-page…). Obviously, this is a memoir, so the author knows better than me what was important to document, but still, some of these things seemed kind of crucial in my opinion (especially her learning about her disorders).• The main reasons I’m giving it 4 stars is because memoirs are not really my thing, so I ended up not enjoying this as much as the other books I give 5 stars to; and because, as I mentioned, I think some things could’ve been a bit better. But, again, I still loved this book and highly recommend it to everyone!(review written on 24/08/2022)---this title is BRUTAL 💀 i'm so happy for her 😌 can't wait to read it!!(06/04/2022)"
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/120806268-zoe,Rating 4 out of 5,"this is a very candid account on the abuse jennette mccurdy suffered at the hands of her narcissistic mother, and how that merged with her experience as a child actress. i don’t think you need to be familiar with her show, or even know/care about her as a person to glean lots from this book, and i think it's an important text that could even be considered historical, due to her nature as a public figure and the way her story is likely representative of a much larger population of child actors.for those hoping to get a “tea sesh” about the abuse rampant at nickelodeon, you won’t be getting that here, despite it being what the major media outlets are currently fixating on. jennette doesn’t shy away from talking about her experience with sam & cat (she hated it) and her experience with dan schnieder (terrible person, obviously, whom she never refers to by name), and even dedicates a short chapter to ariana grande, but this novel isn’t centered around that in the slightest, and to come into this book only for that would be a disservice to jennette's story.reading about the abuse jennette experienced firsthand is completely heartbreaking. she writes about having an eating disorder, given to her by her mother, and feeling beholden to her mother at all times. from calling her ten times a day to insisting on showering her even as a teenager, this book is full of triggering content, and i would urge those who have experiences abuse to proceed with caution. i think especially with gen z, we haven’t had a ton of actors from disney and nickelodeon speak out specifically about their experiences on set (the $300,000 offer from Nickelodeon jennette turned down may explain that) and how child acting impacted their lives, and it’s a very necessary perspective to hear as the consumers of that media. hearing some of the things jennette said about her stardom were jarring, in that as children we don’t really know what’s going on behind the scenes and mindlessly consume without regard to the actors lives. i also thought it was super interesting to get the perspective of a very self aware child star that didn’t become super successful on screen after their breakout role, and the narrative she builds around /why/ that was.this book was super impactful, and i have no doubt will reach a large audience. mccurdy's writing style is succinct yet impactful, well organized, balanced with seriousness and humor, told in a very blunt tone. i would definitely recommend listening to the book via audiobook which is narrated by her because it adds a whole new layer of tone. this was a tough reading experience, but i really loved the book and would highly recommend to everyone.Thank you to libro.fm/simon & schuster for the free arc!"

It’s time.When I was in middle school, my mother told me that my glasses were ugly, that the children would call me Four-Eyes. Interesting Fact: No one has ever called me this but my mother. She taught me a cabbage soup diet and how to put on trash bags and go running to lose weight. At the end of a long day, my mom swung by a fast-food restaurant. She demanded that I go up and see what the operating hours were. Being super introverted, I hesitated. She started screaming, letting off a stream of obscenities.While I was in college in my early 20’s, I stopped by my mother’s apartment for a visit. She walked right by me in the parking lot. She said that I was so fat that I looked pregnant, and she didn’t recognize me.When I was making $6.70 per hour, working part-time at Sears, my mother asked that I purchase a $200 set of pajamas for her. When I explained that I didn’t even have $200 to my name, was she sympathetic? No way. She laid into a guilt trip. Did I love her? Didn’t she do so much for me? What has that to do with I’m Glad My Mom Died? I know firsthand what it is like to live with someone who has Borderline Personality Disorder, and Jennette’s mom has the classic symptoms. This book really resonated with me.I’m Glad My Mom Died is an important work. It lets other people know that they aren’t alone, especially if their parents aren’t top 10% parents. Some parents are bottom 10% parents. It has been a long time since I have felt seen. The last book that I felt really conveyed the complexity of a dysfunctional parent-child relationship is The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls. Did I spend years trying to win my mother’s love? Yes. But do I want to be the person that she would love? No. Because I value honesty and intellect. Because I don’t define my self-worth by beauty or popularity.  Having a mother with borderline personality disorder has a profound impact on a child’s development.

I’ve known for so long that my relationship with acting is a complicated one. Not dissimilar to my relationship with food and my body.Both of them feel like constant pulling, yearning, begging, fighting. I’m trying desperately to get their approval, their affection, and I never quite seem to. I’m never quite good enough.
I cannot give this less than five stars, but it was horrible to read.This memoir wasn't initially on my radar because I wouldn't know McCurdy if she showed up at my front door. However, in the hours since I've finished this, I've felt compelled to familiarise myself with clips on Youtube. It gives me a chill to think that this bright talented young girl was concealing so much pain.The title is arresting, as it's supposed to be, but it's far more than just clickbait. McCurdy as an adult wrestles with her perception of her childhood and the pedestal she put her mother on. The mother who aggressively pushed her into acting, despite her protestations, then encouraged her anorexia and lied to doctors about it.It is hard, harder perhaps than I can even imagine, to revisit your past and understand that a person you have loved, admired and tried so long to impress has been a toxic presence in your life. 
People seem to assign thin with “good,” heavy with “bad,” and too thin also with “bad.” There’s such a small window of “good.”
As well as this, it's a portrait of the ugly side of child acting. Reading this, I found myself feeling that surely no child can give informed consent to becoming an actor. They are pushed and pulled between adults who fixate on their appearance, who criticise them, build them up and reject them. No wonder former child actors have such a high rate of substance abuse and mental illness.McCurdy's experiences at home and within the industry left her with an unhealthy relationship with food, her body and being a woman, a relationship that she is finally beginning to reckon with after both her mother's death and her own decision to quit acting. Though I did not know her before starting this memoir, this book invited me deep inside her experiences. I now feel an overwhelming desperation for McCurdy to overcome the trauma of her past and find peace."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57797254-cindy,Rating 5 out of 5,"As someone who’s never watched Nickelodeon or anything with this author, I was still highly engrossed in Jennette's story. You can tell she’s more passionate about writing than acting because her writing is of a higher caliber than other celebrity memoirs that were likely ghost-written. She describes events chronologically in such a detailed and engaging way, picking specific memories to demonstrate the dysfunction of her childhood. I appreciated her honesty, dry humor, and even her bitterness and negativity. Her train of thought is very similar to my own mentality (irritability, cynicism, being extremely critical of ourselves, etc) and having that mirrored back from another deeply wounded person was eye-opening. It makes me feel better knowing I'm not the only one who processes life this way... Can we do group therapy together, Jennette?!While I appreciate the level of detail in recalling these events (no easy feat for those dealing with trauma), I would’ve loved to see more reflections of the themes across the book, like her present-day thoughts on her family, Hollywood, child stardom, body image, etc. As well as her learnings from therapy that she’s incorporating moving forward, just to give the rest of us more hope! Regardless, I look forward to seeing her future work and wish her nothing but happiness."

I love that she was brave enough to write about her life as a child actress, to write about her narcissistic and abusive mother. This auto biography is intense, well written and unbelievably raw.  But it still is a book about a girl who was sexually, physically and emotionally abused by her own mother. Please, keep that in mind before you pick this up.  The title might be silly, but there isn’t a single drop of humor here. This is the most depressing thing I’ve ever read.  Again, I am glad it exists. I am so proud of this girl for being brave enough to put all of this out in the world. I am sure this will help other people who have been through the same.  I just don’t think this was properly advertised. This is one of the most intense, gut wrenching and uncomfortable stories you’ll ever read. So make sure you’re ok mentally before you go through it."

No flowery language or metaphors. That writing style made it feel really raw, transparent, and honest. And it very much feels like Jeannette’s voice. I would also really recommend the audiobook. It was so incredible to hear her story in her voice. The book starts out in Jeannette’s childhood and then progresses to her acting days and then to her adult life post acting. It was a devastating yet eye opening journey to see her come to terms with how much her childhood hugely negatively impacted her life and ruined so many healthy habits she should’ve had in her adult life. And to see how the abusive from her mom was a huge huge part of that. Would highly recommend as long as you check the trigger warnings first!"

There is a LOT of triggering content in this book. It doesn't shy away from facing problems head on and with an unflinching tone.I adored this book. It is so rare for me to be impacted this deeply.When I tell you I stayed up until 5 am to finish this book because I simply couldn't sleep without knowing Jennette would be okay.I grew up on iCarly. I love Sam. I watched this show with no inkling of an idea of what Jennette was going through. The fact that there are people out there that did know *cough* Dan *cough*, is sickening to me. This isn't JUST a look at how horrifying Hollywood is, especially child stars, but it's also a harrowing depiction of how manipulative love can be. The way a parent's all consuming love for their child can be weaponized and watered to grow into something this vile and life altering is absolute insanity.I truly wish the absolute best for Jennette McCurdy. I know she'll never see this. But my heart goes out to her and everything she has been forced to face. I hope she is awarded every ounce of happiness that a life can possibly offer. She deserves a life of no red lights, no lines, no pauses before 'I love you's. She impacted me so much with her honesty and I can't thank her enough for writing not only a horrifying story but also a damn good book."

 I was not a huge fan of Nickelodeon, and I watched their shows only once in a while during my childhood. Drake & Josh and iCarly were the two shows I watched. I particularly remember the part where Sam (Jennette McCurdy) talks about reading in iCarly, which became a famous meme. 

 Her acting in iCarly was spot on and funny. Jennette did a brilliant job while acting, which is why people like me who rarely watched the show still remember her.Whenever we hear the name Jennette McCurdy a bubbly, loud, energetic young lady comes to our mind, as her friend Miranda Cosgrove mentions in this book. This book tells us that there were a lot of hardships and sorrow hidden behind those energetic and brilliant performances. 
Seven key ideas from this book 

1) If child labor is unethical, aren't child actors too unethical? 
During December every year, when it is nearer to Christmas, there is something that everyone all over the world (especially in America) will do. It is to rewatch the Home Alone movie. The family dynamics of the McCallister family, ingenious script by John Huges, brilliant direction by Chris Colombus, fantastic music by John Williams, and extraordinary production design and sets will make us relive our childhood. Home Alone is pure nostalgia for many people. Apart from everything mentioned above, the biggest factor that brings us back to rewatch Home Alone is the amazing acting by Macaulay Culkin. I was shocked when I heard that he had to sacrifice his entire childhood to entertain us. He was abused both physically and mentally by his jealous father. The law caught him with marijuana possession. He was arrested for speeding and many other illegal activities. The abuse has affected his mental health, which pushed him into addiction.

Parents using their children as money-making machines by making them actors and making them overwork for different movies when they should be going to school has been a severe issue in the life of many child actors. If we closely observe the career graph of child actors, we can see that only very few become great actors when they grow up. In Jennette's story also, we can see that she was not at all interested in acting. But her mother forced her to act even from the age of six. Nobody even cared to ask her what Jennette liked to do. She tells in this book that she hated acting, which is why she quit acting after her mother died. If child labor is unethical, then child actors are also unethical. Then the million-dollar question of who will do the children's role in the movies will arise. If child actors were not there, how would they have made movies like Harry Potter, where most of the main actors are children? “I HATE ACTING CLASS. Even though it's a chunk of time away from Home, I don't look forward to this class the same way I look forward to church because I find acting even more uncomfortable than being stuck at Home.""  
2) How did the ""Creator"" make Jennette's life miserable? 
This is another big problem child actors face, the predators on the shooting sets. The author mentions a ""creator"" who behaved harshly toward her. This same creator also allegedly misbehaved with some other crew members in a sexually inappropriate way. We have heard about many child stars who were sexually harassed on the shooting sets. Some even make them work overtime, destroying the younger kids' enthusiasm and courage.  I think the only way to prevent child actors from being exploited by parents and crew members is by appointing an internal committee in every shooting set that even has access to mental health care professionals if needed. This committee should ensure that a certain percentage of children's earnings should be solely used for children's personal needs like education. This will prevent the children from being monetarily misused by their parents. It is challenging to implement this as different countries have different rules and procedures. A very few countries have tried to implement a similar method. But they were all disasters due to their lack of planning and coordination. If Hollywood and people in the USA start implementing it perfectly, all the countries may slowly follow it. A similar rule should be implemented for the children on social media (especially a few family channels on youtube.), even though it will be a little bit more complicated to implement in those cases.“Cut!” The Creator yells off camera, his mouth full of something.""“But our wardrobe designer said that The Creator explicitly asked for bikinis, and so she had to at least have me try on one or two of them so he had the option. ”  
3) How are children's life affected by their narcissistic parents? 
Falling into a narcissistic romantic relationship is a harrowing experience. Being the daughter of a narcissistic mother is a much more painful experience. This book shows how her mother totally controlled her daughter's life. The author tells us how proper medical help and therapy after such a long physical and mental abuse helped her recover from such abysmal despair. ""My mother emotionally, physically and mentally abused me in ways that will forever impact me.""""I realize that she's happy and I'm not. Her happiness came at the cost of mine. I feel robbed and exploited.""  
4) Do we need to romanticize the dead? 
This is a tough question to answer. Some say objectivity is born after a person dies. It is true that death changes the light in which we see people. But up to what extent? Can mourning alternate realities? These are a few among the many questions I have asked myself after reading one book some time ago on this topic. The author brings this topic back into the limelight.Some people say it is better to speak about the positive sides of the dead person during the time of grief, but not focus on their negative facets as everybody also has a negative side to their personalities along with the positives. But what will we do if the person only has a negative side and the positive side is almost nil? I think it is better to remain silent than to focus on the negatives during mourning. These are the questions that we should contemplate a lot before answering. The answers to the above questions vary depending on the individual's personality and character.  “Why do we romanticize the dead? Why can't we be honest about them? Especially moms, they're the most romanticized of anyone. ”  
5) Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa 
Both anorexia and bulimia are eating disorders. In anorexia, people restrict their food intake to lose weight. In bulimia, people will eat an excessive amount of food in a short period of time and then purge them using various methods to prevent weight gain. Both these disorders will cause severe health problems. For example in bulimia due to repeated trauma to the esophagus due to vomiting gastric acidic contents, the person can develop esophageal adenocarcinoma. So, this is a serious medical problem that healthcare professionals should treat. ""Jennette, what you're describing is... really unhealthy. Your mother essentially condoned your anorexia, encouraged it. She... taught it to you. That's abuse.""  
6) Friendship. 
Building a good friendship takes a lot of time, effort, and sacrifice. We can see the author talking about friendships in this book. I remember reading about different types of friendship in a book.Friendships can be classified into three. -1) Friendship of pleasure - Friendship ends when the enjoyment and fun end.- 2) Friendship of convenience - Friendship ends when the convenience factor end.- 3) True friendship - Friendship based on mutual respect.The author mentions that she dislikes friendship of convenience. ""I don't like knowing people in the context of things. ""Oh, that's the person I work out with. That's the person I'm in a book club with. That's the person I did that show with."" Because once the context ends, so does the friendship.""  
7) What is the problem with comparing our life with that of successful people? 
In this age of social media, every one of us has a tendency to know more about the life of successful people from their social media profiles and compare our life with theirs. The biggest problem is that people only post the positive side of their lives on social media. So checking others' Instagram profiles and comparing our life to others can push us into anxiety and depression. In Jennette's case, she had Ariana Grande as the co-star in one of the shows, and she developed a habit of comparing her life with Ariane's. This is a habit we should never develop, and the author tells us all the troubles she had to face due to this behavior. ""The third is that Ariana is at the stage in her career where she's popping up on every 30 Under 30 list that exists. And I'm at the stage in my career where my team is excited that I'm the new face of Rebecca Bonbon, a tween clothing line featuring a cat with her tongue sticking out. Sold exclusively at Walmart. And I frequently make the mistake of comparing my career to Ariana's. I can't help it. I'm constantly in the same environment as her, and she doesn't exactly try to hide her successes.""   
My favourite three lines from this book 
 ""Suddenly, I feel just like that little eleven-year-old girl who was confused and scared and uncertain. That eleven-year-old girl who was doubtful that I knew the whole truth of my situation, who was unsure that my mother was the hero she pretended to be, but who shoved that doubt down.""   ""I don't like when grown-ups make faces or sounds that I don't understand. It's frustrating. It makes me feel like I'm missing something.”    ""And the kids who are annoying, don't take direction, ask questions—those are the kids who won't get sent out on auditions. The kids who will get auditions are the ones who shut up and do as they're told.""   
What could have been better?
The title of this book is a brutal one. I think Jennette should have given it a much more positive title. This current title will indeed pull the attention of many new readers to this book. But it also has its demerits. Whenever the author hears or sees the name of this book in the future, the first emotion that will come to her mind might be anger and sadness just because of this title. I can never tell that the author should have forgiven her mother as she had to suffer a lot due to her. But still, I think the title is brutal, and it should have been a different optimistic one.

It could have been edited better with how repetitive it is. It also has no self reflecting within the story, not that she isn’t a victim cuz she is. How she viewed other women and other women friendships also bothered me. I can see how coming from such a competitive career like acting could HAVE caused that but, I would HAVE loved to see some self-reflecting on that part as well."
23,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6431467-s-penkevich,Rating 4 out of 5,"**Winner of the 2022 Goodreads Choice Award for Memoirs!**Chances are, if you have a TikTok or Instagram you know what this book is. I mean, I'm Glad My Mom Died was on back order already the morning it was published and was a sought after title all August and is a book you just cannot avoid if you have an internet connection or local bookstore. Nor should you. Jennette McCurdy, the former iCarly actress, speaks so openly and candidly about a lifelong cycle of abuse and dependency with her mother (who passed in, as the title likely led you to assume), chronicling trauma and serious mental health struggles such as eating disorders that all were brought upon her through the need to serve her mother’s wishes. It’s one I’ve had right in everyone’s faces at the bookstore since we finally got copies, as the title is sure to solicit reactions and I privately enjoy seeing them, but also it is an important look at abuse and recovery. I had to finally read it. I mean we all deserve a Hot Girl Summer but can I truly say I had one if I didn’t read any Colleen Hoover, Beach Read or at least this, the most popular book of the end of summer? No. And I’m glad I did pick this up to read at work because this deserves all the hype and more, and I hope this is another success on McCurdy's road to improved mental health. While she loved her mother, their relationship was often abusive and left a lot to detangle in adulthood. Deeply personal and moving, this is a look into McCurdy's life as well as a necessary warning about the ways young girls are objectified, commodified and exploited, even by those closest to them.‘I realize that she’s happy and I’m not. Her happiness came at the cost of mine. I feel robbed and exploited.’That line says it all, honestly. This is an upsetting account of McCurdy's life, and one where all the warning signs were out in the open and ignored. Especially by Nickelodeon who don’t exactly come across well here. We’ve heard horror stories about the treatment of child actors for as long as there have been child actors, though this isn’t simply another case file of grievances but a really heartfelt self-examination and testimony. McCurdy comes across as very open and honest, and it really paints a positive look at her as a person who has gone through so much. There are times when she discusses the anger she felt, which feels justified and as Soraya Chemaly talks about in the book Rage Becomes Her: The Power of Women's Anger, sometimes anger is the appropriate response in order to not be silenced or ignored. It can be an important tool, or an armor as McCurdy describes: ‘I became an angry person with no tolerance for anyone. I'm aware of this shift and yet have no desire to change it. If anything, I want it. It's armor. It's easier to be angry than to feel to pain underneath it.’She also expresses feelings of regret for having lashed out in these times, looking at how abuse shouldn’t just beget another cycle of abuse, and these discussions seem to come from a place of maturity and healing. It is likely very encouraging and empowering for victims of abuse to read much of this book, though heads up, it does get into some very triggering situations and topics.‘Mom only sits in when I’m being the thing she wanted to be.’McCurdy shows how so much of her life was lived to be what her mother wanted, and much of this became painful. She was raised in a Mormon household and was homeschooled by her mother, a mom who wanted to always present a perfect image and often lashed out hurtfully. In short, McCurdy is open about her mom having narcissistic tendencies, and while she is still caring for her mother (she does make it clear she very much loved her mother), the scars are quickly apparent. From years of life like this, McCurdy felt she lacked an authentic self, and this carried over into struggles with body image from seeing one’s own self as an object that serves others instead of something personally only yours. This is a major theme in the essays in My Body by Emily Ratajkowski for those looking for further reading on the subject. When fearing her breasts would grow during puberty, the mother encouraged extreme calorie reduction and dangerous dieting practices. While discussions of the mother bookend this memoir, the bulk of the middle portion is about eating disorders. Most tragic is the moment in the hospital with her siblings saying goodbye to her mother when she says the one thing she thinks could actually make her mother proud of her: ‘I'm in the ICU with my dying mother, and the thing that I'm sure will get her to wake up, is the fact that in the days since mom has been hospitalized, my fear and sadness have morphed into the perfect anorexia motivation cocktail, and finally I have achieved mom's current goal weight for me: 89 pounds.’There is a lot to be said about the ways this reflects a general attitude around young women and girls, especially in the entertainment industry and how it robs them of their own agency. ‘I was conditioned to believe any boundary I wanted was a betrayal of her, so I stayed silent,’ she writes, and in this we see how these systems perpetuate themselves: silence. Young women and girls are broken down to believe they are in service to another (we could get into a long discussion on how this is the social framing inflicted by the intersections of misogyny and capitalism) and silence is induced by making them first feel they wouldn’t be believed or listened to but also that they deserve it, it’s for their own good or that they don’t even have the agency to speak out. It is truly tragic how often victims of abuse are silenced when they do speak out, which is another tool in oppression.So this book is a lot, but it is also very good and seems very healing. I was under the impression based on how it was presented and marketed that this was more of a comedic memoir, so heads up if that was what you assumed as well, but the weight and power of her words as she discusses a lifetime of abuse is definitely worth reading for. It does read very plainly, almost like a “class assignment” type of tone recounting events, though they are certainly difficult memories to have to revisit. I hope McCurdy is doing well, and it is very honorable of her to use her experience to reach out and help others in this way. There could have been more depth to some of it, but this is less a look at the causes and social critiques and more at the personal effects she endured. There are great reminders too about how to move forward and not get bogged down in being perfect, such as when she writes that ‘slips are totally normal. When you have a slip, it’s just that. A slip. It doesn’t define you. It doesn’t make you a failure. The most important thing is that you don’t let that slip become a slide‘. I won’t get too much more into it, as you should probably read the book and this is McCurdy's story to tell, but I am very glad I read this.'My mom didn't get better. But I will.'"

27,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62684711-beatrice,Rating 1 out of 5,"Memoirs should be one’s reflection about one’s past, otherwise is just a journaling exercise. This whole book felt juvenile, repetitive and under-edited. The dialogues were weird and unbelievable because they totally lacked context (and before someone misinterprets my words, I am not saying that I don’t believe Jennette words, but that simply writing down her abusive mother’s worst moments is cathartic, yes, but it’s not in any way compelling to read, because there is no built-up, no tension, just straight up abuse). The inexplicable decision of using a present tense killed every chance of expressing self-awareness, self-reflection and healing, and the book felt like a journaling therapy exercise. It didn’t help the fact that writing the memoir focusing on traumas and single events, each one of them taking up one short chapter, made the “narration” very disjointed.The blurb is also very unfaithful to the actual content of the book: this memoir was described as “heartbreaking” and “hilarious”, and I have my doubts about the latter. I smiled twice, in the space of 92 chapters.As a person who has a strained relationship with her mentally-ill mother, I am proud of Jennette for being able to tell her story, but unfortunately her memoir fell short, for me."
28,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56229062-letitia-bookshelfbyla,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow. A very revealing and honest memoir. Unsure what parts people found funny. I didn’t laugh once and didn’t see any parts that were structured for humor. Nickelodeon and Disney was a huge part of my childhood and I loved iCarly and loved Sam. Hearing Jennette’s story is another example of how you don’t know what’s happening to someone behind closed doors. As talented as she was in acting, I’m glad she made the decision to walk away. No one should be forced into a career they never wanted - especially a career as draining and consuming emotionally, mentally and physically as acting. Her mother’s abuse was tough to hear. It’s more painful to see how much Jennette wanted to appease her mom all the way until the very end of her life. She consistently put her mom’s needs before her own and her mom would willingly exploit and manipulate her knowing this. The title and cover is alarming and provocative but justified. If you assume Jennette never loved her mother, the story proves the exact opposite. The title is not a reflection of Jennette but the treatment of her mother towards her. Her mother severely betrayed and abused her and Jennette loved her while she was alive despite it. But time and healing allowed her to see the long term damage her mother has done and some damage is irreversible. Her story sheds more light to how we shouldn’t turn a blind eye to all the different forms, relationships and dynamics abuse can happen. If anything, parental abuse should be looked at with the utmost seriousness due to the power dynamic and pressures to love your family despite their faults, even when they hurt you. I could go on, but if any part of her story interests you, I would recommend reading. Major trigger warnings for abuse, eating disorders, bulimia, and anorexia. She is very blunt and candid about her life with eating disorders. Jennette from an early age wanted to write but her mom didn’t support her. I’m glad Jennette is finally able to do what she always wanted."

my blog review
TW: Anorexia, abuse (emotional, child), bulimia, cancer, eating disorders, drugs and alcohol abuse, death, grief, mental illness, manipulation, grooming.To me, reading and rating a memoir is something delicate, because that person is opening up about their experiences, their traumas, thoughts and emotions that are very private or painful sometimes.Wow, I have no words. I'm just proud of Jennette and wish for her the best because she deserves a good life, happiness and so much love.Must of us grew up watching Nickelodeon shows like iCarly, Drake & Josh, Big Time Rush, Zoey 101 and many more, laughing at many characters' jokes or actions, not knowing that perhaps some of those actors were having a really bad time.This memoir isn't about Jennette's days in Nickelodeon, yes, she talks about some of her struggles. This memoir is about her early years, before and getting in the entertainment industry, her teen years and early adulthood. It's really painful to read about Jennette's struggles with food. While on iCarly she (her character) was obsessed with food, Jennette was obsessed with it, too, but not in the same way. Her mother impossed onto her this unhealthy routine that developed in anorexia and years later in bulimia.This book is totally worth to read. And I totally loved it. Jennette is a wonderful story-teller, I liked the writing, that is so captivating and beautiful. I'm really proud of her and wish to her nothing but happiness."
30,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8114361-jesse-jessethereader,Rating 5 out of 5,This book was incredible. I can't imagine going through as much as Jennette McCurdy did and then having the courage to recount those hardships for all to read. I know this is a book that will stick with me and I'll continue to process the stories she shared within the book. 
31,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/105191338-kat-will-try-to-catch-up-soon,Rating 4 out of 5,"When my two kids were young, I used to watch iCarly with them every week. I'm actually not sure who enjoyed it more, me or them, to be honest! Anyone who watched the Nickelodeon show knows that Jennette McCurdy's character, Sam Puckett, wasn't one to mince words. Her sarcastic, jaded humor was one of the funniest aspects of the show, and I appreciated that she was a character without pretense - a ""what you see is what you get"" type.Fast forward ten years, and now Jennette McCurdy, unencumbered by a character she seems to wish she'd never had to embody, has written her own truth. It's raw, unfiltered and without pretense and possesses more than a little of that jaded humor, suggesting that maybe you can never fully escape who you are, even when you're acting.At its heart, this is a book about Jennette surviving the trauma of her mother Debra's abuse and the multitude of ways it impacted her sense of identity, mental health, coping mechanisms and life choices. It's about a girl who couldn't separate who she was from who her mother insisted she be. It's about a girl who lost the chance to follow her own dreams while her mother vicariously lived hers through her only daughter. It's about a mom using her survival against cancer and the family's Mormon faith to emotionally entrap and manipulate her daughter into behaving as she wished lest Jennette's 'disobedience' cause Debra's sickness to return. It's about a girl so enmeshed with her mother that even when she finally moved out into her first apartment, her mother used her illness as an excuse to move in with her.This isn't run-of-the-mill stage mom stuff. This is a vivid portrayal of the impact a narcissistic, manipulative parent can have on their child. It just so happens the person involved is famous. Jennette was pushed into a career she didn't want at six years old. She experienced extreme anxiety, OCD, panic attacks, codependency and sexual, verbal and emotional abuse at the hands of her mother. She experienced inappropriate overtures and manipulation at the hands of a Nickelodeon figure, simply named ""The Creator"" in the book, but undoubtedly Dan Schneider, who created iCarly. Perhaps worst of all, and this is something that many who experience trauma will understand, is what she suffered at her own hands trying to cope with the abuse. She developed anorexia, bulimia, alcoholism, questionable sexual relationships, anger issues, and deep-seated insecurity that continued well after Debra's eventual death.These are darker topics, but what Jennette did so well in this memoir is to lay things bare and be vulnerable with her pain while balancing it with her wit and humor. She takes you through her emotional journey and leaves you with the sense that, after much reflection and therapy, she'll be OK and that those experiencing similar things in their lives can be too. I listened to the audiobook read by the author herself, and it felt like an intimate conversation between her and her audience. It's very well written, and I have every confidence it's only the beginning of the writing career SHE wanted!★★★★"

I wish nothing but the best for her!! But also based off of her narration of her own life, I wonder if she is gay???? Sorry sorry I’m lesbian projecting maybe but like… anyways this peak into the horror and brutality of child stardom and Hollywood’s bullshit was so moving and insightful, and the shift from a childish voice and perspective at the beginning of the book as it progressed onward was well done I think. I feel like anyone who’s seen any episode of iCarly or any other Nickelodeon show should definitely read this…"

Admiro mucho el trabajo que hizo Jennette para escribir este libro, ya que se nota el trabajo de exploración para recordar las emociones que sintió desde que tenía 6 años, hasta las dificultades que tuvo que pasar para poder sanarlas. Es importante darle visibilidad a los trastornos alimenticios, ya que han sido una problemática por mucho tiempo y han causado estragos en millones de personas. Es bueno que ese haya sido el enfoque principal de estas páginas.

She now wants to Tour and Talk about it Non-Stop  Changed it To 1 Star. This is my First Time Ever Doing That, but just can not get on board with this Opportunist Jeannette who is not Healed at 30, Complains so Shy and Forced to Talk on iCarly because of mother, now she thinks she’s better~so she writes book with Mom and iCarly Splashed in Blurb and Tours Constantly Speaking and Complaining about these People. Read too many other books, never felt remotely like I do with this one  I really wasn’t interested in this audio 🎧 book. I thought the Title was ok since I was going to be reading Satire. I didn’t find anything funny about this one. It’s hard to put my finger on it exactly, but this one just doesn’t sit right. If you want out of a certain life, you leave, not throw up your name on a book with that title and it’s all about iCarly. She does Tours and Shows doing this. It just strikes me as ‘profound and honest’ is anything but, it’s just being A Mean Girl. You are upset with your mother and want out of acting, you don’t go on a tour and make money off this type of salacious book. She is not healed, she wants to attack her mother. If you are truly healed, you don’t want to do that and anger and hurt you work through and get a full complex understanding of yourself and the other person. You don’t go all over Social Media promoting yourself, remember you absolutely hate that, shy girl. I was really surprised when I read this author is 30 years old. With all the therapy she got, she doesn’t seem like she has much depth or much to say. Yes, I get it, it sounds like her mother was pushing her too hard into being a star. She pressured her about her weight. I am not suggesting this was wonderful parenting, but for a 30 year old who really doesn’t seem to do anything but blame her Mom for her problems, I just think she does not come across as an insightful person.She goes to great lengths to tell us about her vomit and chunks and all. Is that supposed to make me laugh? 20 minutes of hearing about your barf without making me feel an understanding of eating disorders. Notice she only speaks of hers, no deeper caring for others suffering from this. Her Mom died 8 years ago, so why exactly did she then continue to try and keep a career going since she hated it that much? So, ok you don’t enjoy acting and want to do something else. I don’t think many recovered people would invest their time in touring and writing a book that uses a Sensationalized Cover~Smiling and Holding an Urn, Discusses Endlessly All her Mom’s Problems and in the blurb, iCarly is Prominently Mentioned.  If it wasn’t she would get her dream, no one would have a clue who she is. She would be free to explore many avenues of her life that perhaps give her some joy. She would also have to see how she does using her own resources. She might succeed and she might fail, but that is living an adult life. Instead she doesn’t seem to understand that yes her mother had problems, but Jeannette does, too. Many, Currently. Do I care about her going to a party with her Life Coach and if she eats a Cookie or not. No. The audio book sounded flat, with no emotional gravity and it is unusual for me not to care about a person or difficulties they face. Yet, that is how I felt. Perhaps, because she does not sound authentic. She is still talking and acting like 16 year old Sam. Doing what she is currently doing comes across as an opportunist and well narcissistic. She whines continually, complains she never got a chance to do anything she was proud of. Yet, she was doing a Spin Off of iCarly’s Sam at 21 years old. Her mother had died. The show ended. So, why did she not get roles and the dream jobs she thinks she deserved? Her mother caused the problem? She was supposed to get her own show, something where she was the central focus. This she thinks sounds fantastic. Something she deserves. Netflix canceled her show. Perhaps, Jeannette many of the issues you encountered are about you. You need to accept some responsibility for your life and move away from making money off carrying on how awful your mother was. I certainly was put off by this and it doesn’t sound like much of a way to live. Actually, do something substantial and that has an impact for you and others."

CW: eating disordersI never watched iCarly or Sam and Cat, but I’ve known of Jeanette. I’m sure everyone is reading this for the same reason I did: the title. I’m sure it was cathartic to write this but I guess also really hard. Her relationship with her mom was so toxic. Being forced into acting, carrying the financial burden of the family, and struggles with eating disorders and body image. Wow. There were bits of humor in her writing that definitely helped to lighten the mood during some tough bits. I think this memoir was really open and honest. Because let’s be real, everybody memoir ain’t good or doesn’t feel honest. I appreciate she acknowledged certain privileges she had while talking about the negative effects of it all. Anyway, go read it. I think it’s good to see the behind the scenes of a child actor, especially a young girl and all the pressures they deal with. I hope Jeanette is thriving today, she deserves it.

“Why do we romanticize the dead? Why can't we be honest about them? Especially moms. They're the most romanticized of anyone.”

Honestly I’m not really sure why this is advertised as being “a heartbreaking and hilarious memoir.” Your girl did not laugh a single time. And I find everything funny. This was just incredibly dark and depressing. But that could just be me I guess. 
“I’m allowed to hate someone else’s dream, even if it’s my reality.”
Jennette McCurdy grew up with an abusive, manipulative, narcissistic mother and it took her a long time to unpack the trauma she was left with after she was gone. Her complicated feelings towards her mother were understandable but really upsetting to hear about. She gets thrown into the industry as a child by her mother who controls everything in her life, and Jennette doesn't realize how unhealthy her relationship with her mother is for a long time.
“I'm becoming an angry person with no tolerance for anyone. I'm aware of this shift and yet have no desire to change it. If anything, I want it. It's armor. It's easier to be angry than to feel the pain underneath it.”
It’s really sad to find out that someone who brought so much joy and happiness to our screens when we were kids was going through something so heartbreaking behind the scenes. Her mother was an awful person who did horrible things to her children and I’m so glad Jennette got the help she needed after that monster died. She’s such a strong and inspirational woman to be able to write this memoir, relive that experience and embark on her healing journey. 

“So much of my life felt so out of control for so long. And I’m done with that being my reality. I want my life to be in my hands. Not an eating disorder’s or a casting director’s or an agent’s or my mom’s. Mine.”

Now a Goodreads Choice Nominee in Memoir & Autobiography!!
This was the celebrity memoir that I did not anticipate being so genuinely excited to read. And yet in the lead up to publication, you could feel the palpable excitement surrounding it. Those who hadn’t heard of McCurdy before this were understandably confused; who is this Nikelodeon girl that’s caused a run on bookstores, selling out everywhere in less than a day? So that ended up being part of the appeal, the surge of excitement and hype that feels like it came out of nowhere. But that’s not all that was at play with I’m Glad My Mom died, as evident by that jarringly brilliant title. Coupled with the cover design, photography (A PINK URN) and style choices, McCurdy’s print debut would have turned heads regardless of the content. Though the contents themselves, adapted from her one-woman show that was unable to tour last year due to the pandemic, are told with a raw candor that’s completely captured readers and made it a roaring success. Jennette McCurdy has in a sense created the perfect storm—name recognition among younger millennials and older zoomers, a story centered around an abusive parent and the predatory entertainment industry, and coming out soon enough after to feel fresh while also allowing dust to settle.Even a few years ago, I don’t think the public would have been nearly as receptive to her testimony. And there are still a number of people who are going to take offense to not just the phrasing of the title, but the entire premise behind it, which is that many times it’s those the closest to you who cause the most harm. In my experience, people with healthy, or what they believe to be healthy, relationships with their immediate family members have a hard time conceptualizing how anyone could want or need to cut relatives off completely. It’s much more comforting to stick to the belief that familial love is inherent, and so they push back against the idea that sometimes it needs to be earned. This is even more true when the cycle of abuse is generational, as in Jennette’s case, and that standard has become foundational for the rest of your relationships. For that reason, I interpreted “I’m Glad My Mom Died” not as Jennette wishing death on her mother, but as an expression of relief. Based on the trajectory her mother set, there’s little doubt that Jennette’s story would have ended in tragedy, if not her own death. And prior to her mom’s decline, there wasn’t much to suggest that Jennette would have been able to wriggle out from under her thumb on her own. So much of Jennette’s life has been lived in the spotlight, and anyone who’s looking to pick up this book for a kind of True Hollywood Story will get pieces of that as well. There’s all the moments leading up to Jennette’s ‘big break’ on iCarly, some of her time on Nickelodeon, unsettling interactions with disgraced producer Dan Schneider, but McCurdy’s real reckoning is much more internal. Her struggle to reconstruct her identity after she no longer had her mother or a TV network dictating who she needed to be is long and arduous. There’s backslides and missteps and a lot of pain that’s still trying to scab over. But though Jennette’s journey is far from complete, her book ends with hope, and its commercial success leaves her in an advantageous position. I’m not sure what her next career move is going to be, but at least going forward there’s no question of who will be in the driver’s seat. And to those complaining that it wasn’t funny enough: sorry that abuse doesn’t always come with a punchline. I’m sure she’ll keep that in mind for the sequel. *Thanks to Simon & Schuster for getting me this book the week it came out! It was legitimately sold out everywhere. **For more book talk & reviews, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!"
41,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61034409-kory,Rating 3 out of 5,"super honest and raw. i’m glad she’s been able to tell her story and get to a healthier place.just a warning: despite the cover and synopsis saying it’s hilarious, this memoir is super heavy from beginning to end, so don’t go into it expecting light and humor.content/trigger warnings; domestic abuse, child abuse (emotional, psychological, physical/sexual), queerphobia, ableism, r slur, fatphobia, OCD, eating disorder (food restriction, binging, purging, over-exercising), sex, breast cancer, cancer related death of mother, slut shaming, internalized misogyny, alcoholism,i will say though that i don’t care for how it’s written. memoirs written from the perspective of the author at various ages don’t work for me. there’s always a disconnect. i can’t help but think “how do you remember this” when reading super detailed stories and full-on conversations and exact thoughts, especially if they’re writing from the perspective of them as a child. i prefer the approach to memoirs where the author gives their current perspective on their past experiences.i feel the need to address the people angry about the title. jennette has said if her mother were still alive, she never would’ve written the book, which she said was a healing process, because she’d still be under her mother’s control because she knows her mother would never change (she acknowledges the idea that if her mother were alive, she’d apologize and change and they’d start fresh is just another way of romanticizing the dead). why do you have a problem with her being glad she is finally free and healthy?(note: narcissist is not a synonym for abuser. her mother was not diagnosed and it is no one’s place to decide that just because she was abusive and manipulative. think about the implications and stigmatization of equating npd to abuse, especially when people with npd are more likely to be victims of abuse than perpetrators.)(just an annoyance of mine: why do so many people say “i feel weird rating someone’s life”? you’re not rating their life or experiences, you’re rating their book. y’all act like rating a memoir is the equivalent of saying “i’d give that a 3.5” to someone’s face after they shared a deeply personal story with you. it’s a book made for people to consume and get something out of, and with reading books comes reviewing/rating them. it’s not weird.)"

I wanted to see what all the fuss was about surrounding Jennette McCurdy’s memoir, I’m Glad My Mom Died, so I downloaded the audiobook from my library.And I have to say, what she reveals in the memoir is as provocative and jaw-dropping as the title. Her stories back up the shock value. The extent of the abuse she suffered at the hands of her narcissistic mother is disturbing, and it’s no surprise McCurdy has been riddled with anxiety, addiction, and eating disorders. (Yes, plural. Both anorexia and bulimia.) Her mother controlled every aspect of her life, teaching her things no mother should ever teach her child.The good news is, McCurdy is in recovery and finally seems to be living the life she wants. I’m happy for her, and is it odd to say, even proud of her?!?! I’m Glad My Mom Died is as raw and revealing as memoirs can be. The honesty with which McCurdy tells her story is admirable – not many of us could’ve done it.I can see why Jennette is glad her mom died. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t glad, too. At least a little bit."

46,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27544898-bookishrealm,No Rating,"This is going to be an interesting review for me because I know how much people have adored this book. It's taken some time for me to get my thoughts together and really figure out what I wanted to say. I will not be rating this book because I don't necessarily feel like it's my place to give this a star rating especially since it is McCurdy's experience and it isn't a five-star review from me. Please note that this book has a lot of content warnings including sexual abuse, emotional abuse, gas lighting, r-slur, ableism, and eating disorders.I'm Glad My Mom Died has been getting all of the media attention prior to and during its release. With such a catchy title and such a prominent figure from the Nickelodeon show ICarly, it's no surprise that people were going to gravitate towards this book. McCurdy explores her experience dealing with a toxic, abusive, narcissist mother who thrust her into a career in which she had no interest. The book is often hard to read as McCurdy goes into dark details that she experienced at the hands of her mother and the industry. This abuse had long lasting effects that continued to impact the star long after her mother's passing. What I enjoyed, and I use that word lightly, the most about this memoir was McCurdy's reiteration that motherhood in itself is not deserving of a pedestal or award. The act of birthing a child is not the equivalent of being a good mother or even an adequate mother. There is so much work that goes into it and doing the basics of taking care of and nurturing a child does not warrant the receiving of a gold star. McCurdy admired her mother and unfortunately suffered at the hands of someone who was supposed to care for, love her, and build her up. Instead she was broken down and given an altered, toxic perspective of herself that ultimately continues to impact her to this day. I admire and respect McCurdy for letting readers into such a personal, heart wrenching lived experience.With that being said, I don't feel as though I'm Glad My Mom Died is the best written celebrity memoir out there. Please keep in mind that I'm not criticizing her experience, but the actual structure and cohesiveness of the story. I've read quite a few celebrity memoirs this year alone and have come across several that were better written than this. It has made me question the hype surrounding this title as opposed to other memoirs and I can't help but to think that the title, the popularity surrounding ICarly, and the actual person telling the story play a role into it. McCurdy is not the first celebrity that has shared the extreme abuse suffered at the hands of parental figures and Hollywood, and unfortunately she won't be the last as many become more comfortable sharing their stories. This doesn't mean that McCurdy should not get all the praise in the world for having the courage to share such a traumatic personal experience. I can't begin to imagine how much it took to have to relieve those traumatic experiences over and over again to get her thoughts down on paper. Nevertheless, I won't treat it as if it's the best memoir that I've encountered. As a reader and reviewer, I tend to look at a book from a variety of angles and the structure of this narrative didn't always work for me. It was clinical in some ways which definitely could have been a result of McCurdy attempting to distance herself from her trauma, but I felt it took away from the emotional impact some readers may have been anticipating. Overall, I think that this book will continue to gain traction amongst readers and may even have a certain appeal to those that don't typically read non-fiction. I hope that this writing experience was cathartic for McCurdy and that eventually she finds the peace that she so desperately needed all this time."
47,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9429655-luce-cry-baby,Rating 4 out of 5,"❀ blog ❀ thestorygraph ❀ letterboxd ❀  tumblr ❀ ko-fi ❀ If you are boo-booing this book just because of its title...kindly f*ck off. It is intentionally provocative and I am here for it. To place ‘the mother’ figure on a pedestal is ultimately detrimental to mothers since by idealizing them we cease to see them as real flawed human beings.  I'm Glad My Mom Died is a brutally honest memoir recounting Jennette McCurdy’s abusive relationship with her narcissistic mother, her disturbing experiences as a child actor and the unsettling realities of the entertainment industry, and her long battle with various eating disorders and self-destructive behaviors. I won’t lie, there were many scenes and passages that were very triggering but these never came across as gratuitous or sensationalistic. This is very much thanks to McCurdy’s clear-cut prose, which renders things with clarity and avoids sentimental and moralistic pitfalls. McCurdy’s unadorned style really reflects her younger perspective, as she details the psychological, verbal, and emotional abuse she experienced with a child’s ‘limited’ understanding of those things. As a child McCurdy was unable to identify or articulate the myriad of ways in which she was being abused by the adults around her, specifically her mother, and McCurdy remains faithful to her child’s pov. This is a tricky stylistic choice as I have come across memoirs where I found this re-identification with a younger version of yourself to be gimmicky, contrived, and not at all convincing (like when 30yr-olds actors play teens). Here instead it felt very authentic and effective as it brings home a child’s limited understanding of the abuse they are experiencing (that it wouldn’t occur to them to call it as such, that for them this is the ‘norm’, that they are somehow at fault).Growing up with a narcissist parent (although i must point out that my parent was more of the child-like-emotionally-immature variety) can truly warp your view of the world and your self-perception. Rather than looking back to the past with an adult understanding of this, McCurdy drops us right into the thick of things, so that it felt less like an act of retrospection than a reliving of her childhood.McCurdy was raised in a Mormon family and was homeschooled by her mother Debra, who is prone to fits of rage and hysteria (i use this word in a non-gender-specific way).We witness how controlling and manipulative Debra is, specifically with her daughter. From horrific violations of privacy—Debra carries out body inspections and insists on showering McCurdy well into her late teens—to food policing—instilling and later on enabling McCurdy’s eating disorder—Debra constantly infantilizes and guilt-trips her daughter (using her cancer to win arguments or other people’s sympathy). To placate Debra’s volatility McCurdy would always acquiesce, doing whatever her mother demanded of her in order to please her. We see that this was how Debra is able to push McCurdy into a child acting career, placing her in numerous objectionable situations and putting her under an undue amount of stress by making her the ‘breadwinner’ of the family. As the years go by we see just how deeply this abuse is affecting McCurdy. Her eating disorder soon dominates her life, exacerbating her self-loathing. When McCurdy eventually hits the ‘jackpot’ with i-Carly her fame doesn’t appease Debra, who always demands more of her daughter. We learn more about the entertainment industry, in particular how it exploits children. From the unsafe working environments to the relentless work schedules (interviews, promos, etc.) and the casting process…McCurdy peels the curtain and allows us an unsavory view of what goes on behind the scenes of children shows. McCurdy details the abusive behavior of ‘the Creator’, the director of i-Carly, on and off set as well as the overwhelming realities of being a public figure at such a young age. As her abusive relationship with Debra contaminates every aspect of her life, McCurdy, who has yet to reconcile herself with the f*cked up nature of her mother’s parenting, turns to her eating disorder as a source of (misplaced) ‘comfort’. As her years of disordered eating begin to take a toll on her, McCurdy eventually turns to alcohol and becomes involved in some rather toxic romantic/sexual relationships (one of whom was quite a bit older...schifo). Debra’s cancer eventually leads to her being hospitalized yet again and eventually to her death. After her latest show is shut-down due to the Creator’s behavior, a grieving and confused McCurdy distances herself from the entertainment industry. In the subsequent years, McCurdy seeks professional help, which ultimately results in her gaining a new understanding of Debra (that she wasn’t ‘merely’ overbearing). McCurdy is unsparing in detailing her various eds. Much of what she wrote about her warped relationship with food and her body (she wants to prevent her body from hitting puberty to appease her mother) was truly hard to read about. This is not only because she is brutally frank, but because I had an ed (i’m afraid that i am of the belief that eds, like most addictions really, never really ‘go away’). So yes. I had a hard time with a lot of the content of this book. Thankfully, because McCurdy’s writing is very matter-of-fact I was able to push through my discomfort but if you also have experiences with eds and you are still in a vulnerable place, I recommend you put this memoir on the back burner. Like I said earlier, I appreciated how nonjudgmental and unsentimental McCurdy is. She doesn’t vilify her mother, even if she would have every right to do so, nor does she take the opportunity to blame other family members (i did question how aware mccurdy’s dad was of Debra’s emotional incest: i know narcissistic parents can be quite covert and that they usually tend to parent their children differently but i still wanted to know more about his role in all of this).I know I am making it sound like a bleak-fest, and, well, that’s because it is in fact a depressing read. That title and the cover belie the memoir’s sobering tone. McCurdy does now and again lighten things up, by giving page-time to her friendship with Miranda Cosgrove, her i-Carly co-star, and later on, her mordant humor injects much-needed levity into her experiences. I'm Glad My Mom Died was truly a heart-wrenching read. McCurdy’s voice was as compelling as it was perceptive, and I appreciated just how candid she is. She doesn't portray herself as flawless, nor is she seeking our pity. Hopefully, the people who read this will be able to empathize with her, without focusing only on the ‘juicy’ bits involving her acting career (i have already come across several articles misrepresenting McCurdy’s words and pitying her against Grande…can we as a society move past this need to pit women against each other?).Within this memoir, McCurdy presents us with hard-hitting depictions of abuse, trauma, grief, and eating disorders. My heart really went out to her and I found her voice to be truly captivating. I won't forget about this memoir any time soon, and I look forward to reading or seeing what McCurdy will do in the future as she is a truly talented writer. If you happen to be a fans of memoirs such as Michelle Zauner's Crying in H Mart, T Kira Madden's Long Live the Tribe of Fatherless Girls, & Lily Allen's My Thoughts Exactly, chances are I'm Glad My Mom Died will be right up your sleeve so do check it out."
48,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,Rating 4 out of 5,"So many great things about this book. I really liked Jennette McCurdy’s writing style – very show and not tell, focusing on specific scenes and moments from her childhood. She vividly captures her mother’s codependency on her, her encouragement of disordered eating behaviors, and her emotional instability. I think it’s courageous of McCurdy to tell the truth about her mother’s abuse given how as a society we often valorize mothers/the nuclear family. I also enjoyed and appreciated McCurdy writing about her experiences of therapy later on in her life. She has one therapy stint in which she’s not ready to confront the fact of her mother’s abuse. Later on, she’s able to heal through working on her eating disorder recovery with a different therapist and quitting acting altogether. I think McCurdy’s celebrity, the memoir’s catchy title, and the overall quality of writing have helped make I’m Glad My Mom Died a success. I hope that we can also pay attention to writers of color who have written about their experiences of abuse and recovery, such as Stephanie Foo’s memoir

I'd always watch Drake & Josh, iCarly, Victorious, Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide & Big Time Rush (just to name a few of my faves). Took me a while to realize but obviously the reality for child/teen actors back then was a lot different than what I imagined. Just like a lot of people, I know Jennette as Sam Puckett, the food-loving, tough, no-nonsense sidekick in iCarly. Never in a million years would I have thought the actress behind the beloved character was facing all these challenges, abuse and struggles with food in her real life.How messed up is it that a mother can do all these things to their own child? Jennette's mother was sick mentally (and physically due to cancer), thinking she's helping her daughter and 'knowing what's best for her'. I'm just so appalled at all the situations and emotional manipulation that she put Jennette through and how no one around Jennette gave her help or support until much later. Not to mention, Nickelodeon giving her hush money to keep quiet about the working conditions? Wtf. And the asshole Creator aka Dan fucking Schneider? It baffles me how the hell he got away with so much for so long.It was so hard reading about the eating disorders, fatphobia and body dysmorphia that was so ingrained in Jennette from such a young age. This book will resonate with me for a long time and I'm glad she got her story out. For what it's worth, I hope she's somewhat happy and at peace now."

It was also very eye opening to read about how dysfunctional the entertainment industry can be and the different abuses that surround it. It really puts a new perspective on the glitz and glam and how things appear at face value. I think she tackled very difficult topics with ease and I really appreciated the raw honesty of her words.

If my weight isn't enough to get Mom to wake up, then nothing will be. And if nothing can wake her up, then that means she's really going to die. And if she's really going to die, what am I supposed to do with myself? My life purpose has always been to make Mom happy, to be who she wants me to be. So without Mom, who am I supposed to be now?
iCarly was such a big part of my childhood, but I’ll never see the show with the same eyes again, because the audacity of the producer to make Jennette portray a character that is obsessed with food while she is anorexic? Get that genetically challenged man (a.k.a Dan Schneider) in JAIL but asap!! When I saw the title of this memoir, I knew I had to read this, because it was BOLD and I loved it. And surely, Jennette’s mother will not be missed. I’m just glad Jennette finally got to a place where she is feeling healthy, knows what she wants and could find her own voice.

Admiro muchísimo el valor de esta mujer de compartir sus vivencias y de hablar abiertamente de la relación tan dolorosa con su madre, pero no solo de eso, también de su relación con la comida/cuerpo, el alcohol, un productor abusivo e incluso con una pareja codependiente. A pesar de lo que pueda sugerir el título, este no es un libro que se sienta escrito con odio, ni con resentimiento, sino más bien como parte de un proceso de sanación. Quizá suene trillado decir que no porque alguien parezca tenerlo todo, eso significa que sea feliz pero esa es una de las grandes lecciones de esta historia. La fuerza para reconocer que tu madre fue abusiva y que la carrera que se te impuso fue un sueño ajeno, es algo admirable. Por otro lado, la verdadera realización viene cuando te deshaces de las expectativas ajenas. Muchas personas mantienen el mismo rumbo por miedo al cambio, aunque eso signifique vivir una vida infeliz. Jennette decidió cortar de tajo con eso y ojalá que le vaya muy bien en lo que sea que venga para ella."

I grew up watching Jennette on iCarly—phased out around her Sam & Cat days, but I have followed her story personally since she left acting and was briefly aware of her childhood abuse. Reading this memoir has given me a newfound respect for this woman. Jennette deserves the world.I'm Glad My Mom Died follows the in-depth and graphic life of Jennette from before the entertainment industry and after—all the way to the talks about writing this book. It delves into her family dynamic, her very toxic and abusive relationship with her mother, and every interaction behind the scenes of her struggle. Trying to please her mother and her work, using substances to stay numb, unhealthy routines, and almost never doing anything out of personal want for herself.Everything is written in the present tense. It feels as though we are right there with Jennette at whatever age she was at that moment. This is incredibly well written and filled to the brim with nuance. As a reader, we really could see how much Jennette grew over the years. She was not well informed about adulthood, a late bloomer but only due to the suffocation and manipulation of her mother. I just kept thinking back to how when I was younger than she was, watching her on my tv screen knowing about things she never knew or experienced until much later in life.Most of us know her as ""Sam Puckett"", the butter sock flinging witty wonder obsessed with food. Jennette was, however, obsessed with food in the opposite way. One of her biggest struggles was with food. Learning to count calories and undereat at a very young age which then turned to bulimia later in her young adult years. We take the journey with her in realizing how detrimental this was to her health and every mistake and heartache this caused.This book is not about her days on Nickelodeon. And if that is something you are looking for, you won't find it here, this book is not that. iCarly, Sam & Cat, her co-stars, and others are mentioned when it is relevant to her struggles and dilemmas. I am incredibly happy and proud of this woman. She is captivating, funny, and oh so deserving of a happy and painless life. This book is going to be one of my most recommended books."

Son dos cosas que definirían muy bien lo que sufrió Jennette McCurdy.TW: dependencia y codependencia, trastornos alimenticios, abuso físico, psicológico y emocional, abuso sexual, alcoholismo, relaciones enfermizas y tóxicas.No crecí con Jennette ni con ninguna otra figura dentro del mundo de Nickelodeon o Disney, pero apenas vi este libro y a ella como titular en todos lados me dije que debía leerlo. Al principio, fue por puro chismorreo debo aceptarlo o por lo que sea que siempre genera saber algo sobre la vida de un famoso. Pero luego, cuando lees una historia tan real; que sucede de manera universal solo te puede generar muchísima empatía y dices: que valiente es para contar su vida personal y profesional de esa manera. Esto va de Jennette y su madre principalmente, pero también de ella y su relación con su carrera de actriz y la fama que conlleva. Para empezar, conocemos más sobre su vida personal con alguien tan importante como lo fue su madre. Una mujer posiblemente bipolar, muy violenta, narcisista, controladora y manipuladora en exceso. Una madre que intentó moldear a su hija y lo logró, pero que encima de eso trató de hacerla dependiente en su totalidad y terminó volviéndola extremadamente codependiente. Definitivamente su madre le generó un extremo de complacencia hacia los demás, pero sobretodo dirigido a la figura materna. Y por si fuera poco, le ocasionó una serie de trastornos y vicios directa e indirectamente, entre esos TOC, anorexia, bulimia y alcoholismo.Una infancia arruinada por las responsabilidades que Jennette debía tomar como si fuera una adulta al entero cuidado de toda su familia. Una base cimentada en sus propias metas y propósitos aplastados por los de su madre, cargando las expectativas y los sueños de otro, cumpliéndolas a rajatabla para poder hacer sentir bien, feliz y completa a una mujer que prácticamente abusó de ella física, psicológica y emocionalmente. Luego, hay otro enfoque sobre su vida profesional, los compañeros de trabajo y el famoso creador de la serie que no dista de ser igual o peor que Debra McCurdy. Un ambiente tenso, manipulador y abusivo también.Jennette le dio voz a esa niña que no pudo hacerlo por culpa, por presión y por miedo a las consecuencias. La fama, la carrera de actriz, los lujos, todo eso solo fue algo que provino de su propia madre y en consecuencia esa misma fama le dio estrés, ansiedad y mucha infelicidad ante el hecho de fingir que todo estaba bien. Su vida desmoronándose con espectadores que la deshumanizaban y ella, allí, siempre sonriente. Una identidad basada en los deseos de su madre y en los papeles que interpretó para sus personajes.Personalmente a mí lo que más me dolió de este libro es que al principio Jennette ama a su madre, esa falsa idealización que se hace sin saber el abuso infantil que representa. Así es como hace todo lo posible porque Debra sea feliz. Luego de su muerte es cuando descubre de manera mucho más consciente hasta dónde ha llegado la influencia de su madre y todo lo que ha causado en ella. Un daño que si bien no es irreparable la marca para toda la vida.Que bien por Jennette por escribir esto. Primero, porque visibiliza un caso real y que es universal con todos los temas, trastornos y abusos físicos y emocionales que presenta. Y segundo, porque es obvio que este libro ha sido todo una catarsis para poder ir sanando heridas que quedaron luego de esas malas experiencias en la infancia, adolescencia y juventud. Sin conocerla y sin crecer con su figura en la televisión, me alegra de verdad que al fin pueda ser ella y no lo que su madre le impuso. El último capítulo se siente tan reparador que solo me pude alegrar por la manera en que cierra su historia y la terrible relación con su madre y el mundo del espectáculo."
59,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/78231074-baba-yaga-reads,Rating 3 out of 5,"I reached the end of this book feeling dirty on the inside. Never in my life have I read something so close to pure, unadultered trauma porn.The further I got into Jennette McCurdy’s memoir, the more I questioned her decision to publish it—or rather, the forces at play behind her decision to publish it. With every new detail about her abusive family, miserable acting career, and depressing love life, my queasiness grew. I couldn’t put the book down, not because I enjoyed her writing, but purely out of morbid curiosity for what she would reveal next.Maybe I should just accept that McCurdy is a grown woman who can freely decide what she wants to share with the public. Still, reading her memoir made me all too aware of the fact that this woman was brought up to be a relentless people pleaser, an emotionally neglected validation seeker who craved nothing more than praise and acceptance.And there is nothing our current cultural climate praises more than the public sharing of personal trauma.In the eyes of society, trauma grants you victimhood, and victimhood grants you sympathy, support, visibility. The closer you are to a perfect, blameless victim, the louder the support is. To me, it’s incredibly obvious that this book was written to incite sympathy and pity in the audience. Its 320 pages contain little to no self-reflection or personal thoughts; instead, what we get is an endless list of increasingly horrifying episodes from the author’s life. McCurdy lays herself bare in every sense of the word: we learn all kinds of graphic details about her eating disorders, sexual encounters, and relationship with her (incredibly invasive and inappropriate) mother. This felt like reading someone’s emails to their therapist; not in a good way, but in a why-are-you-telling-this-to-millions-of-strangers way. It’s clear that McCurdy is deeply, and rightfully, angry at what has been done to her. She’s mad at the adults who failed her, and wants to be recognized as a victim by the public at large. What I’m wondering is: is writing, and publishing, an autobiography really the best way to process your very private, personal trauma?I hope, for Jennette’s sake, that the answer is yes. I hope she never lives to regret feeding her most traumatic, shameful memories to the shark that is the public eye."
60,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53067896-amina,Rating 3 out of 5,"I felt a certain amount of internal pressure to jump on the literary bandwagon, and pick up I'm Glad My Mom Died. My biggest hesitation was the title and cover. I liked neither. I had no idea who Jennette McCurdy was, until I found out there was an iCarly connection. Over the years, my kids have watched re-runs, and I vaguely remember McCurdy--a little blonde girl.This is a traumatic, dark, complex memoir about an ex-child actress forced into the industry by her mother, who had broken aspirations of being an actress herself. Some of the things that were done to her were hard to digest. Mainly, the emphasis on body image that later caused anorexia and bulimia. The book summary says there is humor. There wasn't one moment I found myself laughing. The topics are hard to digest at their base; impossible to make light. The writing was sharp, clean, and to the point. I loved the first half. The second part, focused heavily on her eating disorder and her career. It also became more crass in language, which was probably done to show growth.  I wondered if McCurdy ended up liking acting, wanted to get a role more impressive, or always hated it. It was hard to tell. What seems to be true from this memoir, most child actors are treated with little respect. I lost my father to cancer, and recently my brother-in-law. It was triggering the way cancer was presented in the book. Most people have complicated relationships, whether it is with their parents, siblings or friends. Cancer, changes people in unimaginable ways.I wondered, when she talks about her mother's abusive language, (which she said she hardly used) was it a part of her disease--the personality changes that come with losing your hair, weight, and your ability to live independently. It's clear the mother had a plethora of mental health issues that stemmed from a mother who was abusive to her. In no way am I condoning the mother's behavior, but healing has many forms. Sometimes, it comes with acceptance of the other person's incapacities-- and wondering what they did right, especially in a time of terminal illness when forgiveness and expectance are healing for everyone. At the end of the memoir, McCurdy makes assumptions on what her mother's personality would be like today. I think what the mother did to her before her death remains awful, but parent-child relationships are complicated. There may have been apologizes or redemption. All humans have the adaptability and potential to recognize their flaws. I wonder, as an adult, how clearly the lines of abuse and love are defined by a child. Why do we romanticize the dead? Why can't we be honest about them? Especially moms.The above quote reminds me that WE DON'T have to romanticize the dead, but we also DON'T have to vilify them in a form of a book. Often, in psychological cases, it's somewhere in the middle. Not every child breaks ties, hates, or wishes their parents dead. It's impossible to define these lines and make them perfectly linear. I believe, therapy is an important place for finding healing. Do I think every traumatic story deserves a book? No. Of course, she is a child star, a celebrity figure to many. I had a lot of questions. Mainly, her motivation to write about her life, was it therapeutic? Wouldn’t therapy be the best reflection? There were two tragic tales involving the tv/movie industry and her mother. Was the purpose to expose the industry? In my opinion, that was a relevant topic. More than healing, it was necessary to understand what happens to child actors. I hope that her book is indeed one of healing for those in similar situations like McCurdy. I’ve become a bitter person and I’m resigned to that fact. I can’t change my circumstances, so why try to change who I’ve become as a result of them?If I ask myself why I didn't love this book, like many, maybe it's because I come from a culture that doesn't share traumatic stories on a public platform (especially when it involves a parent that died). It's deeply ingrained--it may not be right--but what good can come from sharing the story of your dead mother to the world? If healing is the purpose, a therpist would benefit. If sharing to help others, maybe it does, I don't know...Is sharing your trauma part of healing? The jury is still out on that, but alas, McCurdy did have a poignant story to tell. 3.5/5 stars"
61,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70492479-mara,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 stars - this is one of my favorite celeb memoirs I've read. I was not aware of the author's work as a child actress (I'm about 5 years too old to have been in the tank for iCarly), but I thought her exploration of both abusive mothering relationships and the toxicity of stage parents/forcing kids into acting was really well observed"
62,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/152660246-olivia-loccisano,Rating 1 out of 5,"I’m aware that the reviews of this book have been overwhelmingly positive, and that this has been a very well received memoir. However, I truly do not understand its hype. I do think it was important for Jennette to write such an honest memoir about her life and complicated relationship with her mom, but there was hardly any reflection in this memoir; it seems to be simply her retelling of events as they unfolded. The writing is extremely repetitive and simplistic. I can completely see this resonating with a younger audience (especially because her fan base is comprised of mostly teenagers who might be struggling with the same issues at the age from which she is writing/reflecting), but Jennette does not explore or dig deeply into any of the concerns that she brings up constantly in this memoir. She discusses, at length, about eating disorders, abuse, and complicated familial relationships- but just talks about her struggles with these issues instead of exploring the nuanced and complicated feelings of them. This memoir seems to discuss these events for shock factor instead of having them lead to an overarching theme. This was a very disappointing memoir for me."

64,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14514998-rachel-l,Rating 4 out of 5," 4 stars I have something to admit: I didn’t know who Jennette McCurdy was until this book came out. And when people look at me dumbfounded when I say that, I always get back, “iCarly!”. No hate to the show, I just never watched it. But with a book title as salacious as this one, I had to read it.The book is mainly about McCurdy’s rise to stardom, her experiences as a child actor, her relationship with her mother, and the abuse she suffered from those things. If you have an ED or it’s something that can trigger you, I would warn you to take caution and care of yourself before and when reading this book because a lot of the abuse in this book is linked to eating disorders and how her mom taught and coached her to be anorexic.I thought this book was haunting, insightful, and eloquent. At times it felt a little bit disjointed with the stories, but I understand it was snippets from her life compiled together. Growing up in Los Angeles, I myself have strong feelings about child actors and this just solidified a lot of those feelings. We wouldn’t ask a six year old to work in a factory, so why are they working in the film industry to support their family? Doesn’t make sense to me.I’m really glad I read this book and I’m looking forward to what McCurdy does next in her career. Whatever it is I hope it brings her peace and happiness."
65,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17420799-olive-fellows-abookolive,Rating 4 out of 5,"A brutally honest and emotionally raw memoir in which former Nickelodeon child star Jennette McCurdy discusses her upbringing by her volatile mother and how she was pushed into becoming an actress. I was shocked by how candid McCurdy was willing to be and I so admire her vulnerability as she discusses how the things her mother once did still affect her (which is now complicated by the combination of grief and relief she seems to feel since her mother died), but I think she could have waited a few years to write this book to have more time to fully process her emotions. It's absolutely worth reading, though, if even to simply find out what everyone is talking about!Click here to hear more of my thoughts on this book over on my Booktube channel, abookolive!"
66,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46430603-lucy-skyler,Rating 3 out of 5,"While undoubtedly important and thought-provoking, I can't help but think that Jennette McCurdy's debut struggles to achieve either goal its sets out for itself: to be a memoir and, above all, to chronicle and process the trauma Jennette's mother inflicted on her. The book was borne out of therapy, so it's no surprise that the first half (ie the ""before"" in the monumental event that was her mother's death) is the strongest and most compellingly told; it reads as the most worked-through, and it's necessary to lay the foundation for what comes next.The issue is that the ""after"" lacks detail. McCurdy comes off as (rightly) protective of her current situation and her hard-earned privacy. But we never really get to see her come to terms with her being glad her mother's dead - there are hints, yes, and it makes sense that this revelation would be connected to her eating disorder recovery, but the book is still ultimately the weaker for not letting us be involved in the process. Which would be fine, except that the book also doesn't deliver on other aspects of Jennette's life, specifically her career. As a long-term fan of McCurdy, I would have loved to hear more about her more recent prospects, such as her podcast and short films. I think it would have been interesting to have heard about her short-lived webseries What's Next for Sarah, and how that was potentially the first step in reclaiming writing for her. McCurdy rightly says she doesn't only want to be known as Sam, but I feel that delving a bit more into her own works would have helped the reader separate her from that role more.Likewise, being a fan has made me more aware of some of the things she's omitted. The whole point of the book is for her to tell her story, and she only owes us what she feels comfortable sharing, but it is a unique memoir in that it's potentially left me with more questions than I started with. You are arguably at more of an advantage if you DON’T know McCurdy and her work than if you do. Still, despite the inconsistent second half, some of the moments are very poignant, and I appreciate the candor with which she describes child acting. The final chapter is also a perfect ending to the goal of the book, and makes me eager to read her future essay collection."
67,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/117518033-kim,Rating 5 out of 5,"I am a hollow shell of a human being after finishing I'm Glad My Mom Died.(Sorry for the long review in advance because I have a lot to say...as per usual it seems like)To start things off, I'm not the kind of person to read ebooks. I can't really do anything about that when it comes to my NetGalley eARCs, but other than that, I like the feel of a book in my hands. I like to feel my fingers on paper as I turn the page, see my bookmark move through the book, and see my progress in real life vs. a percent complete number on my phone. All physical copies of I'm Glad My Mom Died sold out in my area even though it's been literally 2 days since the book was officially published and will be on backorder until the end of the month. I bit the bullet, created an Amazon account of my own, downloaded the Kindle app, paid $14.99 for the book, and IMMEDIATELY started reading it. (I will be buying the physical copy when it's not back-ordered anymore.)I didn't even realize it was almost 3 AM when I decided I was at a good stopping place and also realized I made it through 75% of the book already, and THAT is when you know a book is worth reading. You know a book is good when you lose track of time, you're fully engaged in what's going on, and you can't. Stop. Turning. The pages. (Or swiping them in this case lol.) I have never highlighted and made notes on so many things before reading this memoir either.Jennette McCurdy, as I'm sure she does for many of you who grew up watching Nickelodeon, holds a special place in my heart as being part of my childhood memories. I remember watching iCarly religiously when I was 8-11 years old. It was basically my entire personality when I was 9-10 years old when the show was at its peak (sorry to anyone who knew me during that time). I would come home from school and finish all my homework before parking myself in front of the TV waiting for an iCarly rerun to come on. I made sure I was in front of the TV by 8 or 9 PM every Saturday night when a new episode aired because my family didn't have a DVR at the time and it got to the point where I was flat out memorizing full scenes from different episodes and quoting them on cue. Hell, I even convinced my parents to make spaghetti tacos for dinner on multiple occasions and considered making my own butter sock for fun.I was absolutely heartbroken reading this memoir and learning that for someone who spent a good portion of her life making us laugh as kids and providing memories for our childhood, she got hers taken away from her due to an abusive, narcissistic mother who forced her into an industry she didn't want to be in and flat-out stripped her of her childhood. It really goes to show that you never know what's going on behind the scenes in anyone's life. McCurdy's mother made her the breadwinner of her family so early on in her life, she was taking 14 dance classes a week on top of acting classes, actual schoolwork, and eventually a country music record deal for a short period of time. I was so sad reading about how McCurdy felt like she and her mom were close and that she wants to do whatever she can to make her happy, even if that meant getting breast and vaginal exams from her, letting her shower her (with her brother sometimes!) until she was about eighteen years old, and introduce her to calorie counting which eventually leads to her eating disorders and creating a poor relationship with food. She knew that all of this was wrong-that she didn't want to be an actress, that she knew calorie counting was wrong, that she knew she had an eating disorder and wanted to change- yet she persisted through all of it because it's what made her mother happy and how she got her mother's approval. Even at such a young age, she felt responsible for making sure her mother's breast cancer didn't come back while she was in remission and I remember a scene in the memoir when her grandfather tells her that no child should ever have this much stress put upon them and that they should be allowed to have a normal childhood and I broke down in tears because he's right!The entertainment industry, specifically The Creator and Nickelodeon, did her SO dirty. I'm sure if you're on Book Twitter (or just Twitter in general, since it's been trending for about the last week or so) that you've seen the screenshots of parts of the memoir floating around about how The Creator made her drink alcohol at 18, forced her to take photos in a bikini, and promised her her own spin-off show which ended up being Sam and Cat instead. Nickelodeon offering her $300K in exchange for her silence about The Creator's abuse was so wrong on so many levels and I'm glad McCurdy didn't take the money.While this memoir was heartbreaking, it was also equal parts funny. There were times when I laughed reading her memories with Miranda Cosgrove, parts where I was like, ""Oh my gosh, I remember this episode,"" and parts where I laughed out loud in shock because no way did this just happen. Her writing style was super easy to read and easy to stay engaged in, and the short chapters also helped with that as well.I'm not going to lie, I thought the title was a little harsh when I first heard of the book (without reading the synopsis or the actual book yet), but after finishing it, I'll say that I, too, am glad her mother died. I'm glad to see in different interviews that Jennette McCurdy is in a good place today and she's doing well! I'm also glad that she put this book out in the world because I feel like everyone needs to read this. If you haven't read this yet, what are you waiting for?5 stars--Trigger warnings: eating disorders, death of a parent, terminal cancer, child abuse, vomit/emesis, physical abuse, emotional abuse, mental abuse, mental illness, alcoholism and alcohol consumption, age-gap relationships (in this case it was grooming)"

I expected Jennette to be bashing her mother with every page. What I got was exactly the opposite. She actually loved her mom so much, more than anything in the entire world. They were connected and she could not imagine what her life would ever be like without her. It was only once they were apart that Jennette realized the toxicities of their relationship. I really enjoyed how this memoir read as a novel. It was so heartbreaking to read how much pain she has experienced throughout her life. From becoming a child actor against her own will to struggling with alcohol and food, she has had to overcome so many obstacles. It saddens me that it took so long for Jennette to find her support system due to the struggles of fame and Hollywood. All the trigger warnings for this one, but it is definitely worth the read and all the attention it is receiving. ⚠️ Trigger warnings: emotional abuse, alcohol use and abuse, eating disorders, negative body image, and death of a parent, to name a few.“Yes, it’s nice to make Mom feel good, but it’s also nice to feel good at something. Even if that thing makes you very uncomfortable at times. Even if that thing puts a lot of pressure on you. Even if that thing is very stressful. Sometimes it’s just nice to feel good at something.”“The first time I met [Miranda] was at a screen test for iCarly. She was leaning against a wall, sipping Coke from a glass bottle and texting on her Sidekick. Whoa. Coke and a Sidekick. This girl knows what’s up.”“I don’t like knowing people in the context of things. Oh, that’s the person I work out with. That’s the person I’m in a book club with. That’s the person I did that show with. Because once the context ends, so does the friendship. I yearn to know the people I love deeply and intimately—without context, without boxes—and I yearn for them to know me that way, too.”“Moms are saints. Angels by merely existing. NO ONE could possibly understand what it’s like to be a mom.”"

Jennette McCurdy writes in a way that is so direct, unflinching, and honest that I could relate to her on a deep level, even though my life is nothing like that of a traumatized child star’s. A few times, I had to stop the audiobook because her stories felt like they were hitting too close to home. The audiobook, narrated by McCurdy herself, was a treasure. Her rough-ish voice infused a lot of emotion into the story, as well, and she reads at a good pace. Highly recommend getting the audio version if it’s available to you.I am so happy for McCurdy’s writing success and the healing she has painstakingly undergone so far."

So why am I so interested in I’m Glad My Mom Died? Well, that title stopped me in my tracks. How could a daughter say something so mean and hateful about her own mother? Jennette McCurdy got her big break in Hollywood as a child actor on the popular Nickelodeon sitcom, iCarly. While being idolized by teenage fans, Jennette lived the life that her mom dreamed for herself. Throughout Debra McCurdy’s battle with cancer, she made it her mission to make her daughter a star. However, she never considered Jennette’s feelings. Just wanting to please her mom, Jennette endured years of abuse at the hands of her mother, a narcissist and hoarder, who was fighting her own inner demons. Debra McCurdy mentally and physically abused Jennette until the day she died. Through severe manipulation, she taught her to be dependent and anorexic. Later, Jennette’s eating disorder spirals into Bulimia. As she gets older, the unhealthy mother/daughter relationship negatively effects all aspects of her life. It is not until her mom dies that Jennette comes to terms with the fact that she has a problem. Through intensive therapy, she works through her complicated feelings about her mom, and takes the necessary steps to begin a journey to heal. I listened to the audiobook, which was read by the author. Initially, I thought this would enhance the book, but I found Jennette’s narration robotic. However, despite the uninspired narration, I really enjoyed it. The short, journal-like chapters kept my full interest. I am horrified by how Jennette McCurdy was treated by her own mother, and see parallels to the story of Gypsy Rose Blanchard. If you are looking for a fiction book with similar themes, check out Darling Rose Gold by Stephanie Wrobel.Jennette McCurdy’s story is another sad Hollywood tale that begs to be told. I’m glad she was eventually able to get the help she needed and is working on becoming happy and independent. I wish her all the best!4/5 stars"

Just as an fyi, I have never watched anything this actress/author has been in, including iCarly, so if you also have no previous knowledge of her, don't let that hold you back from picking this book up. The book cover and title is definitely eye catching in it's shock factor, but wow does the content of the book really back her up in feeling that way. Perhaps even more shocking is that it took her so long to see her mother in such a negative light. Some people have really messed up childhoods that translate into very interesting memoirs (see: Educated and The Sound of Gravel) and this book absolutely fits into that category. You feel horrified that they lived through all that, and yet you can't put the book down. I listened to the audiobook for this one and I was just absolutely riveted. By the way she narrates the audiobook herself and does a fantastic job (unsurprising given that she is an actress and a writer)."

I knew of the show iCarly, but really nothing more than that. Jennette McCurdy definitely had a difficult life, especially in the dynamic between her and her often abusive mother. She shares it all here. Her story held my attention, and my heart ached for all she went through. I chose to read this now, hoping for glimpses of grief, having just lost my dad one month ago. I witnessed some grief in the extremely valid complexity of her emotions, but there wasn’t much for me to relate to here, which is totally fine and to be expected. In retrospect, reading this at a different time may have been a little better.

Especially moms, they're the most romanticized of anyone.""Pick up Jennette McCurdy's I'm Glad My Mom Died for the title, stay for an amazing memoir! Going in, I didn't know much about either Jennette McCurdy or the world of child stars. There are some jaw-dropping moments about this world and her overbearing mother that are told in excruciating detail, but McCurdy relates them in a matter-of-fact way that really makes you reflect all the more about how McCurdy grew up. What becomes clear nearly from the onset is that she would do anything to make her mother happy. Her mother's desire for McCurdy to be a star overrode absolutely everything else. Engaging and sometimes darkly humorous read! 4.25 stars "

83,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/84444947-kat,Rating 2 out of 5,"this book should be published with many trigger warnings, the biggest of all one that says “do not step near this if you have, had, or consider yourself possibly one day having an eating disorder.” i think a lot of the things published in this book — which is NOT advertised as having eating disorder related content, and bears ZERO warnings — are wildly inappropriate and should not have been published. incredibly triggering piece of work.my biggest issue is the writing style. do we pretend that bad books are good now simply because the author had a bad childhood?jennette is a rich, famous actress now. ex-actress, i suppose, but she still is one, regardless of whether she ever wanted to be. at the end of the day, this memoir comes off as a quickly (and poorly) -written “poor me” dialogue from a woman with no insights on the world or, sadly, herself. the book doesn’t really have much to say. at all. ending felt rushed, which maybe is normal when you write a memoir so young.it doesn’t change the fact that her childhood was hard and her mom was a bitch. but that doesn’t make this a good book."

I'm glad she wrote this book to tell her story, child abuse in all forms it's far to common yet not talked about enough. There's so many of us adults that have to learn navigating our adult life after years of trauma. I'm sad that she had to go through all.

87,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54396048-maren-s-reads,Rating 5 out of 5,"I had no idea what to expect going into this book. While I grew up watching Nick at Nite, I was not much of a Nickelodeon girl, and was an adult by the time iCarly debuted. All I knew was that early reviewers were raving about how phenomenal this memoir was. And they were right. After spending a few hours listening to Jennette McCurdy tell her painful life story in one of the most powerful narrations I’ve ever listened to, I can understand why she chose to name her book what she did, even in the face of such criticism. I do not want to spoil this book for anyone who is not already familiar with her story, but I will say her mom was the definition of a monster and leave it at that. Weeks later, and I am still thinking about the strength it must take to live the life she has lived and then tell the world about it. The behind-the-scenes stories of her experiences in show business and childhood stardom fit right in with so much of what we already know - being a child actor in Hollywood can be, and often is, incredibly toxic, with lifelong effects. I highly recommend checking this one out, especially on audio, which McCurdy narrates herself. You will not regret it. Thank you to @libro.fm for my ALC of this book in exchange for my honest review and to Simon and Schuster for my finished copy. Available now."

Nadal raczej sceptycznie podchodzę do marketingu wokół niej (zaczynając od tytułu), jednak przeczytać zdecydowanie warto.

And what an eye opening experience it was! You truly have no idea what goes on behind closed doors for the stars you see on the tv. Jennette’s mother was abusive. She endorsed her anorexia and fuelled it, she both emotionally and physically harmed her and it took years of therapy after her mothers death for Jeannette to come to terms with this. The person she loved the most was also the most toxic. So happy for Jeannette to have found the strength to write this novel and let the general public into this really private area of her life.

I am proud of how she's recovered from the calorie restriction and anorexia and bulimia and alcoholism. Most of all, I am proud of how she has found the strength to recover from those spirals of shame and addiction and write her own story with her own hand. As much as I’m proud of Jennette, I absolutely hate her mom.I hate her for abusing Jennette physically, mentally, sexually, and emotionally. I hate her for making her daughter feel like growing up and getting a period was shameful, for teaching her calorie restriction as an eight-year-old, for manipulating her daughter into becoming a vessel for her own failed acting dreams. I hate her for never letting her daughter shower alone, for twisting her daughter’s genuine love into something that only served herself. I hate her.I wanted to talk more about the storyline of this memoir, but as I’m writing this I can’t think of one possible way to describe it that would do it justice. It would be an exercise in futility for me to describe the rawness and realness of this book, so I’m not going to try.The last thing I’ll mention is the writing: Jeanette talks about how much she loved writing, and how real writing felt after nearly two decades of pretending to be other people. Regardless of what her mother said, Jennette McCurdy is a fantastic writer. I will be reading absolutely anything she writes from this point forward.Thank you, Jennette.

93,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64126678-casey-aonso,Rating 5 out of 5,"jennette has so much more to tell in this than the time she spent on nickelodeon and i love the way she does it. there’s never a point in this memoir where a story feels out of place or unnecessary and the way she expains the struggles she’s gone through, while incredibly sad, is so upfront- you can tell that this was likely cathartic for her. i think where this book really shines is there, in her unflinching honesty. it’s borderline jarring to read at points if you relate to pieces of her life but not in a bad way, more a “i cannot believe she just said that but im so glad she did. i didnt know other people did that/felt that way too.” ofcourse it’s always really heartwarming to read about anyone finding peace with themselves and their trauma after a long struggle, but it was really, really sweet to see someone who gave so much of their life and talent toward the enjoyment of others finally be able to focus on the things she’d enjoy herself.i half read my hardcopy/half used the audiobook version and honestly if you’re able to i’d encourage u to try the audiobook. she narrates it herself and does an amazing job, at the more vulnerable points of the memoir it’s incredibly raw to hear her retell it exactly the way she intended it to be read."

98,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3268839-theresa-alan,Rating 5 out of 5,"Because of the title and cover photo, I thought this would be funny in addition to heart breaking—it was mostly just sad all around. There were a few chuckles, but I felt so bad for this little girl who lived with a hoarder who completely lived through her. I can sort of understand the mother behaving horribly because of her mental illness, but Jeanette had a father and grandparents and no one stopped the mother from putting her daughter through this. The father worked but the family heavily depended on the money Jeanette made as a little kid—that is just nuts to me. The sexual and emotional abuse the mother put Jeannette through boggled my mind. On the other hand, this was a really interesting read about what it’s like to be a child actor. It certainly didn’t seem like a remotely glamorous way to spend one’s youth.In the end, Jeannette finally starts addressing her trauma and dealing with her bulimia. The way Jeanette began healing was a little like how a substance abuse addict begins to get better. This is a tough, intriguing book."
99,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71278944-ki,Rating 1 out of 5,"Edit: After a lot of thought, I wanted to come back and give this review an update. I no longer consider it a 1.5⭐️. I wish I could give it 0⭐️, but unfortunately I cannot, so 0.5⭐️ is my best and final. My initial review got a lot fan girls’ panties twisted in a bunch and it’s like.. for what? Do you know this lady personally? Do you have some sort of financial interest in it? If not — beat it. Seriously. To reiterate and elaborate on MY opinion as someone who’s like you know actually read the damn book — I thought the writing and editing of this book was absolutely horrible. This read like a bratty entitled pre-teen’s diary. There was no structure at all. She ranted on and on about Ariana Grande, vomit and gnarly blow jobs. I’m astonished that it made it to publication.Jennette is a TERRIBLE narrator, it was like listening to nails on a chalkboard. Her voice was flat and dry the entire time. It was so cringey. I do not recommend this, not now, not ever. 1.5⭐️Jennette’s story was unfortunate and I’m glad she was finally able to realize, understand, accept her abuse and get the help she needed to move past it, but this book was not it. The story was incredibly boring and I found it quite difficult and I honestly wasn’t interested. It took longer to get through than I’d hoped. I did listen to the audiobook which was narrated by the author, and her voice was very flat and not engaging. I’m glad I borrowed it from the library for free. This was not the fantastic celebrity memoir Bookstagram & Booktok said it was. Sorry not sorry."

Considering I grew up watching Jennette McCurdy, wishing I was her, wishing I had the same life as her. The truth of her past is truly heartbreaking and shocking, as well as really really dark. This book just proves that you don't really know a celebrity, even if they look and act like they are the happiest.""I am 95 pounds. Or 105 pounds. Or 115 pounds. Or 125 pounds. Whatever the scale reads, I am that and only that. That is who I am.""This was way darker than I thought it was going to be. I had to take breaks during certain chapters from how harsh some passages were. But, unlike some people, I didn't skip a single chapter. Because Jennette didn't get to skip those chapters in her life. And yes they can be triggering, even for me who doesn't get triggered easily, but she included these passages in her book for a reason. This memoir let's her voice speak freely, without filters, let's the truth of some many years of abuse come to the surface, completely bare to the reader and I truly think it's an important piece of literature that should be read by many.""Fuck being a good sport, I'd rather be playing charades with Tom Hanks.""I truly admire her. Her writing was also really good, even poetic at times. She has a way of talking, as if she is speaking to a friend but also in a very beautiful way. Yet a way that doesn't embellish the reality of things. A way that marks your brain, making her words branded in your mind for you to think about again and again.""Through writing, I feel power for maybe the first time in my life. I don't have to say somebody else's words. I can write my own. I can be myself for once.""This is a really important piece of writing as it not only gives a voice to Jennette on the cycles of abuse she endured throughout her life but also gives a voice to the countless other victims of abusive and of controlling parents. Her opening up about normalized abused as well as abuse in the film industry as a whole, to me, will open up many eyes to the reality of these industries. We need to talk about it and by talking about her experience, Jennette has opened up the door to these discussions, which is such an important thing to do. ""A good investment for one person might be a bad investment for another.""She also talks about her anorexia which then transforms into bulimia in a way that makes everyone understand the reality of her situation and of many others, no matter if you have an eating disorder or not. And that is representation we NEED in writing. So thank you Jennette.""I approach the trash room and pull down the latch to open the chute door. I drope the scale down the chute. [...] The next day comes and goes. I don't get a new scale.""What an absolute masterpiece of a book. It is truly an inspiring piece of writing.""Jennette, what you're describing is... really unhealthy. Your mother essentially condoned your anorexia, encouraged it. She... taught it to you. That's abuse."""

It's expensive, a lot of work, and there's approximately 100% chance you'll screw up your kids for life. That said, some parents go into it for the wrong reasons and seem hellbent on harming their offspring. Part of the problem, no doubt, is lingering trauma from their own childhood.McCurdy's deeply personal memoir is important for all of us, as sons and daughters trying to rid our minds of a traumatic upbringing and as parents learning to recognize the cruelest, most abusive actions can come from a place of love. The context is that McCurdy was a Nickelodeon child celebrity on a TV show called iCarly. I never watched the show, don't know a thing about it, but I still devoured the memoir. Although fame is a very unique experience, the type of horrors Jennette faced as a child are relatable to all. She handles each chapter masterfully, writing in the present tense seemingly as a way to revert back into her thoughts at that precise moment. For example, her point of view is such that she does not recognize what's happening as abuse until much later, in hindsight. Of course us readers can recognize it right away.This memoir is a wonderful pairing with the new Britney Spears book. Both share horrific industry-related experiences as children, but their parents also share similar traits. The lesson for us non-celebrities is that you aren't obligated to love your family or stand by them through thick and thin. In fact, family might be the evilest people in your orbit, and the worst for mental health.Another great thing about McCurdy's book is that it doesn't try to force a happy ending. By the end there's evidence she's made progress, but it's also clear she's still struggling and maybe always will be. Sustained abuse, particularly during those instrumental years, is not something to easily shake off. Britney's book tries to give the impression she's all good now, with a great husband and recent hit single with Elton John. Clearly this was the wrong approach, since she ended up divorcing the husband before the book was released.I'm so glad McCurdy ends her memoir in a state of work-in-progress. She's still got a lot of life left to live, so it only makes sense, but it's also important for others struggling with similar trauma/addictions/mental health issues. There is no magic cure for this stuff.I love any memoir which dares to discuss uncomfortable topics with uncensored, brutal truth. This one certainly delivers on that front. I suspect it will remain a canonical title in the genre for its blunt approach and because there's such a vast audience of readers who can benefit from its pages. If nothing else, it deserves five stars for that title alone. Classic!"

The storytelling is very myopic and lacks any deep sense of reflection. This becomes frustrating when it starts to feel like McCurdy doesn’t take any ownership in her story—not that she needs to be blamed (she doesn’t), but at a certain point everything is written like the world is happening to her and she’s not an active participant in it. To me, the most important aspect of memoir is reflecting on the events you wrote about, not just recounting them, and I don’t feel like a lot of that happened here. I wish there had been better editing help to make for a better reading experience."

I never watched iCarly or Sam & Cat, I'm a Disney bitch myself. Other than All That, Kenan & Kel, Are You Afraid Of The Dark and The Amanda Show I couldn't name any shows from Nickelodeon until recently. Then one day I was on YouTube and fell down a Dan Schneider rabbit hole. Dan Schneider was for many years the most powerful man at Nickelodeon. He created shows like the ones I listed above and Josh & Drake, Victorious and of course iCarly and Sam &Cat. He's also ""allegedly"" a huge Creep and sexual predator. I read alot of Nonfiction so this book had already been on my radar but even people who never read Nonfiction are obsessed with this book. I was both excited and nervous to read it. I knew from the rather provocative title that this book would cover some dark things, but feared that Jennette McCurdy would be very ""woe is me"". I'm reading another memior and that author is so over the top ""woe is me"" that it makes me feel violent. I had to set that book aside for bit but I'll pick it up again soon. Back to this book though. I'm Glad My Mom Died is about the mentally, sexually and physically abusive relationship Jennette shared with her late mother. I'm not the first to say this but I'm Also Glad Her Mom Died. God! This book was harrowing. The media surrounding this book is not doing it the proper justice. I saw so many articles about Ariana Grande and Jennette's jealousy of her but Ariana is only mentioned like 5x. And the most unsettling aspects of Jennette's abuse at the hands of her mother are never mentioned. Enjoyed is not a word I use to describe my experience with this book but I did appreciate her story. I liked how matter of fact Jennette was in her telling of her story. There was no ""feel sorry for me"" energy. It was all just this is what happened and this is how I'm trying to heal. Jennette needs to write more. I would love another memior from her but I would also read a novel if she ever wants to do that. I also just found out she has a podcast so I will be adding that to my never ending podcast list. No rec because this book doesn't need it but I think lots of people will get something our of reading this book."

It must have been cathartic, to finally be able to out everything on the page, and I especially found the chapters concerning her mom poignant and powerful. Not so much has been written about the gaslighting and the abuse narcissistic mothers cause their children, a type of harm that even the kids tend to gloss over because they don’t want to hurt their mother with the accusation.I think the title and the package are brilliant. The writing itself left me a little cold. Everyone was talking about this being the celebrity memoir to end all celebrity memoirs, so I was expecting a writing on the level of My Body. It was a bit flat, a bit repetitive. Maybe some help would’ve been needed to completely flesh it out.2.5/5"

I think it's incredibly brave to put not only your screwed-up family, but your own struggles out there. Unfortunately, I think something akin to Jennette McCurdy's experience is what most child stars go through. It's no surprise so many of them end up with addictions and/or mental disorders.I hope this book spreads some awareness and makes parents think twice about pushing their children into stardom."

Jennette’s vulnerability and authenticity shine through in her writing, and I’m in awe of her resiliency and healing.

Well, the reading public can now consider her a legitimately talented writer as well (and, in a very serendipitous shift, a standard Google search result provides the sole listing of 'American author' underneath her name) with her candidly autobiographical work I'm Glad My Mom Died. If you ever thought that the U.S. entertainment industry often chews up and spits out its child stars without enough care for their safety / welfare or mental health, or that domineering 'stage moms' are the most deluded, manipulative, or vile creatures to walk this planet . . . this book will certainly NOT do much to dissuade you of those notions. McCurdy entertainingly fires a double-barreled shotgun blast towards her brief acting career AND unusual family life during childhood and adolescence - describing the psychological abuse / cruelty she horribly and routinely experienced, which caused eating disorders (anorexia, then bulimia) and other issues which then plagued her for years - to both settle the score on the folks who caused her said grief plus, at least in my opinion, to provide her with a needed cathartic closure of sorts. I wish her a happier and much healthier life."

124,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie,Rating 3 out of 5,"I’m glad my mother died by Jennette McCurdy is a 2022 Simon & Schuster publication.I have never seen an episode of iCarly, though I had heard of the show. I wasn’t familiar with any of the cast members, even Jennette McCurdy. I just didn’t move in the circles of folks who had kids at the right age to watch the show and it certainly wasn’t a program my own kids would have watched. In fact, Nickelodeon was a channel we had to pay for, back before cord cutting, that we never watched. So why was I interested in reading this book? I’ve always followed the psychological issues that child stars developed and what, if any role the parents played in that- or if it was the Hollywood machine or a combination of both things. With a title like this one, it was obvious that the author had some serious family issues, so I really wanted to see what McCurdy’s story was. Sometimes it is very hard to articulate one’s feelings about another person’s memoir, and that’s the case here. I think that not knowing the author in any way might have helped me to have a more balanced opinion, but it might also have been a hindrance, as I didn’t really understand the type of role she was expected to portray. Finally, I gave in and went to YouTube to look at a few clips of the show. All I’m going to say is I can understand why she might grow weary of it… in a hurry. *No offense to anyone who enjoyed the show.That said, the show was obviously popular with a certain audience and the original series ran for about five years. During that time, Jeannette McCurdy was living a life full of emotional abuse. Her mother, who had battled cancer when McCurdy was a baby, became obsessed with her daughter’s career, introducing her to anorexia to keep her body at a child’s weight, she still bathed her well into her teenage years, was religious when it suited her, and could turn vicious at the drop of a hat. If that weren’t enough, the pressures of being a child professional, and the passive aggressive atmosphere of the adults in her work environment, led to a world of mental, emotional, and physical illnesses for Jeannette, that she battled well into her twenties, which included eating disorders, co-dependent relationships, and alcohol. When her mother’s cancer returned, her abuse didn’t end, and maybe even ramped up a bit. It was harrowing to read about some of the ugly things this woman said to her daughter and the mess she left Jeanette in after she died.  Reading about this level of abuse and watching a young woman begin to circle the drain is difficult to read about, and it was even worse than I was prepared for, but I am glad it wasn’t glossed over. By the same token, I do wish McCurdy would have glossed over some of the intimate details of her romantic life. It was very off-putting, and TMI, in my opinion. Honestly, there is no way, I’d go into those details in a book that so many people will read or listen to, and I’d have to take into consideration that other people were involved and would be named, but people today don’t seen to get the concept of discretion, so I suppose I shouldn’t have been surprised… but really, do you all really want to read about her oral sex skills? UGH! Overall, though, this book confirms my thoughts on child actors and their parents. I hope this young lady continues to seek counseling, perhaps sound spiritual guidance, as well. I am glad she feels free from being forced to do something she didn’t really enjoy. I hope finds her niche, has balance in life, takes care of her health, both physical and mental, and will have a sound, solid productive adult life."
125,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury,Rating 4 out of 5,"Sometimes I give in to peer pressure. I could have read this earlier but 1) I didn't know who Jennette McCurdy was and 2) I assumed from the title it was one of these purposely-shocking books celebs and comedians sometimes write which I never enjoy much. But as the talk around the book kicked in I realized it was something quite different. I almost avoided it still because I don't like books with child abuse, but luckily this isn't one of those absolutely harrowing ones. McCurdy's mother is pretty horrible, but in a way where it takes a lot of recognizable traits many mothers have and dials them up to 1000. I listened to the audio, as is my wont with memoirs, and I was surprised that McCurdy's read is quite flat considering she's been an actor. But after a while you get a feel for her. She can act, she does voices for all the characters, that is what she's saving it for. Otherwise the flat read mostly fits the text, where she shares things in a spare and clear-eyed way. That's really what's so surprising here. This is not an over-the-top book. This is a book where McCurdy does a lot of work to lay things out just the way she saw them at the time, but with enough of her current perspective to help you understand just how bad she knows it was. It is quite delicate, really, the way she channels this younger version of herself who cares so much about keeping her mom happy. I kept thinking, ""Wow, she has clearly done the work."" She has been to therapy and it shows!I was actually looking forward to McCurdy's journey to figuring out that perspective, her mom dies well before the end. But we mostly avoid that, which is really my only note. And it's a very subjective one because I love that shit. McCurdy moves you briskly through the years, the writing focuses on individual scenes that help you see just where everything is. She is not precious about her career, not explaining the ins and outs, just treating it like the job it clearly was. There isn't no dirt, but as someone who has never seen any iCarly I was fine with this approach. I have no horse in this race. Big content warnings around eating disorders (in addition to child abuse, obviously) which make up a significant portion of the book and which McCurdy describes in detail. That said, I have read plenty of books (novels and memoirs) involving eating disorders and I feel like this one gave me the most comprehensive picture of what it's like, the emotional and physical feelings of it.

I was a few years too old for iCarly, so I wasn't really familiar with Jennette McCurdy. But everyone was talking about this book so of course I had to pick it up as well. Horrifying and darkly funny, McCurdy recounts growing up with a narcissistic, abusive mother and being pushed into acting at 6 years old. She talks frankly about her experiences as a child, with eating disorders, abuse in the entertainment industry, and the hard road to recovery. It's well written and accessible, and if you get the chance to listen to the audiobook you should. She narrates it herself. Just be aware that there is a lot of explicit talk of child abuse, anorexia, and bulimia so if you're sensitive to those things use caution. It's clear how much she's grown and healed to be able to write this the way she did, and really makes you question whether children should be full-time actors at all. Thank you to Libro.FM for providing an audio copy for review, all opinions are my own."

I haven’t really been familiar with Janette McCurdy’s work and didn’t know about the abuse and struggle until the book was announced. She talks about her early career as not having a breaking moment, fame just came to her with steady work and more opportunities- it’s also a reflection of how her eating disorder began to spiral. It’s not some massive breaking point; it’s the routines of life surrounded by toxic people, examples, and negative reinforcement. Celebrity memoirs can often struggle to translate for a broad audience, but this is a personal story that most people will see little reflections of in their own lives."

Kai atrodė, kad negali būt blogiau... Buvo. O iki šiol apie šią moterį žinojau lygiai nieko. Nežiūrėjau serialo iCarly, kuris ją išgarsino, nesekiau gyvenimo, nemačiau prieš knygą ir po jos buvusių interviu. Gal dėl to efektas buvo DAR stipresnis? Ir visai netrūko jokio konteksto – į Jennette gyvenimą pasinėriau ir stebėjausi – jos rašymo stiliumi, jos talentu, jos stiprybe. Kyla daug natūralių klausimų. Kaip niekas nematė? Kaip tie, kurie matė, nieko nedarė? Iš kur ji turėjo tiek vidinės nuojautos, nes iš pradžių tikrai ne stiprybės, daryti tam tikrus dalykus, priimti sprendimus? Jennette tikrai yra šviežias, ryškus, drąsus balsas, o ši knyga nusipelnė viso įmanomo dėmesio. Aš tikrai jos nepamiršiu.Atskiri komplimentai yra pavadinimui ir viršeliui. Tikrai nieko paveikesnio pastaraisiais metais nesu mačiusi. Ir knyga parašyta tokiu nerūpestingu, lengvu, tačiau puikiu stiliumi, kad viskas susidėlioja į neįtikėtinai kokybišką paveikslą. Manau, kad būtent toks tinkamas knygos apipavidalinimas lemia tai, kad ji būtų paimta į rankas tokių kaip aš – autorės neatpažįstančių, bet įdomių istorijų ieškančių. O šita istorija ne tik kad įdomi: artimiausio žmogaus įskiepyti valgymo sutrikimai, alkoholizmas, perfekcionizmas, iki vėlyvos paauglystės vaikus viename duše maudanti ir vėliau lytinius organus „dėl vėžio“ tikrinanti motina, miegojimas ant jogos kilimėlių, nes lovos nukrautos mamos daiktų kaupimo padariniais, toksiški tėvų santykiai ir ankstyva šlovė. Autorės dabartinis sąmoningumas ir situacijos suvokimas toks ryškus, kad kai sukontrastuoja su faktu, kad jai patyrus pirmąsias mėnesines, Jennette net nežinojo kas tai, nuoširdžiai susisuka galva. Nežinau, kaip ši drąsi moteris dar gyva ir nežinau kaip viename žmoguje telpa TIEK visko, bet jos drąsa verta visų komplimentų ir viso dėmesio šitai nepamirštamai knygai. Skaitysiu viską, ką dar Jennette parašys."

I knew nothing of this author other than seeing her memoir become a best seller. I decided to read it (audio) and on looking at her online, I saw a lovely pic of her standing outside of Simon & Schuster, she had made it in the field she wanted to succeed in. I found the narration to be a little flat, but I think this enabled the hard stuff to be said.This woman’s story is tragic, and I won’t overwrite this, but what I will say is that Jeannette appears to have moved on from this terrible life with aplomb and having written a wonderful memoir for the world to see. Living a charmed life on the outside, young girls would have idolised her from afar, but what she lived through was dreadful. As I listened to the audio there was one quote I wanted to find as it resonated and made me stop and think about this vibrant young woman.
“I take a longer look at the words on her headstone.Brave, kind, loyal, sweet, loving, graceful, strong, thoughtful, funny, genuine, hopeful, playful, insightful, and on and on…Was she, though? Was she any of those things? The words make me angry. I can’t look at them any longer.Why do we romanticize the dead? Why can’t we be honest about them?”
I can’t begin to imagine the process of finally coming to terms with what really happened and laying open her soul and such personal occurrences, but as the title says, this is the way it is. The dependence, enmeshment, and the many other things that went wrong here in this family is all laid bare as the author tells her story, no punches pulled. Not all that glitters is gold in this industry. I’m so pleased for the author that she has found her niche and her path and that she was still able to become healthy and find her voice."

I'm Glad My Mom Died é um livro de memórias que fala sobre trauma e o caminho árduo para superá-lo (ou conviver razoavelmente bem com ele). Não esperava que fosse tão bem escrito, mas me vi preso à narração da autora enquanto ela contava os absurdos aos que a mãe a submetera — abusos físicos, mentais e emocionais —, como se estivesse ao lado dela vendo tudo acontecer. Escrever um livro desse requer força para lidar com os fantasmas do passado e coragem para expor sua história ao mundo. Reviver o que você enfrentou, reconhecer que sua super-heroína foi a pessoa que mais te prejudicou e fazer as pazes com tudo isso, sem vergonha da jornada, é extraordinário.

In the aftermath of her mother’s death, she faces a slide into eating disorders before she understands the complex relationship between her and her mother that led her there.I think everyone has an occasionally fractious relationship with their mother, but perhaps not the extant that McCurdy does. From an early age, McCurdy’s mother micromanaged her life, pushed her into acting, and encouraged her in her spiral into eating disorders. Yet at the same time, she was an actress on a beloved children’s TV show, one I myself watched – and not one hint of it showed. I was really intrigued by this book because I was excited to see how McCurdy herself would portray her experience.McCurdy has a strong voice through this book, bleakly humorous and candid about her conflicting feelings about people in her life. Despite her being an actress, this really isn’t a Hollywood memoir but more of a recounting of a toxic mother-daughter relationship, which was what I was more interested in anyway. She presents the facts of her life with minimal judgment, placing the reader in each moment so that they can draw their own conclusions, and I think this really worked for the book.I did think the second half of the book was a little weaker though, as we skate past some of the major incidents in McCurdy’s life, as well as the realizations she has – but I understand this may also be due to how recent those latter events were.Overall, this was a sharp and incisive read that I really enjoyed, and one that I think even people who have never heard of iCarly will appreciate.Disclaimer: I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley.

Because the rating doesn't reflect the content. I did not like the content. I didn't like what McCurdy had to go through. But I love her honesty, her courage and her message. For that, this book deserves 5 great, big stars.✨ What I Loved ✨Writing: The first thing that completely sucked me in was the writing. McCurdy has an uncanny ability to write breathtakingly. It's engaging, dark and heavy while still strangely humorous. Not in a laugh-out-loud way. More in the woe-is-me kind of way. The way that McCurdy describes herself, her innocence and naiveté made this both heartbreaking and humorous.Subject: While I didn't actually like the subject of a young girl manipulated and abused by her narcissistic and controlling mother, I applaud McCurdy for being brave enough to tell her story. It was heavy reading that I could hardly stand for long at a time - but I still found myself thinking about this book whenever it was out of my hands. It has left an - I am sure - lasting impression me.Jenette McCurdy: I have never watched Jenette McCurdy in anything, not even iCarly. So apart from some memes I was unavare of her before this book was released. But after reading this, I have the greatest respect for McCurdy. Not just because of what she's gone through, though that is certainly enough to earn her everlasting respect. No, what I was most impressed by was her honesty. There's nothing swept under the rug in this memoir. Nothing held back. It's raw, honest and insightful. McCurdy not only talks about her abuse - both mentally and physically - but also about her road to recovery and all the many, many bumps on the way. This is a horrible but also great book, because McCurdy dared to write it.Follow me for more book loving content!Blog ✨ Facebook ✨ Instagram ✨ Twitter Blog Post: Which Book Should you read next based on your favourite Jane Austen Heroine"

Jennette McCurdy ist vor allem als Hauptfigur der Nickelodeon-Serien iCarly und Sam & Cat erfolgreich geworden. Ich persönlich kenne die Serien nicht, muss man auch nicht. Die Autorin erläutert detailliert und mutig ihre Befreiung aus ihrer erlebten toxischen Mutter-Tochter-Beziehung auf ca. 380 Seiten. Ihre Schilderungen beginnen an dem Punkt, wo die Mutter den Traum ehrgeizig verfolgt ihre ""Kleine"" als Kinderstar groß rauszubringen. Die Mutter verliert viele Jahre später den Kampf gegen den Krebs und die Autorin lernt erst nach dem Tod, dass sie als eigene Person leben darf. In dem Buch werden Themen, wie Essstörung, Erfolgsdruck und Machtmissbrauch aufgegriffen und gezeigt, wie die Autorin es schafft mit bitterem Humor und Kraft, die Kontrolle über ihr Leben selbst in die Hand zu nehmen. Großen Respekt dafür! Die Übergriffigkeit der Mutter gegenüber ihren Kindern und ihrem Mann kannte keine Grenzen und so wahr ich selbst während des Lesens über einige Szenen sprachlos. Das Buch ist keine leichte Kost, aber aufgrund der Thematik so wichtig. So ein mutiges und ehrliches Buch, das ich sehr gern gelesen habe.

Jennette McCurdy holds nothing back in this examination on her relationship to the monstrous industry and mother that made her the star she is today—but at what cost? I found myself far more interested in the times when McCurdy took a step back and reflected on the effects of these experiences, far more than simply describing what was going on. I wish there had been more of that.I’d recommend the audiobook for sure if you pick this one up. Her reading of it is engaging and quite emotional at times. "
144,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/141246723-eric,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow. That’s all I have to say is. Wow. This book was beyond phenomenal. It’s a beautiful and poignant examination on Jennette McCurdy’s life as it pertained to her mother and her acting career—starting all the way since she was six years old. Her mother had put her into acting because it was life she wished she had, yet obviously couldn’t have. This led to the enforcement of a job to a child who didn’t want it. Through the rest of the book, we watch Jennette’s life as it scrolls through different struggles: child stardom, eating disorders, and abuse.I think one of the things that made this book so connected to Jennette was that it was set in the present tense. It wasn’t a reflection of the past, it was a real current view of what was happening to Jennette. You could feel everything she was feeling. Whether it was happiness, frustration, anger, or sadness, everything that she felt you could feel it.Jennette has such a beautiful way with words. She’s not using big or fluffy words. Instead, she uses words that mean exactly how they’re supposed to mean and her power over that usage was phenomenal. She didn’t sugar coat anything. And I loved it.Jennette’s descriptions of her mother was not something that you just read, it was something you could see. Everything her mother did that McCurdy’s described you could see and hear so viscerally. When Jennette went into more depth about her eating disorder, my heart quite literally dropped. It hurt so much reading about it even though it was inevitably her life. She described her eating habits in such a raw and painstakingly truthful way. Her reflection on it at the end of the book had me crying in my car. I loved reading about the parts where she talked about her career in Nickelodeon. You usually don't see much about an actor's life backstage (even though Jennette's life back stage wasn't great either). I did squirm everytime I read something about ""The Creator"" only because I know how terrible that man is. I did love reading about the friendship between Miranda Cosgrove and Jennette. Media usually present the toxic aspects of female friendships, but Jennette showed the honest truth of two teenage girls who live similar lives without the toxicity the media likes to show. Even when McCurdy was going through a hard time, she could lay her head on Miranda's shoulder and have a friend in this friendless industry.At a certain point, you wish this book is fiction, until you have to google “is ‘I’m Glad My Mom Died’ fiction or an autobiography” only for you to get the sad news that it’s a memoir. But I think that it’s also one of the great powers McCurdy had with her words. She wasn’t just telling you about her life, she painted a picture. She was telling a story. A terribly heartbreaking story, but nevertheless a story.This book will be having you laughing, gasping, and even crying. It’s a deeply sad time capsule of Jennette’s life and I think it should be required reading. Not a statement, a fact."

Being a mother is something you CHOOSE so why treat your kid like trash?????? I’m done. I’m sorry to say this but the time you decide to bring a child to this world is your fucking job to take care of them, but they owe you NOTHING.Basically playing victim and choosing when to be religious is the mother’s motto apparently, she’s never wrong, she’s perfect, she’s given everything to her children, but oh “anorexia is nothing to worry about, darling”. I swear, I’m done with people. Thanks to Jennette’s mom her life is based on pleasing others and make her mom happy, which basically causes her a bunch of eating disorders, but when she slips?? “You’re not my kid anymore, but send money for a new fridge”. Please miss, GO FUCK YOURSELF.I’m so happy to know Jennette has found a way in life to be happy and she’s getting help💗 and also, putting herself first for the first time in years, which is something a lot of people forget to do sometimes (I include myself). This is not a book for everyone, if you’ve been through/are going through stuff like anorexia, eating disorders, bulimia, mental illness, anxiety, emotional abuse, addiction, alcoholism, and a large etcetera, please check the trigger warnings and I advise you not to read this book.Don’t get me wrong, it’s a good book, but oh my Beyoncé (the only goddess a pray to) how difficult it is, that’s why I prefer fictional books, so I don’t have to deal with the outside world.

I love that, despite the title, this book wasn't an all-out mom-bashing book but a real nuanced look at how her mom abused her in subtle and not so subtle ways over the years. If it was just like, ""my mom was a c-you-next-tuesday,"" it wouldn't have been quite so effective. We get the sense that Jennette McCurdy loved, even worshiped her mom at times, but that the abuse was so pervasive and hard to face that it took her years to realize what was actually happening to her. I left this book hoping that Jennette McCurdy has found some peace in her life. She is writing and seems in control of her own destiny, so I'm really rooting for her mental and physical well being. I really liked how close I feel to this story, especially since I listened to the story in audio format and could hear the author actually narrating it. It made me root for her success that much harder. A hard book to get through at times, and for sure a book to avoid if you are triggered by abuse, but I'm very happy I read it. goodreads|instagram|twitter|tiktok"

Happy reading!To discuss the book with us: https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/...Considering the subject matter of I’m Glad My Mom Died by Jennette McCurdy, I feel like saying I “enjoyed” the book isn’t as appropriate as I found the book heartbreaking and heartwarming in equal measures. This book won the 2022 Goodreads Choice Awards in the biography category, and I can see why, as I’m Glad My Mom Died is a powerful, poignant read.Jennette McCurdy is most well-known for her roles as a child actress in iCarly and Sam and Cat. I remember watching iCarly when the show was running, and it was one my favorites at the time. McCurdy’s Sam was one of my favorite characters, and I truly had no idea what was going on behind-the-scenes. I’m Glad My Mom Died reveals Jennette’s struggles with acting, when she felt like she was only in the profession because it was her mother’s dream, not hers. At the time, McCurdy’s mom had cancer and was dying. Jennette loved her mother and allowed herself to be started on the path to stardom at the age of six, to make her happy and gain her approval. Seeing her mom happy at her success was supposed to be enough. 

“She wanted this. And I wanted her to have it. I wanted her to be happy. But now that I have it, I realize that she’s happy and I’m not. Her happiness came at the cost of mine. I feel robbed and exploited.”

Of course, when you’re not in the job you want, you can’t stuff down the negative feelings forever. McCurdy came to resent the hold her mother had on her and their increasingly toxic relationship as mother and daughter. She increasingly becomes anxious, shameful, and self-loathing as she struggles to tell her mother that acting isn’t what she wanted to do with her life. These feelings manifest in various self-destructive behaviors like eating disorders, addiction, and risky romantic relationships. 

“Mom didn’t get better. But I will.”

The book starts with Jennette in her mother’s hospital room, where she lay dying from cancer, and Jennette then recounts everything that led up to that point. I’m Glad My Mom Died is heartbreaking, full of dark humor, but also cautiously optimistic, as Jennette discovers therapy and is working towards getting better. As someone who struggles with mental illness and is in therapy, I’m Glad My Mom Died is incredibly refreshing for its candor, which is telegraphed from the start by the book’s title and cover design.I wish McCurdy the best in her healing journey.-Cora Find this book and other titles within our catalog."

I've personally dealt with mentally abusive guardians (granted foster parents) and reading this made me feel a little less alone.I also think that for those that haven't experienced those things, this could be a real eye opener for those people. And hopefully teach them to notice red flags if they ever come across someone like that.And for those that are currently going through those things, I hope it will open their eyes to their own situation and feel inspired and encouraged to stand up and take control of their own lives.Lastly, for those that have already been though this, I hope they feel heard, that they're able to relate and take comfort in knowing they're not alone. (Like I did.)This is a very heart breaking, inspiring, funny memoir that I think everyone should read. I truly believe this has something in it for everyone that anyone could learn from and take something away from it.Honestly, this didn't even read like a nonfiction.

I had sporadically watched iCarly in my teenage years, but never thought that the actress of plucky Sam Puckett, who chows down food like no tomorrow and once smuggled a whole ham in her boyfriend's pants for her relative in jail, was suffering from a severe eating disorder.Just to summarize, her mother:1) forced Jennette to be an actor because it was always her dream2) taught her 11-year-old daughter to count calories, so that she would stay small and book more roles3) was emotionally abusive all around4) called her daughter a slut when she found out she had a boyfriend5) kept reminding her family that she survived cancer, so they would pity her and always give in6) discouraged her dreams of being a writer because she didn't want her pretty daughter to have a ""writer's watermelon butt"". (Incidentally, Jennette is a surprisingly good writer. I say surprised because celebrities typically have ghost writers for this sort of thing, but her prose flowed well and was easy to follow.)I could list more, but these were just the ones I remembered off the top of my head. Yet there were still people angry at Jennette when this book was announced for saying that she's glad her mom is dead, because family is family and you should always love your family. Fuck those people with a thorny branch."

Just wow.Allow me to start this review by congratulating myself on the first non-fiction memoir book that I've ever read in my life 👏🏻🥳To be really honest I have no idea what will I face in this book and I knew a few contexts from reviews and videos, but I really did go blindly and dived head-first into the book and it wasn't a smart move. This is probably the most triggering and disturbing book I've ever read...I love it so much. This is what it looks like to be fearless and unafraid to share the story of my life with the world. God- I aspire to be this level of fearless and unafraid. The only technical thing that I'm gonna review and mention is the writing. I was unmistakably amazed by the narration of this book, so essentially you will be following Jennette's life from her childhood to adulthood and I couldn't help but notice and felt how the narration is also mentally growing each chapter. I could feel that the early chapters came from Jennette when she was a child and I could feel that this was coming from a child's voice. The writing perfectly painted her own childhood and the same goes for the last chapters. If that isn't amazing, I don’t know what is. But that would be the only thing I'm gonna review and give 5 stars because this book really speaks to me, as cringy as it sounds but it really does, and because I love how fearless and unafraid she is about her truth. I know because a lot of times it's not easy to face and accept a bitter and hurtful truth. The book is pure awesome. And I think this book is not about a journey of healing and accepting the truth, but this is also a soft nudge to all the readers who would like to be a parent someday or who already are a parent to be responsible and loving parents. Let's not talk about how bad the author's mom was instead let us not be like her and never do what she did to the author. Let's be a parent who deserves to be a parent.I think this is an amazing memoir, I'm so glad that Jennette's memoir is the very first memoir in my life. It's powerful and fearless. I love it! I knew it took me a long time to read this but was only because I needed a lot of time to collect myself because of how disturbing this book is 😂 so glad I can finish it though. Fantastic book but I'm not sure if I'll ever read this again- but I recommend this if you're the type to enjoy someone else's healing journey.TW. Eating disorders, abusive parent, alcoholism."

I’m Glad My Mom Died is a memoir written by Jennette McCurdy who is best known for her role as Sam on ICarly. I knew going into this that this was going to reveal some dark times, but had no idea how much the author was going to be willing to share. Jennette doesn’t hold back on much and for that I’m thankful. It gave such an insightful and powerful tone to her story. I did the audiobook and actually hearing her read her story out-loud only added on to how much I liked this. Jennette shares things about herself, her family, her relationships that I think a lot of others wouldn’t of been willing to do. She’s so open about her struggles with mental health, abuse, sexuality, religion, and eating disorders. She starts her story exactly where she need to for us to fully understand how she got to where she is now. Jennette is perfectly able to tell her story without losing her voice. Her humor and vulnerability shine through. I didn’t think IGMMD would have me laughing about the OCD Holy Spirit, someone being excited about free cancer swag, or butter socks… but it did. I’m Glad My Mom Died had me laughing, gasping, cringing, and cheering for Jennette. I don’t know if she has plans on writing anything else in the future, but if she does it’ll be an ins"

I’m glad that Jennette was able to tell her story. This had to of been an extremely hard book to write. I’m proud of her for taking the steps needed to heal and move forward with her life.The second half of the book focused so much on her eating disorder. Major trigger warning there. The writing felt choppy. This book needed a lot of editing help. A lot of it was repetitive. Present tense felt a little weird. How someone manages to remember details and exact conversations at age six is a little mind blowing to me.

“I yearn to know the people I love deeply and intimately—without context, without boxes—and I yearn for them to know me that way, too.”

This just won Goodreads choice awards for best memoir and autobiography for 2022 and I honestly had no doubt it will. It was released in August but already has a staggering quarter of a million reviews and an average rating of 4.61. McCurdy is a great author and I am so happy for her.I grew up watching some of those Disney and Nickelodeon shows like Zack and Cody, Hannah Montana and occasionally parts of iCarly. As a young kid I was always jealous of those young actors because I was naive and thought that they have perfect lives and are already making fortunes at such a young age. This book basically shows us the other side of the equation and how much this success costs these young stars.I honestly had no clue that McCurdy had to go through all of that and I have much more respect for her as a person for being able to share those things with the rest of the world. The book title is very smart and here we have Jennette explains why her mother made her life a living hell and why she is glad that she died. Through this journey we get to see very heavy topics like manipulation and grooming and one very important which is eating disorders.As a pediatric resident I get to work with parents and kids, and we get to see all kinds of parents. We also usually have patients -usually girls- with eating disorders and this book just made me see them in a very different kind of way.I am always a bit scared going into books by famous people because there is always a chance, they have not really written it or that they wrote it, and it is bad, but people will devour whatever their idols write. But with McCurdy it did not feel like that at all. It felt like an excellently written book that is very personal with solid and funny writing style. The flow of the narrative was top notch, and I did not expect that from someone’s debut. Apparently, she always liked books and writing but her mother thought differently, and they even tried to offer her hush money when her show was cancelled so that she does not talk about her experience there but ironically, she will make good money from that now.

“Why do we romanticize the dead? Why can’t we be honest about them?”

Summary: I really enjoyed reading this memoir and although I haven’t read a lot of those, it is still one of my favorites so far with excellent writing that tackles dark subjects humorously. I don’t know if she has any plans of writing future books, but I will read them if she does."
164,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/151278630-jessica,Rating 1 out of 5,"This book should come with a trigger warning. Heck, life should come with a trigger warning. But for real, big yikes. Not very well written, no context, super cold tone with no self-reflection. If Jeanette really is healed from all of these wild traumas (which she probably isn’t, given the way it reads), she certainly left out any helpful insight to those parts. Reckless editing, super unclear intentions from the author, feels like a premature endeavor honestly. I wish this book had shed more light on recovery from the hands that are dealt to us, and the part we play in our own healings and sufferings. Everyone is saying this book is told with humor but it just felt really detached and unhealthy. I hope she finds true healing.Side Note: For someone who repeatedly shouts how much she “doesn’t want to be famous” throughout the entirety of this book…she’s really doing THE MOST to grab attention and make sales with the controversial title. She admits this in all of the press interviews which makes her voice as a narrator even more confusing and insincere to me.Another Side Note: Its awful and inhumane that she was a victim of sexual abuse on multiple accounts. I’m wondering if she realized she casually published an entire chapter about raping her boyfriend with no reflection or remorse though? It’s all told with such lack of humanness that I’m really not sure if she sees any of her own contributions to the fuckery that exists in life.The more I keep thinking about it the more angry I get and the more I just think this is the worst book I’ve ever read. Such an injustice to her own grief and a misuse of her voice and platform.She won’t take “hush money” because she’s so moral, but she’ll take “revenge money” made off this book because trauma gives you a free pass? She felt exploited by her mother and the industry and now it’s her chance to exploit all of them in return.That’s how it reads."

I won't be rating this book because it is someones personal story and it feels wrong doing so, but if I were, 5 stars immediately 

This book elicited emotions out of me that I don't normally feel while reading a book. It was painstakingly, breathtakingly, and heartbreakingly written. I was left feeling a complete sense of remorse and heartbreak. From beginning to end, the writing and the story did not falter. Jennette had this way where she can encapsulate you with her magnificent writing and heart-rending story. This book will be a book that I will be praising until the day that I die. Jennette McCurdy laid her heart out in this book. Not only for her readers, but for herself, too. This book did not feel like it was written for publicity, it felt like it was written so people could listen and hear Jennette's story. I undeniably heard her. I could feel Jennette's pain, suffering, anxiety, stress, and other emotions that she went through. She did an amazing job translating her emotions to her readers. By writing this book, we got to delve deeper into Jennette's life as a child actress and her other obstacles in life. We knew Jennette as this child actress with this seemingly ""perfect"" life. We never got to see the personal and mental issues she was facing at the same time. This book entails that it will be very candid and raw just by the title, ""I'm Glad My Mom Died."" I applaud Jennette for writing this with such candidness and bluntness. She was unapologetically herself. I could be talking about this book for paragraphs and paragraphs with just utter admiration. Everything about this book was flawless to me. She hit deep on this book. Overall, I would certainly recommend this book to anyone, but please be sure to search for trigger warnings. And, Jennette, if you do write more books, I would be all for it.Age Rating - 15-16+"

I must admit I’m not familiar with Jenette McCurdy, but after reading this book I definitely won’t forget her. I’m Glad My Mom Died is a heartbreaking memoir of Jeanette’s childhood a childhood that should’ve been filled with love, caring, fun and happy memories, but sadly it was the complete opposite for Jenette.

Jennette McCurdy's memoir is honest and reflective, key things you want from this genre. Even though I didn't know much about her beforehand given I was a Nickelodeon viewer from the You Can't Do That on Television and Hey Dude era of programming, having now read her book, I'm walking away with a ton of respect for Jennette. I can't imagine how hard it would be to wrap her head around the fact her mom was to put it mildly, not a good mother. Despite having success as a child actress, her life has been far from idyllic. Takes a lot of courage to open up and put yourself out there when the world can be so judgmental. I am glad though the general public seems to be overwhelming supportive with the publication of her memoir.Highly recommend you give this book a look and on a related note, it's high time ""The Creator"", one of Jennette's bosses at Nickelodeon, face a reckoning similar to that of Harvey Weinstein. The stories about him have been out there for years. The fact children remain the most vulnerable in the entertainment industry is shameful. Do better Hollywood!"

I knew it was meant to be hyperbolic, but also ironically honest. I discerned immediately that this was someone who had an immensely complicated relationship with her mother, a mother whose death brought her piece. And that's what this book was about. Jenette details the history of her acting journey, how it was forced upon her by a mother whose own acting ambitions failed - whose daughter was a receptacle for her dreams and vehicle to live vicariously through. She was abusive (physically and emotionally), selfish, manipulative and incredibly invasive. This is a story about deliverance, healing and acceptance. It's story about moving past what you've been told to understand as reality and make sense of reality on your own.Jenette has every right to be glad that her mother died. She has every right to heal and move on. I am so incredibly happy for her, and I wish her nothing but the best."

When the author turned 21, her mother, the person she spent her life pacifying and trying to make happy, died from cancer, and McCurdy found herself wondering who she herself actually is (except a self-hating alcoholic with an ED) and what she wants from life.To me, the disturbing factor of the book is mainly rooted in the fact that all of these stories from/about Nickelodeon/Disney child actors sound so similar, and still keep repeating themselves – this doesn’t mean that McCurdy’s story isn’t important or valid though. It’s a solidly written, interesting book that has proven to be helpful for other survivors of the system it describes.Probably best consumed in the audio book version, read by the author."

Coś tam kiedyś słyszałam o serialu iCarly, ale wydaje mi się, że w Polsce nie był on aż tak popularny. Czy to jednak ważne? Absolutnie nie, bo to nie jest tylko osobista historia aktorki, która może zainteresować wyłącznie jej fanów. To przede wszystkim historia dziecka skrzywdzonego przez matkę i jej niespełnione ambicje. Toksyczna relacja, która wpędziła Jannette prosto w szpony anoreksji i bulimii, z konsekwencjami których do dziś musi się mierzyć. Bardzo dosadna, przejmująca historia, ale jednocześnie napisana z lekkością i nadzieją, że wszystko w końcu zmierza w dobrym kierunku. Kotwica nie ciągnie już na dno. "

182,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19169870-scarlet-cameo,Rating 5 out of 5,"A la mayoría de las personas no les gusta hablar de las biografías como sí de un libro de ficción se tratará, pero ese no es mí caso. Yo consideró que el enfoque que se le da a una biografía es lo que la convierte en un buen libro: aún cuando las situaciones sean extremas o aburridas tiene que cumplir con ciertos valores, tales como estar bien escrito, hacer uso de la contextualización para que la lectura sea atrapante/graciosa/entretenida/filosófica, dar una voz y una personalidad al narrador y mostrar la perspectiva del autor. Quise comenzar hablando de estos aspectos dado que esta biografía trata temas bastante densos, lo que ha llevado a que todo el mundo y su hermana hablen del libro, pero pocos hablen de Jennette como autora. Triste situación dado que escribe muy bien, todos los aspectos que mencioné arriba están: se maneja un humor muy bueno, la voz seleccionada abona a lo que está siendo contado, se narra a través de anécdotas y ejemplos, pone sus sentimientos al servicio del lector en cada momento; siendo honesta, si el día de mañana saca otro libro sobre un tema completamente diferente, yo iría a leerlo sin pensarlo.Como autora, Jennette hizo algo tremendamente inteligente y es narrar su pasado como una voz presente; es decir, cuando la pequeña Jennette habla lo hace como una niña que ésta en ese momento viviendo la situación que describe, en lugar de ser un adulto tratando de proyectar los sentimientos de un niño acerca de una situación pasada. Optar por esta voz, que evoluciona conforme la historia avanza, permite que el lector empatice (aún más) con Jennette y elimina algo que (tristemente) es muy común en nuestra sociedad: pensar por qué alguien no hablo antes. Al estar en la mente de un niño, podemos sentir su vulnerabilidad, su poco entendimiento de una situación, lo manipulable que es, el apego a sus progenitores, la necesidad de complacerlos y cómo está siendo abusado de forma obvia, pero, hasta cierto punto, sutil. Conforme avanzamos en la vida de la autora, también entendemos esa necesidad de negar lo que paso, de aceptar una realidad que fue dolorosa (al punto que puede destruir su mundo) y de abandonar todo de un momento a otro.La historia que Jennette cuenta es dolorosa, extremadamente fuerte e incómoda y se nota que viene de alguien que ha decidido enfrentar sus demonios…así ese demonio sea su madre. Adentrarme a hablar a fondo de lo que se narra en el libro es redundante, para este punto mucha gente a hablado de los abusos que sufrió Jennette a manos de su madre, incluido abuso sexual, el cómo sus desórdenes alimenticios fueron parte de su TOC y la animosidad (y guía) de su madre, su insatisfacción y frustración con su carrera, la envidia que, valientemente acepta, sentía por Ariana Grande, la actitud de Dan Schneider respecto a ella y el resto del cast de iCarly, sus problemas con su propio cuerpo, y un montón de cosas más, pero poco se ha hablado de que la historia de Jennette no termina ahí: ella logro curarse, logro entender por aquello que paso, arreglar la relación con su difunta madre y trabajar en algo que ella adora. Podríamos decir que el libro termina en una nota alta: ella sobrevivió a su madre, sobrevivió a Nickelodeon y sobrevivió a sus adicciones.Consideró que en esta biografía se toma un tema que es muy poco tocado: el abuso de madres a hijas, y no desde el punto de vista físico, que es de lo que más se llega a hablar, sino psicosexual: cómo es que una figura tan romantizada como la madre puede abusar de su poder de forma tal que arruina completamente la vida de sus hijos. También toca un tema incómodo, aunque muy mencionado: el abuso de los niños actores, pero desde una perspectiva que te hace pensar ¿realmente valen la pena esos minutos de entretenimiento? Muchos niños estrella han hablado de lo difícil que es estar en la industria, de lo desechables que se sienten, de la cosificación, la vulnerabilidad y la violencia, y de cómo las productoras simplemente los ignoran en pos de mantener a su verdadero talento: productores, directores, gente poderosa que les de mucho dinero ¿Y los niños? Que les den a los niños, ellos son remplazables en 3 seg.En conclusión, este es un libro fuerte, incómodo, que por partes se siente un “reír para no llorar” y recomendaría que lo leyeran por los importantes mensajes que maneja, pero que se que mucha gente no aguantara leerlo. Las situaciones caen en el punto de que sabes que está mal, pero 3n la mayoría de los casos no son extremas, más bien es un ejemplo perfecto de como una víctima interioriza el abuso: las situaciones son como una gota, poco a poco se van dando hasta que todo cae en algo más grande, es decir, es un ejemplo perfecto de como se manipula a los mas débiles de forma que ellos ni siquiera pueden notarlo."

This is sold as a tragi-comedy. Only, there's no comedy. It's a tragi-whine. And, man does this pot need to be introduced to a kettle. Her entire thesis is that her mom is a difficult and destructive person who hurts those around her because she believes the other people are responsible for how bad her life turned out. And then.. that's exactly who Jennette is to every single person in her life and none of it's her fault and she never comes to a grand conclusion that she is exactly like her mother. In fact if she comes to a conclusion at all it's that she needs to focus more on herself. Which is a really weird conclusion to come to when you're trying not to be like a narcissist. She never comes to a conclusion that she should treat other people better or that she should have more gratitude or that she should be a kinder individual. It's just all about herself. To combat by having a mother who also lived by the same philosophy. (An example of this is that she didn't feel like she should have to treat fans good because she was unhappy with the decisions her mom made for her life. And her mom didn't feel like she had to treat her family good because she was unhappy with the decision she felt the other people made for her life. They both needed somebody to force them to step outside of themselves in a real way. And it was very hard to watch the constant self-centered behavior that they both displayed. Obviously her mom's was abusive. But that doesn't make hers healthy). And while I can empathize with the struggles she went through, my God, I needed a big lightbulb moment. And reading half a book about somebody's bulimia is downright tedious. Get that that was a big part of her life and a big part of her struggle. But that doesn't change how monotonous it was to read. The way she describes herself and her relationship with everyone around her is so poorly written that I don't really know why everybody likes it. I think you're supposed to like it because it's a shocking title. But she never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever explains why she's happy her mom's dead. And by the end of the book she has not reached some Grand understanding of herself. It is just like.., ""was my mom bad? Head scratcher. Weird."" I genuinely disliked this, and I went into it expecting that I was going to love it."

It is an expose not only of the world of Hollywood for underage actors but also of the oft-swept under-the-rug reality that mothers can and do abuse their children.McCurdy explores the complex interplay between love and hate, hope and despair, safety and danger, that defines the relationship between an abusive parent and their child - opening up the most vulnerable pieces of herself to show the world not only how she was scarred as a child, but how those wounds continued to fester into adulthood.Trigger/Content Warnings: eating disorders, alcoholism, child abuseYou can watch me review this book & all of the other 2022 Goodreads Choice Awards Winners here: https://youtu.be/fFKXJ1gsZA8You can find me on...Youtube | Instagram | Twitter| TikTokYou can join our book club over on Patreon...PBB Book Club"

What an absolutely wild memoir. Jeannette’s upbringing is told from how she was feeling at those moments in her life and it is so raw, heartbreaking, and often times hilarious. Based on the title, I was expecting there to be a lot of dry humour throughout the book and it did not disappoint - she has a very clever way of telling you about what happened (which is often times uncomfortable) while making you want to laugh about it with her. This is the most honest and weirdly beautiful book that I’ve read this year. The ending was perfect. "

That ish was annoying as hell.The great news is Jeanette McCurdy thought the show/her character were annoying as all get out as well!So while I didn’t have the same reaction as someone who grew up as a superfan of McCurdy’s child stardom, I thought this book was very well put together and really provided a lot of insight with regards to coming to terms with an abusive childhood as well as disordered eating and removing toxic people from your life (hopefully on your own and not because they finally kicked the bucket).

Thoughts:THIS. IS. MORE. THAN. JUST. A. MEMOIR.This is a look into how parents shape the course of your entire life. This is a look into the dealings of narcissistic people. This is a deep look into the troubles of Hollywood. This is a look into child stars. This is a look into body dysmorphia, dysphoria, eating disorders, alcoholism, drugs, and toxic relationships.I am truly moved.This story- Jennette’s story is brutal, candid and blunt. She has a way of telling her life with a nonchalance air to it, but still riveting.Mothers will disappoint you at one time or another (or in Jennette’s case time and time again). To unlearn and reset is one of the most difficult things to do and go through. I sympathize with and applaud Jennette with how frank she is through the process. I found myself chuckling with Jennette’s dark humor and pausing in contemplation when she stated some profound and moving thoughts. I will absolutely be leaving this memoir differently.

I was always curious about the actress Jennette McCurdy, since she had the same name as my late sister; though Sam wasn’t my favorite character, Ms. McCurdy did a great job playing her.In the years since, Mr. Schneider had a serious fall from grace, and some unflattering details came out about him and his work; Elizabeth Gillies once said on Twitter that the entire cast and crew of her show were almost fired by Nickelodeon during the filming of the “Brain Squeezers” episode. None of that, however, compares to what Ms. McCurdy revealed in her autobiography. Not only did people do the unthinkable to her on her shows, they even offered her money to keep quiet about it.Yes, this book is disturbing, and may make some readers uncomfortable…but, that’s kind of the point; she reveals that life behind the scenes isn’t all glitz and glamour, even on a kids’ show.

However, I was curious - precisely because of the title. Luckily, I got the audio book in German from NetGalley and I couldn't stop listening to Dagmar Bittner, the narrator of the audio book. In her biography, Jennette McCurdy works on her toxic relationship with her mother. McCurdy describes the pressures of show business and the consequences on their physical and mental health. For years she suffered from bulimia and panic attacks. She shares her insights behind-the-scenes at Nickelodeon, how child stars are conditioned to cooperate through high stakes, rejection and sometimes sexual harassment. Following her mother's death, Jennette McCurdy, after many years of therapy, comes to terms with the emotional and physical abuse she experienced from her mother. McCurdy questions whether mothers need to be put on a pedestal even if they get their children in trouble with their own ambitions. With this biography I have the impression that Jennette McCurdy is finding her own voice in life.Admittedly, by the end of the audiobook I was really taken with Jennette's story. I even think she’s an endearing person. Her storytelling style, her occasional satirical interludes, her authenticity and openness resonated so well with me that I now follow her on Instagram 😍😊☺️🤗.⁉️Trigger warning: alcohol abuse, bulimia, sexual harassment, sexual language.Deutsche Version:Jetzt auch in Deutschland erhältlich 🤗Ich gebe zu: Ich hatte zuvor nie von Jennette McCurdy gehört und der Titel des Buches war auf den ersten Blick zu brutal für mich. Jedoch war ich neugierig - gerade wegen des Titels. Glücklicherweise bekam ich das Hörbuch von NetGalley und ich konnte nicht aufhören, Dagmar Bittner, der Sprecherin des Hörbuches zuzuhören. Jennette McCurdy arbeitet in ihrer Biografie ihre toxische Beziehung zu ihrer Mutter auf. McCurdy beschreibt den Druck im Show-Business und die Konsequenz auf ihre körperliche und mentale Gesundheit. Jahrelang litt sie unter Bulimie und Panik Attacken. Sie gewährt uns Einblicke hinter die Kulissen im Show-Business wie Kinderstars konditioniert werden zu kooperieren, indem sie hohen Einsätzen, Ablehnungen und teilweise sexuellen Belästigungen ausgesetzt werden. Nach dem Tod ihrer Mutter, setzt sich Jennette McCurdy nach langjähriger Therapie mit dem emotionalen und körperlichen Missbrauch auseinander, die sie von ihrer Mutter erfahren hat. McCurdy stellt es infrage, ob Mütter auf einen Sockel gestellt werden müssen, auch wenn sie ihre Kinder mit ihren eigenen Ambitionen in eine Bredouille bringen. Mit dieser Biografie habe ich den Eindruck, dass Jennette McCurdy ihre eigene Stimme findet im Leben. Irgendwie bin ich ganz angetan von Jennette‘s Story und finde sie sogar sympathisch. Ihr Erzählstil, ihre gelegentlichen Einlagen mit einer Persiflage, ihre Authentizität und Offenheit kamen gut an bei mir, so dass ich ihr jetzt auf Instagram folge 🤩🤗😍."

Tak najprościej możemy powiedzieć o tym, co kryje w sobie „Cieszę się, że moja mama umarła"". To jedno zdanie jednak nie zdradza ogromu ciężaru, jakim obarczona jest powieść Jannette McCurdy. Nie ma w nim bowiem wyraźnego śladu po przemocowej, toksycznej matce, która chciała w córce mieć przyjaciółkę oraz lalkę. Która zarządzała jej karierą, dbała o codzienny wygląd, kąpała, ubierała, naruszała granice cielesności... Za pomocą szantaży emocjonalnych i przemocy psychicznej próbowała zabrać jej wolną wolę. Działania te natomiast poskutkowały zaburzeniami obsesyjno-kompulsywnymi i zaburzeniami odżywiania, a w przyszłości alkoholizmem Jannette. Zniszczyły ją i popchnęły na drogę destrukcyjnej kariery jako dziecięca/nastoletnia aktorka.Potrzebujemy takich książek. Musimy głośno mówić o tym, jak możemy kochać rodzica, choć nas niszczy. Jak wiele poświęcamy, by sprawić radość ważnej osobie. Jak destrukcyjne są zaburzenia odżywiania. Jak źle funkcjonuje nasze życie, gdy w głowie panuje bałagan. Gdzie szukać pomocy. A przede wszystkim musimy w końcu odczarować obraz Hollywood jako spełnienia marzeń, a młodych aktorów jako ludzi pełni pasji i szczęścia. Zaprzestać milczenia wokół groomingu i wyniszczeniu zdrowia na rzecz sławy. Nie akceptować ludzi, którzy w człowieku widzą jedynie obiekt. Jannette McCurdy w swojej powieści zahaczyła o każdy z tych tematów i dlatego jej głos jest tak istotny.Mocne, zabierające oddech i otwierające oczy.

I'm tired of people approaching me like they own me. Like I owe them something. I didn't choose this life. Mom did.
I have nothing but respect for my queen.I don't understand how we have normalised putting our parents in a pedestal despite their less than stellar parenting. How we have normalised bad parenting. The truth is parents can be abusive and hurtful, and their children don't owe them anything.I saw a lot of my experiences in Jennette's recounting. How her mother goes from being happy and loving to turning against her and name calling her YOUNG child. Her absent father. Her abusive grandmother.Jennette brings us a comedic and lighthearted story divided by short chapters from different points in her life. It's horrifying to see through her childlike lenses and her innocent reasoning towards her parents behaviours. And it's horrifying how no one cared or helped.I was also horrified by the conditions child actors are exposed to. Jennette started as a background actor and she recalls working 8 hours a day, standing in the heat, no one offered her food or water or bathroom breaks. And how her income was taken by her mother.This book felt like the beginning of the author's journey to recovery, so I wouldn't be surprised to see a sequel following this release. And I am looking forward to it.There is no right way to review a memoir but I appreciate Jennette's voice and I am so glad she is in a better place. In an interview I watched, she got teary at how proud she is of herself for choosing integrity and I couldn't have said it better.I grew up with iCarly and I am so sorry she had to go through everything she did. But as a fan I am so proud of the steps she has taken to take care of herself."

Because this was truly incredible, one of the best memoirs I’ve ever read.It’s so crazy to me how Jennette was such an integral part of my childhood and made me laugh every single day and this was her bleak reality behind the scenes. It’s absolutely heartbreaking to think of everything she was sacrificing for so much of her life for other people’s entertainment and to outsiders she looked so put together. Reading this really made me contemplate how strong she is as an individual, life really dealt her the worst cards but she still managed to bring so much joy wherever she went. This book just really brought back childhood nostalgia and solidified my admiration for her in a completely different way. I understand her now more than little me ever could.The writing here was the perfect balance of well paced storytelling and her witty sense of humour. It flowed well, was brilliantly paced and formatted in a way that made it all the more engaging. I’m fuming that her writing has been suppressed for so long, because she is excellent at spinning a narrative together. I was completely enthralled and found myself completely absorbed in this book for hours straight. Every time I put it down I just wanted to pick it back up again. It was that immersive. It almost felt like a conversation with an old friend, there was something intimate and extremely vulnerable about the whole thing. Nothing felt off limits and you really got to the deep and dark corners of her life.This is one of the most heart wrenching books I’ve ever laid eyes on, and the fact that none of it is fictional truly takes a minute to process. This book was so heavy, I felt weighed down reading it so I can’t even comprehend the baggage she must have been carrying while living it. It goes over oppressive religion, abuse of power dynamics and control, abuse and gaslighting, and the various mental health issues that followed (ocd, anorexia, bulimia, anxiety). Everything was so well articulated and made easy to understand for people who have never experienced those things, and it was all so emotional and harrowing. I really pray for her peace and health honestly, she has put up with so much and deserves so so much more.It was exquisite. She was so vulnerable and naive and it’s disgusting how various people in her life took advantage of it again and again. The highlight of this book for me after reading through her string of horrific relationships was her friendship with Miranda. It was really a light in this very dark story and I’m so happy there was at least one positive constant for her. I loved them. It was ridiculously sweet.Read this, I promise you you’ve been seeing it everywhere for a reason. It’s brilliant."

All that being what it is, I can’t recall a single auto-bio that captivated me as much as Jennette McCurdy’s has. I went from ‘no-idea-who-she-is’ to suffering through episodes of iCarly, Sam & Cat, and Between just to better acquaint myself with her career (and for the record, McC can act circles around Ariana Grande—just sayin’).I will never again look at child actors, stage moms, or Nickelodeon the same way.____________________________________“I poop and Mom gets a paper towel with water. I’m embarrassed she still insists on wiping my butt. I tried to tell her recently that now that I’m eight, I think I can handle it, but she looked like she was gonna cry and said she needs to do it until I’m at least ten because she doesn’t want skid marks on my Pocahontas underwear …Wipe. Wipe. Wipe.”“…Manager #1 repeats, “They’re giving you three hundred thousand dollars and the only thing they want you to do is never talk about your experience at Nickelodeon.” …What the f*ck? Nickelodeon is offering me three hundred thousand dollars in hush money to not talk publicly about my experience on the show? …This is a network with shows made for children. Shouldn’t they have some sort of moral compass?”"

I knew going in this was going to be an intense read, but my goodness.This book is upsetting, yet very well written. The short chapters help deliver the disturbing content in small bites. The narrative never dwells too long on a particular incident or style of abuse to convey the unending barrage of abuse Jennette received. I was surprised at the depth of the emotional abuse and what I found worse than that was all the people who enables Jennette's mothers behavior. Everyone who could have done something didn't.I listened to the audio book as I do with most author read memoirs and highly recommend it as a way to consume this particular book. The casual tone she uses as she talks about things like her mom still wiping her butt for her at 8 really helps you understand how indoctrinated she was."
203,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40997852-nicole,Rating 4 out of 5,"Jennette was so honest and I loved it. I listened to the audiobook and I highly recommend that format since the author herself narrates it. I used to watch iCarly often when I was a teenager but after that, I didn’t know what became of the actresses. The title and book cover honestly grabbed my attention and I recognised Jennette so I put the book on hold in my library right away. I’ve rarely read memoirs that are so open and transparent. Now my perception of Jennette completely changed (not liking the actress with the character!!) and I can only say I wish her the best in whatever career paths she chooses in the future."

How do you review someones life and experiences? Who are we to do that? So I'm just gonna make clear if I say something about the book, is related to the writing and not Jennette's experience. ➸ First of all, I must congratulate Jennette, for being so brave to share this, for surviving all that abuse, in more than one form, and for being so honest and raw about everything, it's so difficult to be honest, even to ourselves, is so easy to play the victim role and try to fish for sympathy, but she didn't. She was brutally honest, for the good and the bad, so, full bow to her.➸ Now, this book has the most catfishing marketing campaign ever, it was sold like a raw but portrayed in a very 
funny
 way, well, if someone think this book is funny, please share with the class which kind of weed you are consuming, because that shit hitting hard. Im gonna quote some of the blurbs this book has: ""How can a book be so sad and so funny at the same time? by Jenny Lawson, well Jenny was probably high while writing that. ""the journey that takes Jennette for finding herself far away from her mothers expectations is extremely funny. She mixes the world of relationships, grief, religion and Hollywoods trauma in a bold with a comedy touch. By Jerrod Carmichael, well fuck you Jerrod. Reading how someone was mentally, physically and sexually abused by her own mother, by the industry, how eating disorders haunted her life is not fucking funny. So please, if you are gonna read this book because you think it will be a funny read, put it back down, right now. ➸ I truly loved and hated this book at the same time, that's why I'm having such a hard time rating it, I loved how raw and direct was narrated, she didn't beat around the bush, she went straight to the point and you can read It very fast, it took me sometime because I physically and mentally couldn't do it, and this is the reason I hate this book so much, I see myself reflected on her in so many ways, luckily my mom is not like hers, I have the best mom in the planet and I can't believe how lucky I am, but her anxiety and her relationship with food hit a nerve, it was bulls eye to my most dark thoughts. Reading how unhealthy her relationship with the food was, made my stomach clench so many times, when she described with details how she made herself threw up, I could feel the vomit taste in my mouth. This book made me feel so many visceral reactions I swear to god I didn't have fun at all.➸ But I must say, this book made me question my thoughts about all the tv shows I used to enjoy when I was a kid, like iCarly, Jennette's character was my favorite, and now knowing how bad she was feeling doing it, breaks my heart. How little we know about other peoples life, it's so scary how just because we know someone because they are famous we think we actually know them. ➸ Im gonna be very brief with her mom, what a horrible person, she was a narcissist, a bully and since she wasn't satisfied with her life, she needed to made everyone else's life a nightmare. I know the book's tittle was polemic, but I must say it's perfect, she was, in a way, glad her mom died, because her mom's death was what made possible that she is so strong now, so brave and had the guts to expose such a traumatic life experience with the world. Children don't own their parents anything If they are being abused, why would you bring a child to this world if you are going to act like this?, she doesn't own her mom nothing, quite the contrary, she can blame her in almost all the shit she had to go through because of her mom's frustrated dreams. ➸ Please take into consideration that this book is very raw and very explicit in eating disorders, abuse in a lot of forms, toxic relationships and unhealthy behavior in general, please be mindful with yourself and don't be fooled by the marketing. ➸ This is my first non fiction and memoir book, and I don't think this genre is for me, I was interested in Jennette's because I was a fan of her when I was little, but I don't have any other interest for any other book, if you have good memoirs please let me know, I might give it a try. ➸ And last but not least, I am so proud of her, and I say this with a huge smile on my face, Jennette McCurdy, you did it, you are a writer, and you are a better writer than actress."

Ho letto questo libro assolutamente per caso, sono finita in un equivoco assurdo e simpatico, ma una volta capita la situazione non sono proprio piu' riuscita a smettere la lettura.Pensavo si trattasse di un libro umoristico e invece il tema e' legato alla patologia di disturbi alimentari e relazioni psicopatologiche tra madre e figlia.Avendo figlie nate alla fine degli anni novanta, mi sono ritrovata in pieno in ogni serie tiv e programmi citati nel libro, ho ricordato con simpatia quando con le mie figlie guardavamo Icarly alla TV, mai e poi mai avrei potuto immaginare che vita, che finzione, dolori e falsita' si celano dietro alle produzioni di intrattenimento.La storia di Jennette prende il cuore, vorresti entrare nel libro per abbracciarla e dirle che vale non per le sue capacita' ma solo per essere al mondo e desiderare la pienezza e la felicita' dalla vita.E se devo dirla sino in fondo, mi dispiace persino per sua madre, morta credendo alla sua realta' di vita distorta di finzioni continue."

I cannot believe all that she has been through, and still come out the other side with the ability to laugh and to keep going. So many people let her down, so many people abused and used her. Yes, the main culprit was her mom, a narcissist and hoarder who was verbally, emotionally, and physically abusive. But everyone around her could see this, and they still let it happen. It truly is a miracle that Jennette isn't dead. And I'm happy for her that she is healing, and hope she goes on to write more books: fiction, poetry, screenplays, whatever brings her joy! And directs more things! I feel like everyone who survived the gauntlet of being a child star should be in the director's seat of shows with child actors, because they are the only ones who can understand, or who might see, what's really happening with that child and be able to protect them.

She’s still fighting to overcome the inner turmoil to this day & who wouldn’t? Wow this book took off in popularity & was selling out everywhere ! I’m very fortunate that #partners @jennettemccurdy @librofm & @simon.audio #gifted me an ALC for my honest review.“My life purpose has always been to make Mom happy; to be who she wants me to be. So—without Mom, who am I supposed to be now?”We start out with Jennette coming to terms with her Mom’s passing. She’s always strived to please her Mom; to be the best actress, the cutest, the skinniest…Now she has to be this new person, a human that lives for herself, formulates her own opinions, makes important life choices. Jennette doesn’t know how to just BE. That’s a sad thought.Since she was as young as 2 years old Jennette recognized that her mother’s behavior was abnormal. When she was first diagnosed with Breast Cancer that’s when the hoarding began & it was all downhill from there. The family could barely walk through the house, piled floor to ceiling with junk. They slept on mattresses in the living room & had a rat/possum problem. The only escape was church when she actually got the family out the door in time to go. Three whole hours out of that hell-hole.Her Mom also lived her acting dreams through her & forced her to be the star of every show even though Jennette never even wanted to be a performer. Her only “free” time to be a kid was night.It doesn’t stop there.. but you’ll have to read to find out.

220,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101358081-imme-van-gorp,Rating 5 out of 5,"|| 4.5 stars ||This is a bold, raw, direct and honest autobiography by a former child star who was pushed into the profession by her mother ever since she was 6 years old.It recounts her career and personal life, talks about the abuse she’s suffered at home by her mother, but also shows the multiple mental health issues she’s developed, among which are various eating disorders, depression, a warped sense of self-image, anxiety, co-dependency, alcoholism, and OCD.The writing is simple, candid, sarcastic and straight to the point, which often resulted in accurately portraying a feeling of shocking helplessness or numbness, but could sometimes also mean that certain details were missing. Thus, the style had its pros and its cons, but the pros far outweighed the cons, and it was definitely well done.The story itself was very interesting, and, although I’ve already never had a great impression of the acting industry, this memoir really made me take a step back and realise just how fucked up it all is. And mostly, just how fucked up a parent must be to willingly put their child through that.It truly makes me rethink just how happy and cute all my nostalgic kid shows really were.. and how much of it was actually pretty horrific behind the scenes. This was hard-hitting, thought-provoking, important and sad. I feel terrible for what the author has had to endure, but also proud for what she managed to put down in writing with this book."

This book was just amazing. I’m Glad My Mom Died is a title I’ve thought about ever since it was announced and I don’t blame Jennette one bit. This book is so heart breaking and honest. The things she went through with her mom was so abusive. I grew up watching iCarly with my little sister and watching the show, you really would’ve have realized how miserable she truly was. Jennette is as real as it gets and isn’t afraid to share with her readers what happened to her, I respect that so much. I’m really happy for her that she was able to turn her life around. She’s definitely talented in writing and I hope she continues to write more. She deserves so much love and support.

It does appear to be one of the most talked about non fiction books of 2022. The actress discusses her roles, her love relationships and obviously her relationship with her mother.I looked forward to listening to this each day on my way to and from work. Even sneaking in some listening time while preparing supper. I had read a few reviews stating that Jennette wasn't the best narrator. However, I felt that given it was her personal story and she has spent a lot of processing what she went through, I took it as she was speaking to her readers in a conversational manner.

228,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2437247-lupita-reads,Rating 4 out of 5,Yikes. This was so very sad and heartbreaking to read. From page one I felt immediately intrigued and connected to the book & here’s why: I assumed from the title of the book she was going to spill the tea on her mom & trash her to filth. Instead what I immediately recognized on the page was the sad little girl that only ever wanted to make her mother happy & the fight to show that little girl that in actuality she owed her nothing. This felt written from a place of deep vulnerability & reckoning. You could also tell she held back on certain things she shared & I deeply appreciated that. Definitely a powerful memoir about healing a deeply complicated mother wound. 
229,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4163002-star,Rating 5 out of 5," Jennette's memoir was not only interesting, but also well written and gripping. Such an achievement since I never even watched the show that made her famous."
230,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista,Rating 4 out of 5,"
I’m in the ICU with my dying mother and the thing that I’m sure will get her to wake up is the fact that in the days since Mom’s been hospitalized, my fear and sadness have morphed into the perfect anorexia-motivation cocktail and, finally, I have achieved Mom’s current goal weight for me. Eighty-nine pounds. I’m so sure this fact will work that I lean all the way back in my chair and pompously cross my legs. I wait for her to come to. And wait. And wait.
Although Jennette McCurdy might not be pleased to hear it, I picked up I’m Glad My Mom Died because 1) My kids were fans of iCarly and I was peripherally aware of who she is, and 2) I noted the hub-bub around this memoir and wanted to know what that was about. And I can see why this has caught fire: Contrary to her most famous character’s persona of a wise-cracking tough kid, young Jennette was a scared, manipulated, mentally abused child of the ultimate controlling Stage Mother; and to the extent that the details of her childhood were undeniably repelling, I can imagine that anyone who grew up watching Sam Puckett beat up bullies would have their minds blown to learn what was actually running through her tortured mind on set. As for me: I was shocked to learn the details of this unhappy childhood — if not shocked to read that it sucks to be a child actor, and especially if it is to live out someone else’s dream — but I was engaged by McCurdy’s voice and evolving tone (ie, when she writes of being a very young child, she reports how she viewed her mother at that time, not through the lens of later wisdom; as she ages, the tone becomes more knowing) and there was recognisable craft to that. So, while this doesn’t read like the most polished memoir, I applaud McCurdy’s strength and candour and hope that her (eventually happy) story can serve as inspiration to those who resonate with it. I’m happy to have read this, if only to join the cultural moment, and McCurdy can rest easier knowing that if I saw her on the street, I would never yell “fried chicken” at her or ask to see her buttersock (and never before knew that these were things that people do to her; what a stupid price for fame).
I’m more convinced than ever that I need to quit acting. That it doesn’t serve my mental or emotional health. That it’s been destructive to both. I think about what else has been destructive to my mental and emotional health…the eating disorders, of course, and the alcohol issues. And then I realize that, as much as I’m convinced that I need to quit these things — acting, bulimia, alcohol — I don’t think that I can. As much as I resent them, in a strange way they define me. They are my identity. Maybe that’s why I resent them.
From growing up in a hoarder house (Jennette and her three brothers slept on trifold mats in the living room because their bedrooms were stuffed with garbage), experiencing poverty (despite her father working two jobs and her live-in maternal grandparents both working, the McCurdys were always behind on bills), and living with a mother obsessed with having survived breast cancer (the kids were forced to weekly watch a video of their mother singing them lullabies when she thought that she was dying), young Jennette learned to tame the chaos of her homelife by monitoring her mother’s moods and trying to always keep her happy. So when her mom suggested that she should start acting when she was six — something her mom had wanted to do as a child but her own parents wouldn’t allow — Jennette couldn’t say no, despite crippling discomfort and anxiety. Every move that Jennette made from that point was aimed at satisfying her mother’s ambitions (and alleviating the family’s poverty), and despite creepy/abusive behaviours at home (her mother insisted on showering Jennette, sometimes with her teenaged brother, until she was seventeen; her mother taught her “calorie restriction” and encouraged anorexia; her mother disowned her when paparazzi caught Jennette with a boyfriend [while writing in the same email that they needed money to replace a broken fridge]), Jennette put so much pressure on herself to do the thing she hated most (play Sam on iCarly) that she ended up punishing herself with eating disorders, alcohol abuse, negative self-talk, and codependent relationships; punishments that continued even after her mother eventually did die of cancer. While the details of Jennette’s early life are the stuff of pathos (she includes many more details than I’ve listed here), it’s perhaps even sadder to watch her — outwardly living a life envied by millions — spend years trying to shed her mother’s impossible (and manipulative) expectations.
I had put her up on a pedestal, and I know how detrimental that pedestal was to my well-being and life. That pedestal kept me stuck, emotionally stunted, living in fear, dependent, in a near constant state of emotional pain and without the tools to even identify that pain let alone deal with it. My mom didn’t deserve her pedestal. She was a narcissist. She refused to admit she had any problems, despite how destructive those problems were to our entire family. My mom emotionally, mentally, and physically abused me in ways that will forever impact me.
Most of the cover blurbs call this memoir funny, but it’s more quietly snarky-ironic than comedic. (McCurdy writes: There’s something about inherently dramatic moments that makes eye contact during those moments feel even more weighty and dramatic. It’s a hat on a hat. There’s enough drama here as it is. We’re good.) The blurbs also call this honest and compassionate and that’s where the best stuff is: this is the story of a survivor and I wish Ms McCurdy all the best.
My mom didn't get better. But I will.

I hope Jennette continues to find peace with her childhood and I will think about her and others who have been in similar situations of childhood fame forever. Im so glad these child stars are coming out with their stories and I hope it brings change to the industry and others like it… (social media family’s)… I really think everyone could get something important from this book even if it isn’t something you traditionally read.

However, with its provocative title, amazingly vintage and macabre cover, and rave reviews this felt like a memoir worth checking out. I'm happy to report that this memoir wasn't just good, it's excellent. ""Child stardom is a trap. A dead end.""It's no secret that Hollywood can be toxic and damaging to child actors. Jennette McCurdy's memoir tackles some well worn territory but does it in a way that is more thought-provoking and compelling then I've ever heard it told before. The harsh reality of child acting is laid bare as she recounts being told by casting directors or producers that she wasn't pretty enough, charming enough, or good enough for roles. Her most coveted skill was her ability to cry on command. Something she achieved by thinking about the various traumas she had already endured at such a young age. Jennette McCurdy's home life was astoundingly dysfunctional. Her father was absent and neglectful. Her domineering mother was a narcissist and hoarder who was emotionally and sexually abusive towards her children. The family constantly struggled to stay afloat financially. She was pushed into acting around age 6 by her mother despite having no interest in it. Her checks became her family's main source of income. At age 11 she developed anorexia which was taught to her and encouraged by her mom to delay puberty so she could keep getting kid roles. This evolved into decade long battle with bulimia and substance abuse which she is still recovering from.""Why do we romanticize the dead? Why can't we be honest about them?""Jennette McCurdy states late in the book that she believes if her mother were still alive she would still be trapped and helpless with no control over her life. She's glad her mom died because it was the only way she could make a clean break from her control and abuse. It's a sad admission that speaks to how much power her mother held over her. It's even sadder that she is likely right. “I'm trying every day to face myself. The results vary, but the attempts are consistent.”This book had one of the most candid and honest depictions of disordered eating that I've encountered. When I was in high school I suffered from anorexia. It consumed me and despite having been recovered for many years I still struggle to have a healthy relationship with food. The control that she felt her disorder gave her, the therapy thought records she filled out while eating, the shame and guilt that regaining the weight caused her were all things I experienced. She lays the realities of it bare. All the ugliness of it, all the complex feelings around it. At first I felt triggered but then I felt seen, like someone finally described the experience accurately.In spite of the trauma described in this book there are plenty of comedic anecdotes to offer some levity to the more heavy topics discussed. It's a story of pain and trauma but more than anything it's hopeful. It ends with growth, understanding, and acceptance. There's a self-awareness behind the writing that makes it feel much more authentic than most memoirs. Highly recommend.Trigger Warnings: child exploitation, mental abuse, sexual abuse, disordered eating."

There is tons of mental and physical abuse by Jennette McCurdy's mother. Her whole life, every waking moment, was controlled by her mother. Her mother's dreams for success and fame becomes Jennette's. Jennette had no personality of her own and had her childhood taken away; her income from being a child star is what her parents, grandparents and three brothers lived on. Jennette's mother was a master at manipulation and domination. To use such mind control on your little daughter is sick. I am glad her mother is dead too. No one in her family, except her Grandpa, even spoke negatively about all the pressure put on her shoulders when she was a child. She doesn't start to heal until about the age of 25 and she is honest in saying she has a long way still to go"

❝I can’t recall the last time I smiled unless it was for a scene.❞
This was such a powerful read!! I'm Glad My Mom Died is beautifully written, bold, and honest. I was absolutely spellbound by the audiobook! I had to force myself to pause it every day so I wouldn't finish it all in one go. It was truly a riveting read.I'm so proud of Jennette for writing this book, I can't even imagine how difficult it must have been...I highly recommend picking this memoir up! Before doing so, however, I do recommend checking out the trigger warnings because the book deals with a lot of sensitive subject matters in great detail.
❝How could I have not sensed what Mom needed? That she needed all of us to be serious, to be taking the situation as hard as we possibly could, to be devastated. She needed us to be nothing without her.❞

Men will never understand. Women with no children will never understand. No one but moms know the hardship of motherhood, and we non-moms must heap nothing but praise upon moms because we lowly, pitiful non-moms are mere peasants compared to the goddesses we call mothers…My mom didn’t deserve her pedestal. She was a narcissist.”When I was a child, I remember wishing to be on tv, to be an actress, singer, etc etc, just someone famous, but I’m so glad my parents and I never pursued any of those thoughts, because I can only imagine what my life would be like now (not like anything was ever gonna come from it). Jennette recounts her childhood, what it was like, growing up in a poor environment, with a mother that taught her how to be anorexic, and eventually bulimic by restricting her diet, and slowing the process of growing up, on top of the psychological, emotional, and physical abuse, she lived.Sigh. I could only echo so many other people have already stated in the reviews. It really helps to put a different light on celebrities and what they go through. It’s not all glamour; there’s also a lot of pain behind it. There’s a point in the audiobook where Jennette, who narrated this book, breaks down and cries, and I cried with her.It’s hard to rate a book like this, but I will say that I couldn’t stop listening/reading.

The pain, trauma and life she had growing up was difficult to hear, but so beautifully written and told. I certainly never had the same experiences, but I lost a parent recently and can understand and resonate with a lot of what she shares.

Tinha ouvido falar da série iCarly, mas não segui, por isso não conhecia nada da vida da autora e também não fui pesquisar. Quis ler as palavras dela sem nenhuma interferência que pudesse influenciar a minha leitura e a minha percepção. Este é um livro que se lê muito bem, com capítulos curtos e diretos, quase me esquecia que estava a ler um livro de não ficção, o que não é fácil, já que temos uma protagonista real. Uma criança de seis anos, quando começou no mundo do espectáculo, que só queria fazer a mãe feliz. Uma criança que viveu os sonhos que a mãe não pôde realizar. Uma criança que, por viver os sonhos projetados pela mãe, acabou com distúrbios alimentares e problemas de álcool. Uma criança que foi sempre manipulada e controlada pela progenitora. Tinha dezasseis anos e a mãe é que lhe dava banho e lavava os cabelos?!?!O livro está dividido em duas partes. A vida da Jennette até à morte da mãe e a vida da Jennette depois da morte da mãe. E foi nesta segunda parte que eu perdi um pouco a empatia pela ex-atriz. Não por não perceber o seu sofrimento, mas por causa da sua relutância em aceitar que tinha um problema e pelo seu comportamento perdido. Claro que esta minha forma de ver as coisas não é a mais correta, pois cada um tem os seus mecanismos de compensação e nem todos temos, nem temos de ter, clareza de espírito suficiente, ou meios, ou vontade de fazer alguma coisa para alterar a situação. E o estado das coisas também não se altera do dia para a noite. Além da vontade de mudar, o tempo também é um fator essencial. E deixar de ter uma mãe manipuladora, por mais que custe, também ajuda.Uma mãe faz muita falta, sei-o por experiência própria, mas uma mãe ""em termos""."
244,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22817184-christopher-febles,Rating 4 out of 5,"I’d never heard of Jennette McCurdy before this, since I was in my 30s when iCarly was on Nickelodeon. But geez, what a childhood. So many terrible issues, so much abuse and trauma. Almost hard to imagine.I hope there aren’t too many readers out there who’ll judge this book right from the title. I was carrying this around and could’ve sworn I had a few harsh glances. Call it tongue-in-cheek, but there’s quite a bit of truth to the phrase, once you read the harrowing stories. To my mind, the title is a multi-colored window into the author’s soul. It’s not one thing or the other. It’s many different emotions at once. What I’m trying to say is: don’t judge the author by the title. (And I’ll read what I want. Right?) I kept saying, “That poor woman.” I hope that’s OK. No one should have to endure all that: the manipulation, the distorted body image, the eating disorders, the illnesses. I felt terrible for her, and since she’s only 30, we’re left with a sense of incompleteness, or rather a small and growing sense of hope for the future. I enjoyed the last chapter for that reason. Oh, and child television behind the scenes is as bad as I thought it’d be. Yep.It's plain-stated and straightforward. I was going to say “matter-of-fact,” but the pain exuded in the words and stories are far more than cold facts. The language isn’t flowery and is often tremendously blunt, so it comes off as a personal journal. Short chapters and sentences and down-to-earth vocabulary, so easy to read, almost in one sitting. You also don’t need to know anything about the programs on which she starred, since I knew nothing about them but could still follow along. Trigger warnings: eating disorders, verbal abuse. (But I don’t know if you’d read this if you weren’t expecting them.)It's a stirring and shocking look at the struggles of a young woman thrust into the spotlight. I wish her the best."

Just a heads up, I did the audiobook and Jennette McCurdy did a fantastic job on narration!If you are like me, you do not know who Jennette McCurdy is or anything about shows on Nickelodeon, and that’s perfectly fine.What you’ll likely have is knowledge of some of these topics:✔️ Toxic family relationships✔️ Child stars who struggle to be normal✔️ Eating disorders✔️ Alcohol or substance addiction✔️ Grief for a loved one that you hate and love at the same timeI’m Glad My Mom Died is a heartbreaking, bleak and sometimes funny memoir by Jennette McCurdy.She writes about her uncomfortable, abusive and loving relationship with her mother, Debra McCurdy. Debra forced her daughter to become a child actor to make money for the family and also to live vicariously through her career since she could not become an actress herself.I never watched iCarly or the spinoff of Sam & Cat that costarred Ariana Grande, and I likely never will.What I will do is read more books by Jennette McCurdy since she is a fantastic writer and I'll cheer for her to have a happy and peaceful life. Hell yeah girl. You do you.I’m happy that you wrote this. I'm happy that you’ve gone to therapy for bulimia. And I'm happy that you can still find humor and forgiveness with such a toxic and terrible mother.Definitely get to this one if you enjoy memoirs.

246,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3793027-scratch,Rating 4 out of 5,"I don't read nonfiction very often, but when I do, a memoir is usually pretty easy listening as an audiobook. This one was no exception. If anything, I was a little surprised by the fact the writing really was smarter than I expected.When the protagonist opens by describing her very white-trash childhood, complete with minimum-wage jobs and stains and no proper dinner table, you don't expect the author to then pepper in insights into her own personality and draw parallels between events separated by years. She drew a parallel between a guy asking, ""What have I done?"" when he left his fiancée for her, and then herself saying, ""What have I done?"" when the guy she was dating decided to become a born-again Christian.Real life doesn't usually have callbacks like that. She did a nice job of describing the horrors of her childhood and career in Hollywood that she never really wanted. She also did a nice job of respecting her friends, as Miranda Cosgrove has no reason to be upset by this book. Cosgrove isn't mentioned very often, but when she is, it is only as a supportive friend of McCury's. We see her having sleepovers with McCurdy or offering to drive McCurdy to the hospital. Cosgrove has nothing to be ashamed of from this book.However, some guy in charge of creating the iCarly TV show does have every reason to feel ashamed. He sounds like a monster, and it sounds like he actually started to face some consequences for his actions, which is nice."

251,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5229386-alexa,Rating 4 out of 5,"It's a viral sensation in a genre I already adore, so of course I read it! I did the audiobook on several people's recommendation, and I'm glad I did... honestly, partly, because man this was shorter than I'd anticipated and I'm glad I didn't blow $27 on a hardcover (not that I could find one ha). And Jennette of course read her own words with such emotion at parts, and her performance of specific episodes involving her family were pitch-perfect.Overall, however... this was over-hyped for me. Gasp. I know. In my mind it's a 3.5 stars rounded up. If you're also very seasoned in super candid celebrity/child star memoirs about n-parents/overcoming addiction, you may feel similarly. You know how DEEP they can go, particularly when an actor is old enough to truly let loose. That doesn't mean this wasn't good. It was. But it's a VERY specific kind of memoir.To that end, Jennette McCurdy is a gifted, natural storyteller. The craft in each vignette, each story... the rhythm of the sentences, how she started and ended each one... chef's kiss. I saw in an interview she did that she's working on fiction now and YES. My thought when I finished was ""if she writes a novel it'll be incredible."" As detailed in the book, she's always been a writer, but her mom put down those talents in favor of pushing her into acting. Such a shame, but so glad she's writing now. The memoir is told in ""before"" and ""after,"" using the titular death of her mother as the dividing line, and the style is each chapter as a standalone story or moment, in chronological order, about Jennette's mom/family/career/disorder/recovery, etc. It's narrative in it's approach about 95% of the time. This is where it didn't quite live up to my expectations, personally, in part because I've watched a lot of YouTube interviews/podcast content with Jennette over the last year and know how thoughtful and analytical she is about her experiences and trauma... that's not in the book. It's obviously a conscious choice, but I can't tell whether it was Jennette's or advice from an editor about making the book more broadly appealing? Avoiding lawsuits? It's unclear. But if you've read a lot of memoirs and were hoping for the pauses between the stories where the personal analysis and reflection goes? The book is light on that--it's 100% about drawing as much as you can from the vignettes to get at the point. Meaning: the book is precise and CAREFUL and it's both the memoir's strength and weakness for me personally. It's so painstakingly and effectively curated and my gut instinct says that carefulness is because the person writing it wasn't even 30 when she penned it, and everyone involved--everyone--except for her mother is still on this planet. And who wants to be TOO messy in a memoir when you're only 30? I'd be careful too. (and yet, I've heard her candidly discuss her frank opinions about her grandmother, still living, in a podcast posted a few days ago--so Jennette is candid in other mediums, just not in this book) Still, I had hoped for more explicit discussion of her mom's narcissism, but there's really only one conclusion chapter that touches on that in any direct sense. She doesn't even address the title of the memoir directly--and it's such a brilliant kick in the face--though of course you only need the barest of reading comprehension to get it. I guess I was hoping for a tick of meta? Personal preference. Still, it feels short. I've listened to 10+ hour memoirs on audiobook and this one was less than 7 but felt shorter--and I didn't even speed it up! It's because it's a tight, purposeful narrative-based memoir that skimps on context. For instance, I am too old to have ever watched any of the shows Jennette was on. There's very little detail or context about... any of that. I've seen discourse about how shocking it is given what we now know about Jennette's ED that apparently her character was obsessed with food? She was a juvenile delinquent type? And there are other revelations that I only had contextualized for me by the Internet, because that context and analysis doesn't exist in the book. It means you have to be a certain age with particular background to get all sorts of additional context out of this memoir. Taking the memoir at face value with little to no knowledge of iCarly or Sam and Cat (which I learned a tiny bit about from a YT video the day I started reading this, as least!), I feel I got slightly less out of it? But, it's powerful, and it's speaking to a lot of people. For a whole generation, this is the first major star/cultural touchstone to speak so candidly about being raised by an n-parent/abusive childhood/complex grief/EDs. It's an important book and worthy entry into this type of memoir canon."
252,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82963121-ensaio-sobre-o-desassossego,Rating 5 out of 5,"Nunca vi ICarly e nunca acompanhei a carreira da Jennette. Sabia que ela tinha ficado famosa desde criança e sabia da existência do iCarly. Mas este título chamou-me a atenção e depois de ver a sinopse sabia que tinha de ler este livro.Estava com algum receio que a escrita fosse muito básica e simplista - já sabemos que há quem ache que a minha geração (e mais novos) é burra e não sabe ler coisas complexas - mas não foi isso que encontrei aqui. A Jennette tem um sentido de humor subtil, algo meio sarcástico, com o qual eu me identifiquei muito.Este livro já me suscitou várias questões e agora dou por mim durante o dia a pensar na Jennette e em quantas mais Jennettes existirão. A indústria infantil de Hollywood é bastante pesada, e mesmo agora com a exposição que os filhos de influenciadores têm na Internet para mim é algo assustador. É assustador porque 1) as pessoas não sabem quem está do outro lado do ecrã (e infelizmente o mundo não é um unicórnio cor-de-rosa fofinho) e 2) como é uma coisa tão recente, ainda não se sabe o real impacto que toda esta exposição terá nos miúdos quando cresceremNo caso da Jennette, ela tornou-se famosa muito cedo, para cumprir o sonho da mãe, mesmo odiando representar, ela fazia-o porque isso fazia a mãe feliz. Mas para além de não ter uma estrutura familiar adequada, ela passou a ser uma artista do Cirque du Soleil, como a própria diz, que tem o talento especial de ""chorar a pedido"". Imaginem, vocês têm 15 anos odeiam representar e para conseguirem chorar nas audições imaginam os vossos irmãos a morrerem com todo o tipo de doenças. Quando a pessoa adulta que te devia proteger não o faz, o que é que resta?O livro tem imensos triggers e eu que não passei nem metade do que a Jennette passou, tive de pausar a leitura em alguns momentos. É um livro sobre abuso parental, sobre uma família disfuncional, sobre saúde mental, sobre anorexia, sobre bulimia, sobre vivermos os sonhos dos nossos pais.A Jennette teve muita coragem em expor este lado da sua vida para o mundo e parece-me que houve um trabalho de terapia bastante intenso e doloroso mas louvável. Depois de todos os horrores pelos quais passou, ela parece estar bem. Parece ter superado toda a vida de dependência da aprovação da mãe.A capa tem uns tons fofinhos (apesar da imagem mórbida) e o título é bastante apelativo, mas este é um livro pesado. Não pelo tipo de escrita, mas pelo que relata. No final, nós percebemos este título que à primeira vista parece contra-natura. Uma mãe que ensinou à filha o que era restrição calórica, que não só ensinou a filha a anorexia como a encorajou. A Jennette via a mãe como a mãe perfeita, a mãe que se sacrificou em prol da felicidade da filha e, por isso, submete-se ao sofrimento porque quer fazer a mãe feliz.A Jennette foi muito muito honesta neste livro, fala de coisas muito íntimas e acho que eu gostei tanto de ler este livro exactamente por causa da honestidade. É preciso ter muita coragem para se expor assim, expor assim os seus traumas exige muita coragem e falar disto não só ajuda a pessoa que se expõe, mas também ajuda outras pessoas que passaram pelo mesmo. Eu felizmente tenho uma relação saudável com a minha mãe, mas há muita gente que tem relacionamentos tóxicos com os pais. É importante desmistificar a ideia que os pais são perfeitos... "

It’s humiliating to admit how much I wanted to have an eating disorder so I can be thin, because of the things people say about my weight. When I was 12, people called me fat and pig. I genuinely thought I was overweight and needed to lose weight because people kept telling me how big I was. There’s this term in the Philippines called “botcha”, it means double dead pig. At the time, it was all over the news. It was a word commonly said and thrown in sentences and my classmates used to call me botcha all the time. That’s when I started to be mindful of what I eat. Must eat healthy, must not eat sweets, green leaves are good, and so on. I still don’t have a good relationship with food until now, but it’s not as worse as before. This book is mind-opening on how abusive people can be without us even realizing it. Young Jennette was oblivious of how…bad and evil her mom’s actions were because her judgement was clouded with the false feeling of motherly love and concern.I didn’t think a book could impact me this much, could make me realize how serious this is.

Así, desde los seis años, Jennette se ve obligada a trabajar, renunciando a esos años que no vuelven, para no defraudar a su madre, una persona inestable a muchos niveles y para quien el chantaje emocional es una herramienta de uso diario. Además, a esto sumamos la presión que sufre Jennette al convertirse en el sostén de la precaria economía familiar.    A través de los ojos de Jennette, dado que todo está narrado en primera persona y en presente, de su mirada primero infantil y luego adulta, se hace un retrato de su madre. Una persona muy compleja, que ha tenido que enfrentarse a la enfermedad y que desde luego presenta rasgos de tener algún tipo de problema de salud mental sin diagnosticar y sin tratar lo que afecta fuertemente a la vida de esa familia.  Un libro durísimo y angustiante de leer y que al mismo tiempo te atrapa y no puedes soltar. Jennette McCurdy afronta sin filtros este repaso por su juventud, con un tono ligero porque no busca re-victimizarse, ni siquiera poner el foco en ella a pesar de hablar de su vida, sino hablar de una serie de problemáticas que lamentablemente son bastante habituales. Soy una persona que tiendo a huir los libros de personajes públicos (me dan pereza, que voy a hacer) y, sin embargo, esta lectura me ha hecho plantearme si me estaré perdiendo cosas interesantes. Creo que McCurdy utiliza de una forma inteligentísima su fama y visibilidad para ser altavoz de estas cuestiones. Creo que es un libro que además de generar mucho interés, puede ayudar a mucha gente, pero también aviso que no pasa de puntillas, sino que se enfanga, en temas como varios TCA, maltrato, adicciones, enfermedad de un familiar, duelo, relaciones tóxicas, el #metoo… por lo que juzgad bien antes de leerlo. Hay partes, que tienes que interrumpir la lectura, que ahogan.  Es un libro que también es reconfortante en alguna manera porque vemos como Jennette se enfrenta a sus demonios y con mucho trabajo y terapia busca una salida de la oscuridad. Me ha gustado especialmente que no se romantice el proceso de sanación y la terapia, porque es un camino muy arduo, con fracasos y recaídas. De hecho, sabes que, aunque el libro tiene punto y final, la lucha de Jennette continua.  Una historia de cruel crecimiento, de robo de la infancia, que nos enseña el horror que hay detrás de la vida perfecta que imaginamos de las personas que tienen fama y dinero. Un libro que toca muchos temas y que a mí me hizo reflexionar sobre el perdón, y darle una vuelta a lo que nos viene aprehendido, ¿realmente hay que perdonarlo todo?  Creo que estas memorias son importantes y a pesar de que ahora es un libro que está en pleno boom (merecidísimo), no va a ser flor de un día y creo (y espero) que se seguirá leyendo durante muchos años.

Paauglystėje viena akimi žiūrėjau iCarly serialą, kuriame ji atliko vieną pagrindinių vaidmenų. Tokią smagią, komišką, gruboką merginą, vis pakliūnančią į absurdiškas situacijas. Vėliau, kai ši knyga tik pasirodė originalo kalba, pasidomėjau kas ir apie ką ten - neatrodė, kad tokį paprastą personažą Nickelodeon kanale vaidinus mergaitė gali ir ažiotažą literatūros pasaulyje sukurt. Oi, sukūrė. Ir ne tik literatūroj, bet ir mano viduje. Čia yra labiausiai mane palietusi ir net sukrėtusi knyga, kurią šiemet skaičiau.Jennette gyveno disfunkcinėje šeimoje. Nuo ankstyvos vaikystės ji stebėjo tėvų rietenas, gyveno kaupikų namuose ir pildė visus savo motinos norus, net jei jie kirsdavosi su josios. Tapti aktore buvo motinos neišsipildžiusi svajonė, kurią Jennette pildė verčiama eiti į atrankas, šnekėti ką liepia, daryti ką liepia, nors jai to visiškai nesinorėjo. Motina tragiškai išnaudojo dukrą, o mergytė nuoširdžiai tikėjo, kad jai daroma gera. Kad taip mama stengiasi dėl jos ateities. Kad įtikti ir padaryt mamą laiminga yra jos gyvenimo tikslas. Ir ji jį vykdė. Leido su savimi daryti tokius dalykus, apie kokius matom gal tik nusikaltimų laidose. Nuo seksualinės prievartos iki tyčia motinos įvaryto mitybos sutrikimo. Jennette čia iki skausmo atvira. Ir aš tik pabandyt įsivaizduot galiu KAIP sunku jai buvo parašyt šitą knygą ir kalbėt apie savo artimųjų darbelius, kuriuos seniau ji laikė pavyzdingais. Gerais. Ji pasakoja apie siaubingas priklausomybes, Nickelodeon užkulisius, kuriuose dar vienas pragaras virė, apie badavimą ir vėmimą, terapiją, santykius su vyrais. Karjerą, kuri jai tapo prakeiksmu. Skaitydama vis googlindavau tas iCarly serijas, apie kurias ji rašo ir žiūrėdavau jas kitomis akimis: žinodavau, kad šioje scenoje ji neblaivi, arba nemoka teksto, arba vaidina po panikos atakos. Man buvo taip taip taip gaila Jennette. Be to, kad knyga labai atvira ir pasakoja vienus žiauriausių atsiminimų, kuriuos esu skaičius, ji ir labai šmaikšti. Tai dar veinas absoliutus magiškas prieskonis, mat kalbėt apie TOKIUS išgyvenimus ir dar pasitelkt humorą - next level. Neįmanoma atsirraukt nuo knygos. Jennettes stiprybe beproto įkvepia. Rekomenduoju absoliučiai visiems ir kiekvienam, nes bus ir įdomu ir padės suprast, kad net po labiausiai blizgančiais dalykais gali slėptis didžiausi puviniai."
263,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75009563-rachel-hanes,Rating 4 out of 5,"There’s a lot of hype over this book right now, and I can definitely see why. I remember watching Jennette McCurdy on iCarly. My kids loved that show, and I have to admit that I did too! I never did watch the spin-off show of Sam & Cat, because Ariana Grande’s character totally ruined that show for me. Grande’s character had that fake weird voice and played like she had something wrong with her, but whatever… In this book, we learn about Jennette’s life growing up with her mother and how she became a child actor. The McCurdy’s grew up poor, and her mother wanted a better life for everyone. Thank God Jennette was able to fulfill that dream for her- but unfortunately in the long run, it wasn’t Jennette’s dream. Jennette’s mother had stage 4 breast cancer, and survived- but had never been right afterwards. I am NOT condoning anything that her mother did- but after reading this book, it was obvious her mother was lonely and suffered from some sort of PTSD. Which if maybe she got some type of therapy, she wouldn’t have taken her bizarre behaviors out on Jennette. She did some rather inappropriate things with Jennette, and did not let her have any independence at all. However, there are some mothers out there who do nothing but destroy their own daughters life and reputation. There are mother’s out there who will warn their own family to stay away from them, because according to said mother they “need help”. They will try to destroy any friendships, relationship, career, etc… You see, Jennette didn’t have to watch her back 24/7, because her mom did try to help her- just not in a healthy way. I believe Jennette’s mother was very dysfunctional, but not evil like some. This book also goes on to Jennette’s personal life after her mother does die from cancer. It is very unfortunate and sad that she developed eating disorders, and did decide to quit acting. All in all, this is a touching and very memorable memoir. It deserves quite a bit of the hype, and I do hope Jennette comes out with another book because I feel like this one ended too abruptly."
264,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5858203-michelle,Rating 5 out of 5,"I had never heard of Jennette McCurdy until her book dropped last year, there was so much buzz about the content and the title is definitely emotive. This is the closest I've ever been to an eating disorder on page and this is not an easy read at all, it's eye watering. Even if you remove that element, the life of Jennette has been chaotic, unstable and a very dramatic place to be and a high percentage of this is down to her mother. It's worth noting Grandma, it's very clear that Jeanette's Mom is a product of her own mother. While this doesn't excuse all her abuse to her own family, it does underline that she was probably a victim herself and stuck in a cycle. In a era when many parents / guardians are including their children on their YouTube lifestyle channels, Instagram stories and TikToks, this book is a very timely publication and conversation to be having around child stars. The conversation around romanticizing dead mothers is also valid. It's OK to have complicated feelings when our mothers pass. As a child who grew up with a mother on one diet fad after another, along with a drinking habit, I'm very aware of the complexities surrounding my feelings about my own mother today and how her actions have impacted my life. I can only assume this will become even more complicated should I outlive her. This is a difficult memoir to get through but I'm glad I did. It's an auto five stars from me, I don't rate memoirs, I'm not here to evaluate anyone's life. As for the title, I'm glad my Mom died .... me too girl, it was rough to read, real rough."

Als kind keek ik altijd naar iCarly en zorgde ik ervoor dat ik op tijd thuis was om de nieuwe afleveringen te kijken. Het is zo verdrietig om te horen hoeveel ze werd misbruikt en mishandeld door haar moeder en door D*n Schneider. Hoe ze werd gedwongen een eetstoornis te ontwikkelen. Hoe dat allemaal achter de schermen aan de hand was en ik tegelijkertijd ontzettend aan het genieten was van datzelfde programma. Het schrijven van dit boek was vast afschuwelijk en doorzetten en afzien. En dan ook nog eens zelf het audioboek voorlezen… Alleen meer liefde voor Jennette. Zonder twijfel 5 sterren. "

270,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/92586127-sophie,Rating 5 out of 5,"I'm Glad My Mom Died by Jeannette McCurdy Synopsis: Jennette McCurdy was six years old when she had her first acting audition. Her mother’s dream was for her only daughter to become a star, and Jennette would do anything to make her mother happy. So she went along with what Mom called “calorie restriction,” eating little and weighing herself five times a day. She endured extensive at-home makeovers while Mom chided, “Your eyelashes are invisible, okay? You think Dakota Fanning doesn’t tint hers?” She was even showered by Mom until age sixteen while sharing her diaries, email, and all her income.In I’m Glad My Mom Died, Jennette recounts all this in unflinching detail—just as she chronicles what happens when the dream finally comes true. Cast in a new Nickelodeon series called iCarly, she is thrust into fame. Though Mom is ecstatic, emailing fan club moderators and getting on a first-name basis with the paparazzi (“Hi Gale!”), Jennette is riddled with anxiety, shame, and self-loathing, which manifest into eating disorders, addiction, and a series of unhealthy relationships. These issues only get worse when, soon after taking the lead in the iCarly spinoff Sam & Cat alongside Ariana Grande, her mother dies of cancer. Finally, after discovering therapy and quitting acting, Jennette embarks on recovery and decides for the first time in her life what she really wants.Told with refreshing candor and dark humor, I’m Glad My Mom Died is an inspiring story of resilience, independence, and the joy of shampooing your own hair.∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ What I liked about this book:I found this book to be incredibly candid and open. Jennette McCurdy does not shy away from discussing the dark parts of her life, including her eating disorders, addiction, and unhealthy relationships. I appreciate her honesty in sharing her story, and I think it will resonate with many readers.I couldn't put it down and read it in 2 days. I alternated between the audiobook and the book (I'm recovering from a TBI so can't read too much). I don't usually rate non fiction and grew up in a French household so never saw iCarly but still was heartbroken from Jeannette's story. Jeannette is an incredible writer and you can tell that she is extremely passionate about writing. I'm a huge fan of using dark humor to process trauma, I do it myself, so found her to be extremely relevant. I laughed, cried, and felt completely numb at times reading this book (I am not a book crier). ——-I can't say that I didn't find anything wrong at all about the book, but there were parts that were difficult to read. As someone who has also dealt with complex trauma, I found some of the details to be triggering, so definitely exercise caution if you were subject to abuse growing up. Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an honest, candid memoir about complex trauma, eating disorders, addiction, and fame. 10/10, totally worth the hype."
271,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108125111-persephone,Rating 2 out of 5,"when a memoir fails to be introspective, nothing can really compensate for this shortfall. it is especially saddening when the topics in themselves are extremely interesting but the way they are handled simply is ... not. to go beyond a superficial analysis shouldn't be too much to ask for what is supposed to be an autobiography !! on the other hand i do feel for Jennette of course, and her dealings with eating disorders that I relate to oh too well, but it is clear that she has a tendency to be self-enabling and especially when it came to her relationship with Steven. i think that a conversation should be had on the way that she treated him and especially how easily she disregarded his wishes when it came to their intimacy and was almost forceful with it. long story short, forcing someone into consenting isn't something one is supposed to do, no matter the reason why they refuse in the first place. "
272,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/157739903-sani,Rating 4 out of 5,"This review doesn’t come easy to write. This is the first memoir I’ve ever read, and the first audiobook I’ve listened to. I don’t have much to compare to; but at the end of the day, I know how it made me feel.Heartbroken. My heart aches for Jennette and anyone who went through similar situations; enduring so much physical, mental, emotional, and even spiritual abuse.Watching iCarly and Sam & Cat as a preteen, absolutely loving the way Jennette played Sam, taking so much enjoyment and pleasure out of each episode—being absolutely blinded to all of her behind the scenes. Everything she was going through, unknown. Her hating doing what she did, and my younger self receiving enjoyment from that same thing. It’s just such a weird and guilt inducing feeling. I am so sorry for her. I wish I knew. If I knew I wouldn’t support it. I’m sure it wouldn’t help much, since it didn’t stem from iCarly nor the horrible people she was working for, but rather the person she refers to as her best friend multiple times. I cannot imagine a mother who does the opposite of bettering your life, helping you achieve your dreams.I would keep renting, but mainly because this has me emotional. I wish the best for Jennette and hope one day she finds true peace within the world and herself.As for the book itself, I confidently give it a high rating since there was not a single thing I could complain about. It was interesting, it was quick, it was well written, it was emotional, it made me think/analyze; it did it all. Bonus, Jannette herself narrates the book, hearing her personally say those words makes it somehow more powerful. Additionally, she voice-acts most of the dialogue which gives a considerably better understanding of tone (and situation) than if it were read by the voice in my head.If you’re young, maybe younger than 16? I don’t necessarily suggest you read this. It has some NSFW stuff which I know my younger self would be very uncomfortable with. Though the option is yours, of course."
273,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/125075690-olivia-colby,Rating 5 out of 5,"Thank you Simon and Schuster for the ARC of this novel in exchange for an honest review :)With an eye-gripping title and a last line that makes your jaw drop, Jennette McCurdy is truly evolving the concept of what it means to write a celebrity memoir.Actually, to write this book off as a “celebrity memoir” would be a disservice and an insult. It is an incredibly captivating, nuanced, and deeply personal account of one overcoming a myriad of harrowingly formative childhood experiences that led to a coming-of-age consumed by exploitation, eating disorders, substance abuse, and grief.This story is told in a very fiction-esque way. Despite being 100% non-fiction, she writes in the present tense, moving us along very closely with her as she ages in what feels like real time. We as readers are able to see her vividly grow and evolve from a naive young girl to a strongly empowered woman who gains the capability to think critically about the world around her.McCurdy’s voice is sharp, witty, and finely tuned — she clearly has a knack for writing, which is one of her true passions, as she mentions a few times throughout the memoir. Even though the main concepts discussed throughout this book are grim, she recounts them in a way that is both humorous and brutally candid. All in all, this was a profound debut from an even more profound and illustrious individual.P.S. Don’t expect this to be a drama-filled “tell-all” — it’s not. There are bits and pieces about her time spent at nickelodeon, specifically working with who she refers to as, The Creator, but that’s about it. She touches briefly on the relationships she made with her co-stars, yet any part about her acting career is only included because it is integral to her overall journey as a whole."

But after finishing this book I am her greatest fan.Jannette McCurdy didn't have it easy - the acting career, a big dream of her emotionally unstable mother, was forced on her together with the full package of body image issues and mental health struggles. Balancing between a need to please everyone around, OCD, anorexia (encouraged by her mother) and low self esteem Jannette tries to navigate toxic spiral of shame and guilt that she was pushed into by her most trusted person - her mother. Feelings of being lost, unsure and helpless are delivered with such a powerful punch that it was almost unbearable to read. However this book also manages to be quite amusing in a very dark, tragicomic way. I am not sure how both those things are able to coexist but this book is exactly that - gut wrenching an entertaining. You want to cover your eyes but then can't help yourself and peek through your fingers. This memoir made me realize how extremely lucky I am. Immediately after finishing it I called my mom to thank her for peaceful, ordinary and very long childhood I received. Read it but only when you are in mentally good state. "

Sad too, that no one made any real effort to stop Debra's manipulation and abuse, and it was only after Debra's death that Jennette was able to come to terms with the toxicity of Hollywood, and the legacy of anorexia, bulimia and mental illness bestowed on her by her mother. I used to love watching iCarly with my kids back in the day, it was one of the only kids shows I enjoyed as much as they did, I don't think I'll ever think of it in quite the same way again."

This book was harder to read than I was expecting because the author was honest in how much she loved and wanted to please her mother despite her mother’s blatant abuse. Jeannette was brutally honest in this memoir and there need to be trigger warnings for child abuse, eating disorders, and substance abuse. While this book definitely made me uncomfortable at times it was a great look at the life of a child star. It was also a great story about resiliency and strength to put ones well being first which was great."

I don't know how I came to read this book. Maybe it was the title or cover? Like I said, I really don't know. Anyway, let's get to the point: Surprisingly, I really enjoyed this book. It was a very unexpected read. When I was on NetGalley and found the audiobook for it, I thought I'd give it a chance. I'm glad I did and I thank NetGalley from the bottom of my heart for the audiobook in exchange for an honest review. First, PLEASE READ THE TRIGGER WARNING BEFORE YOU PICK THIS BOOK! Triggers & Content Warnings • Ableism (r slur) • Fatmisia & body shaming • Child physical, verbal, and emotional abuse including gaslighting • Grooming and sexually predatory behavior toward a minor discussed • Hoarding • Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) • Eating disorder (bulimia) • Graphic disordered eating including food restriction, bingeing, purging, and over-exercising (theme) • Alcohol consumption • Emesis • Death of a mother from terminal breast cancer This book is about a toxic relationship between a mother and daughter. The book contains many important topics. The book is written very lightly and you want to see how Jannette continues all the time. You get an overview of the life of actors. The audiobook was also very pleasant to listen to. I mean the voice lol. There were really some scenes where I wanted to cry or was really angry. Overall, I really enjoyed the book and would recommend it, but as I said, please read the trigger warning."

Her writing is so clear and compelling and I appreciated how she let a moment hang for the reader to digest as opposed to explaining or analyzing it. I only know her from Sam and Cat because my daughter was into that show for a short while, so it’s amazing the amount of resilience a person can exhibit, pretending and acting and showing up, while inside they’re boiling over with pain. Her mother was a piece of work, to say the least, (so was her grandmother while we’re at it) And after reading this book, and then seeing a bunch articles in newspapers recently talking about how “our teenage girls are not OK“ and how society is doing this damage and society is laying on this pressure…I can’t help but wonder: What about the parents? Maybe I’ve seen too many Netflix documentaries and listened to too many podcasts, but it seems like each and every single person interviewed relays some sort of abuse they’ve suffered in their childhood. Are there any parents who just try to love and nurture their kids as best they can and not psychologically damage them? That would be worth looking into because I think stories like Jennette’s aren’t that uncommon, they’re just happening away from the spotlight."

The problem is, abuse does not excuse the poor and self serving behavior she talked about in her older years. This book to me felt like a way to just complain and vent, and if that’s the case, maybe it should not have been advertised how it was. I just do not believe that the way she worked through the plot was good or healthy. In my opinion it shows both a lack of maturity and the truth that she is still deeply injured and is not ready to truly receive help. "

It was disgusting the things Janette went through emotionally, mentally and physically at the hands of the one that’s supposed to keep her safe.

Dvi merginos diskutavo kas geriau, įdomiau, patikimiau – auto ar bio? Jos, pamenu, sutarė, jog autobiografijos/memuarai patikimiau, tad ir įdomiau. O aš manau, kad tai priklauso nuo autoriaus. Memuaruose, manau, lengviau manipuliuoti skaitytoju, pateikiant jam nevisai tikrą informaciją, sudėliojant akcentus naudingose autoriui vietose ir t. t. Todėl memuarus skaitau atsargiai ir su gera skepticizmo doze. Pirmiausia turiu pasakyti, kad klausiausi audio knygos. Gali būti, jog spausdintinė knyga būtų suveikusi kiek švelniau. Tad. Įskaityta ji pačios autorės. Klausiausi knygos beveik pačiu lėčiausiu greičiu ir vis tiek kalba čaižyte čaižė. Darėsi įspūdis, kad svarbiausia jai šia knyga buvo išsikalbėti – panašiai, kaip gulint ant psicholgo kušetės. Nepajutau, jog autorė norėtų gilintis į savo santykius su mama, apmąstyti juos. Baisiausios šios knygos momemtas buvo, kuomet ji pamėgdžiojo sergančios vėžiu ir jau žinančios, kad greit mirs mamos balsą-dejonę. Klaikokai mėgdžiojo ir kitų (senelių, draugų) balsus. Tačiau mamos dejonės sarkastiška interpretacija mane pribaigė. Mes juk daug ką apie save pasakom kalbėdami apie kitus. Ar ne? Ir jeigu čia buvo humoras, tai jau labai neskaniai jis čia suskambėjo.Toliau. Aš elementariai ja nepatikėjau. Su memuarais taip dažnai nutinka. Su Apšviestąja buvo tas pats. Daug skaitytojų nepatikėjo kai kuriomis Taros Westover patirtimis. O va, aš Tara patikėjau. Papirko ji mane labai paprastai – suabejojusi savo pačios atmintimi apie kai kuriuos skausmingus įvykius vykusius jos šeimoje ir nepabijojusi apie šią abejonę kalbėti knygoje. Ji skambino broliui paklausti kaip jis atsimena TĄ konkretų nutikimą. Ir broils jį atsiminė kitaip. Ką aš noriu pasakyti, tai, kad mūsų visų atmintis yra labai nepatikima. Paklauskim savo brolių, seserų, tėvų, draugų apie kokius tai svarbius mums vaikystės/jaunystės įvykius ir atsakymai gali mus labai nustebinti. Nesakau, kad netikiu, jog ji patyrė mamos prievartą. Tikiu. Užjaučiu ją – tą vaiką/paauglę. Tik sakau, kad man susidarė įspūdis, kad ji nėra nuoširdi dabar, šiuose memuaruose. Dar man pasirodė, jog jai nelabai rūpėjo paanalizuoti pačios mamos situaciją. Tikrai neadvokatauju mamai, nes visada baisėjausi tokiomis mamomis, kurios stumia savo vaikus į mados/šou biznį, tačiau šioje istorijoje man per daug nežinomųjų. Ir galiausiai, tiek rašymo stilius, tiek kalba man pasirodė skurdoki. Gal, kad šalia skaičiau kitus puikius literatūrinius tekstus. Beje, vertinu tik tuos 75 % knygos. Šiaip jau, labai gaila medžių. O štai intriguojantis pavadinimas ir labai patrauklus viršelis – super."

Thank you lulu for your amazing review🫶 If it wasn’t for your review I would have probably never picked it up I can’t believe it’s over. I finished it. My first memoir and my first audiobook. I finished it and it was…. An experience. I don’t even know how to put my feelings into words rnThis was emotional and serieus. Not funny. Not cute. Just purely emotional and serieus. The things she went through, the thoughts that went through her head and the struggles she had. It was all so painful to read, so raw and personal. I can’t believe a little girl went through those things and thought it was normal. I can’t believe a teenage girl felt this way, but discarded her own feelings bc she wanted to please her mom. I can’t believe a mom did this to her child and said such things to her. I truly have no idea what to say. This was just sad sad sad. It’s even more sad because she was one of my favorite Nickelodeon stars and I loved her shows so much. Knowing that THIS is how she felt? THIS is what she went through? I feel bad for even liking the shows. I wish I could write a better review for you guys, but I truly have no idea how to put my feelings into words. I also had so many quotes tabbed to show, but my app sadly enough deleted them:( Do I recommend this?Yes, but not to everyone! Please check TW before reading. It’s not an easy read- even I struggled sometimes"
297,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1170391-sara,No Rating,"NB: I don't rate biographies and memoirs.I've never watched iCarly (it was way after my Nickelodeon days of Sister, Sister and Kennan and Kelly) and didn't know who Jennette McCurdy was until I started to see some buzz starting to generate around her book. It's an incredibly heartbreaking and honest read, going into graphic detail of the life of a child actor pushed into fame by a mother who has some serious issues. Issues which manifest in Jennette with eating disorders, toxic relationships and some really disturbing disordered thoughts. Her whole life is consumed with being oppressed and moulded by this selfish woman who does not have her best interests at heart.The courage to write this and admit that your relationship with your mother, the one person who's suppose to love you unconditionally, is abusive must have been so difficult. I hope Jeanette McCurdy has reached some kind of closure here, and although I wouldn't recommend this read to everyone (Trigger warnings for days) I thought it was a powerful read. "

Jennette tackles some very tough subjects and i admit that i had a hard time reading this book myself. i honestly don't think it was the right time for me to read this book, but that doesn't change the beauty of it!for all the people who have read this book and were a little too familiar with the topics, take care of yourself and know that you’re not alone. <33"

304,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,Rating 5 out of 5,"Fantastic autobiography!‘I’m Glad My Mom Died’ by Jennette McCurdy is authentic and insightful. A child actor who gained success and fame, McCurdy nonetheless began to unravel when she grew up. She knew she needed help, but why, and for what, she didn’t know exactly. The bulimia was obviously a problem - why couldn’t she stop? Why the anxiety attacks? Eventually, a few friends, lovers and therapists opened her eyes. I have copied the cover blurb below:” A heartbreaking and hilarious memoir by Jennette McCurdy about her struggles as a former child actor—including eating disorders, addiction, and a complicated relationship with her overbearing mother—and how she retook control of her life. Jennette McCurdy was six years old when she had her first acting audition. Her mother’s dream was for her only daughter to become a star, and Jennette would do anything to make her mother happy. So she went along with what Mom called “calorie restriction,” eating little and weighing herself five times a day. She endured extensive at-home makeovers while Mom chided, “Your eyelashes are invisible, okay? You think Dakota Fanning doesn’t tint hers?” She was even showered by Mom until age sixteen while sharing her diaries, email, and all her income.In I’m Glad My Mom Died, Jennette recounts all this in unflinching detail—just as she chronicles what happens when the dream finally comes true. Cast in a new Nickelodeon series called iCarly, she is thrust into fame. Though Mom is ecstatic, emailing fan club moderators and getting on a first-name basis with the paparazzi (“Hi Gale!”), Jennette is riddled with anxiety, shame, and self-loathing, which manifest into eating disorders, addiction, and a series of unhealthy relationships. These issues only get worse when, soon after taking the lead in the iCarly spinoff Sam & Cat alongside Ariana Grande, her mother dies of cancer. Finally, after discovering therapy and quitting acting, Jennette embarks on recovery and decides for the first time in her life what she really wants.Told with refreshing candor and dark humor, I’m Glad My Mom Died is an inspiring story of resilience, independence, and the joy of shampooing your own hair.”There was no cable TV or a Nickelodeon channel when I was a child. I never saw the TV show iCarly until a few days ago when I watched videos on Youtube. Frankly, I don’t see the humor which was supposed to be there, apparently, a laugh track sounding after almost every line during a scene. But I’ve never liked family or girlish sitcoms much. I suspect I would not have enjoyed her show even if I had been a tween during the era ‘iCarly’ was on. At that time of my life, I avoided shows like hers because the teen stars seemed so pulled together, and their home lives so clean and wonderful, with normal parenting. I had none of those things as a child, so I felt a great deal of angst watching a show about ‘normal’ teens or families. However, at times I did watch a sitcom now and then simply to adjust my behavior at school, memorize how they talked, joked and acted, learn what was important to them to appear be a regular kid. My friends at school would be excited about some TV show, and I wanted to be able to talk about it as excitedly as they did. Of course, I was acting. I never invited a single kid during my entire school life to my home. Only one girl ever did a sleepover at my house, when I was in the fifth grade, because she wanted it. She only lived two blocks away from my parent’s house, so she already sort of knew the state of it. But she never did a repeat, and I was never invited to her house for a sleepover.I never thought about that maybe many current actors on TV, including child actors, are and were totally acting about having a ‘normal’ home life and family, both in a show and when discussing their so-called “past” with interviewers today. Until now. I did know many actors in the early 20th century who appeared in classic and famous movies came from impoverished and sometimes brutal childhoods. I knew the original Hollywood studio bosses were also brutal. I knew the brutality, rape and blackmail was covered up until many of those studio bosses died. But today? Or in the late 20th or 21st century?I am reading biographies and autobiographies that shock me, like “I’m Glad My Mom Died”. I’m not shocked because of the reality there can be bad moms, or that a faked family narrative can be impressed onto children to such a degree as to completely warp a kid’s sense of reality and smother all questions and thinking. I AM shocked by the many current studios, producers of entertainment and agents of entertainers who are willingly and knowingly warping reality and smothering all questions when they notice how crazy some of the parents of child actors are, or that an adult or child entertainer is exhibiting mental illness.That parents can be narcissistic, selfish and cruel to their children all the while they are declaring how much they love their kids, so twisting their kids’ sense of reality and love that children can’t figure out anything regarding their gut emotions is nothing new to me. Such kids of these parents aren’t often permitted to have their own feelings, or think their own thoughts. Religion amplifies the message of obedience and respect towards parents, as do many unaware teachers and friends. What is truly leaving me stunned is I am suddenly realizing how much many of us survivors of crap parents depend on TV to look visually socialized and publicly ‘normalized’ (even if in our private lives no one doubts a therapist should be called). Many of the actors are also learning what so-called normalcy looks like as they go!Actors and viewers, the celebrities and the fans, the studios and producers - everybody perpetuating myths of happiness, gleeful cuteness, love and joy in America homes as shown by sitcoms. Yeah, yeah, I know some homes are for real on the spectrum of “normal”. But many homes are not. My head is exploding with thoughts. When dirt is swept under a rug, does it cure a house of filth? No. I am eternally grateful I was able to find and afford a therapist (insurance), and that I was willing to endure talking about it. Going to a therapist worked for me, and I really hope McCurdy sticks with it.The book is excellent. The writing is excellent. McCurdy’s journey is still continuing, though. I hope there will be another book. I highly recommend this one."
305,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1546297-jamie,Rating 5 out of 5,"My previous career was in advertising, which often required casting talent for TV commercials. On one particular visit to a casting agency, we were casting for the role of a young boy, 10-12 years old. The part was essentially for a ""Young Bill Gates,"" so we needed a young boy, bookish and nerdy. It was as you'd imagine, a lobby full of moms and sons (dressed in their finest nerdery), and us in a room as the casting agent called the children in one by one to read lines. Some were amazing, others clearly didn't want to be there or if they did, they were nervous to the point of paralysis. The whole thing made me very uncomfortable.Afterwards as I left with the director, we passed one of the moms on the street, berating her child to the chagrin of passers-by. This boy stared feebly at the ground while she yelled. I said, ""HI, THANKS FOR COMING IN!"" I spoke loudly, so she'd know we were watching and she clammed up and scuttled away with her child. I wish I could say she looked embarrassed, but to this day I've never forgotten how shameless she looked exploiting her kid.This book was an incredible, tragic, painful, darkly humorous look at the derangement of unstable parents who live their lives through their children--at the expense of their children.Will definitely recommend this to my book club."
306,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/110145648-katharine,Rating 1 out of 5,"I originally rated this book 2 stars, but have changed it to 1 star because of the scene where Jennette rapes her boyfriend. The more I think about it, the more upset I become from that part of the book. I was really excited to read this book; two ""booktubers"" that I'm fond of gave this book glowing 5 star reviews, so I was expecting to love this book and was very disappointed. The first turn off for me was the writing style. One thing that kept standing out to me was the habit of starting the majority of the chapters with quotations, which I personally find a bit childish, simply because I associate it with my childhood. Around 3rd grade my English teachers taught my class the importance of starting your stories/book/chapters in an exciting and intriguing way so people will be drawn in and want to read more, and the main thing they suggested to accomplish that was to start your chapters or short story with a quote. So even if it isn't actually a childish way to start a chapter, it just seems so to me, because that's how myself and all my peers were writing when we were children. I don't think I would've noticed it much in regards to Jennette's book, except for the fact that she was constantly doing it. In fact, practically every chapter seemed to follow the same formula. Start with a quote, then explain a bit more of what's going on in the scene, then mention the problematic/uncomfortable/abusive thing that her mother (or a different character) is doing to her in this scene, then end the chapter with a clever one-liner that relates to something written earlier in the chapter. It was so repetitive, it became really frustrating and annoying. I simply wish this book was written better. I've read a handful of reviews complaining about the amount/length of the chapters, and how it makes the book feel very disjointed and awkward and I'm afraid I agree. I wish Jennette took the time to try to write the book more as a whole, more cohesively, instead of dozens and dozens of chapters that are maybe 2 or 3 pages, setting the scene for one uncomfortable incident, and then moving on completely in the next chapter to a different unrelated scene. Surely there could've been a way to make it flow from one topic to another in a better way.  Anyways, another problem I had with the book is from pages 253-255, when she basically rapes her boyfriend, Steven. He tells her he doesn't want to have sex anymore, he doesn't want to be ""sinning like that anymore"", and he's taking a vow of celibacy. He states all of these points multiple times in the span of a minute or two. And what does Jennette do? She immediately forces him to partake in sex. And right afterwards he states again, multiple times that he doesn't want to do that. I'm surprised that more people don't mind this scene, but it really upsets me. I imagine if Steven were a female and Jennette were a male, people would be upset, but since the roles are reversed it's somehow not as bad? It's also so baffling to me because of how hypocritical Jennette is during that scene. It was bad enough already, but the fact is that Jennette states plenty of times that in previous relationships she didn't have sex because of her religion and how at that point in her life she still didn't want to have sex before marriage. Presumably all of her previous boyfriends/flings respected that because otherwise I feel certain she would've mentioned being raped and added it to the list of bad things that have happened to her (which, now that I think of it, this book does sometimes read like a list of ways people have wronged her). Yet, now the roles are reversed and it's her boyfriend who wants to stay abstinent because of religion, and it doesn't even cross her mind that she should respect that, particularly since she felt the same exact way just a year or two prior. You would think she would have such empathy for his feelings in this situation, but instead she completely violates him. She seemed to think that since he had a boner while they were kissing, that makes it ok because deep down he actually wanted to have sex. No, Jennette. That's not ok. And what makes it even crazier is that she seems to think that SHE'S the victim in this scene! She writes that she's not ok with his decision, that: ""My life is miserable right now. Sex is a reprieve. It's where I lose myself. I do not want to give up this shred of silver lining in my life"" And after she forces him into sex and he once again says he doesn't want to do it anymore, she finishes the chapter in a way that I think is supposed to make us feel bad for her. Are you kidding me? I wouldn't have minded if later in the book she realized how horrible she treated Steven in that moment, if she realized he was the victim, not herself. If she grew from that realization and apologized to him or SOMETHING. But there's none of that, and I'm left to believe that to this day she never realized that what she did was wrong and she still thinks that she was the victim in that moment.I do have other issues with the book, but this review is long enough, I don't think it's necessary for me to ramble on any more. I'm really glad that Jennette is doing better and I'm glad that so many people are enjoying this book."

Sì, è ovvio che è usato per catturare l’attenzione, ma ti prepara anche a quello che racconterà questo libro: la verità. Che sia difficile da digerire, complessa, non una lettura per tutti, questo è certo. Ma è tutte queste cose proprio perché Jennette Mccurdy è stata sincera in ogni parola, non ha cercato di abbellire o addolcire la realtà.In questo libro racconta la sua vita, ogni capitolo è una vignetta, ci presenta una scena dal suo punto di vista, ma non della Jennette del presente. Vediamo le scene dagli occhi della Jennette che quelle scene le vive, che non ha gli strumenti per comprendere quello che le sta accadendo, il che spezza ancora di più il cuore. Il filo rosso che collega tutti i capitoli è il rapporto dell’autrice con sua madre, anche dopo la sua morte. Sua madre era narcisista, con evidenti problemi e disordini mentali e alimentari, capace di manipolare sua figlia fin da piccolissima. Per questo Jennette aveva un rapporto quasi simbiotico con lei, aveva costantemente bisogno della sua approvazione, di renderla felice. Recitava per realizzare il sogno della madre, sviluppa disturbi alimentari, è costantemente sotto ai riflettori, in una situazione che odia ma che tutti le dicono che dovrebbe apprezzare perché “tutti vorrebbero essere al suo posto”. Spezza davvero il cuore vedere come una “scelta” che lei compie innocentemente, solamente per rendere felice sua madre, le toglierà l’occasione di crescere come una bambina normale. Non ho più tanto da dire. Non leggo tante biografie ma questa mi ha colpita. Mi ha colpito la sincerità di mostrare non una verità con la V maiuscola, ma una verità più sfaccettata e complessa, la sua verità. Questa donna ha una gran forza e sono contenta che ora abbia trovato la sua strada e la sua voce. "

Like the mom is washing them both...in the same shower. Its so awful to read about the control she exerts over her children. Her mom taught her how to be anorexic so she could stay ""child like"" to book younger roles and its like a weird bonding thing for her. They diet together and Jennette is 11 and wants her mom to be happy with her and god its so heartbreaking. Jennette truly felt like her mom was teaching her these things to help her. But help her what? Fulfill her mom's dreams of her being a child actor?Jennette was groomed. She wants so badly to please the people around her that when she is 18 she's dating much older men not recognizing how inappropriate it is and on top of that providing extensive emotional labor for these much older men and staying in the relationships because she doesn't want to hurt them if she leaves.

This is a huge story, I think Jennette did an amazing job at making you see how she loved her mom, but at the same time after her death it started her time to heal. She lived for and only for her mother, and all the abuse she received from the one person that is supposed to give your best is so hard to endure. I think the worst part, the most heartbreaking thing is to realise that the person you loved the most, the one you fought for so much to make you happy, the one you had as a model wasn’t good to you, that was actually abusing you and manipulating you all those years. I really hope Jennette got all the healing she deserves, and she’s at peace with herself and her mind. This was a sad and heartbreaking story, but definitely necessary. "

It feels weird to call a memoir that covers emotional abuse, manipulation, eating disorders, sexualization of children but the TV industry, and much more hilarious, but I think that's what made a story so dark readable. McCurdy has a sharp wit and a keen ability to take readers to the depths of what she experienced without leaving us feeling hopeless. Memoirs aren't usually my jam, and I wasn't of the right age to have watched McCurdy's show, but my lack of familiarity with her or her work didn't make this memoir any less compelling.

Pokazala jak naprawde wyglada kariera aktorki zza kulis. Jednak moja ""mala ja"" jest zla, ze ta historia ujrzala swiatlo dzienne. Kochalam te bajki, a teraz nigdy juz nie spojrze na nie w ten sam sposob. Jak cos co sprawialo mi frajde. Od dzis bede widziec tylko bol Jennette i jej wewnetrzny krzyk o pomoc."

I'm trying every day to face myself. The results vary, but the attempts are consistent.
Before I'm Glad My Mom Died started making the rounds on social media in 2022, I was basically unaware of Jennette McCurdy. I had a vague idea of iCarly (her breakout Nickelodeon hit) and I'd seen gifs, of course.But man, what a talented and insightful author! I'm so glad I read this.To make a long story short, Jennette was pushed, or rather shoved, into child acting by her narcissistic mother and along with that came heaps of abuse (emotional, verbal, physical, and sexual). She was forced to live her mother's dream of acting, her own wants and needs be damned. Her mother's constant guilt tripping and manipulation meant that Jennette's own desires were tertiary - being an adorable actress who could cry on cue was more important.
I was conditioned to believe any boundary I wanted was a betrayal of her, so I stayed silent. Cooperative.
As with any memoir detailing an abusive childhood, this was hard to read. To us as adults reading it, it's obvious that a LOT of messed up things are happening. The writing is able to toe this deft line where she writes about herself as a child with the benefit of adult perspective and clear sense of 'this is wrong,' without losing the very childlike desire of simply wanting to make her mother happy.A good memoir should have a compelling story, and yeah, this does. But it's just as much about the way the author chooses to TELL it that makes it a successful read. She's honest and wryly funny and has a great voice. And I mean both literary voice and speaking voice; she does a wonderful job narrating. Going with the audiobook of this was 100% the correct choice.It's clear that writing is a talent of hers that is natural, but also one that she's nourished, and one that she cares about deeply.
I like the privacy of it. Nobody’s watching. Nobody’s judging. Nobody’s weighing in. No casting directors or agents or managers or directors or Mom. Just me and the page. Writing is the opposite of performing to me. Performing feels inherently fake. Writing feels inherently real.
If you're a nonfiction / memoir reader (and are comfortable reading about a lot of sensitive and potentially upsetting stuff, particularly about eating disorders,) I can easily recommend I'm Glad My Mom Died. It's a book brimming with emotional honesty and personal growth, written by someone who clearly dedicated a lot of time and emotional space to writing this daring, cathartic memoir."

321,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/81557299-beary-into-books,Rating 5 out of 5,"Reading this book really comforted me. Hearing someone else share their struggles, the good and the bad, let me know I’m not alone. I could really relate to a lot of what she went through. Jennette McCurdy was so honest in what she shared. This book wasn’t easy to listen to but it was definitely worth it. I would 100% recommend this one to everyone. Also, I found it to be extremely well written and the way it was told was like a story. At times I had to remind myself that this wasn’t fiction. "
322,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14321329-christina-pilkington,Rating 5 out of 5,"I had to jump on the hype train and read Jennette McCurdy's memoir even though I have never watched any of her TV series or movies. And it really was a moving, honest memoir. She doesn't sugar coat anything. Her language is raw and blunt and packs a huge punch. I appreciated McCurdy's descriptions of the abuse she went though and how her thoughts about that abuse changed as she grew older. She perceived things her mother said and did to her as being out of love and concern when as a reader I could only feel horrified at what was happening. It's not easy to think of yourself as a victim or an abuse survivor, so to see Jennette come to terms with that (something I think she still needs to work on) was a powerful journey to read. If you can be in the right head space for this, and if you can read vivid descriptions of eating disorders and parental abuse by gaslighting and emotional manipulation, this is a memoir that will stick with you for a long time. Also, I'd highly recommend listening to this one on audio as Jennette reads her story herself. "
323,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27332846-jessica,Rating 4 out of 5,"this was fantastic. heart wrenching and hard hitting, accessible but difficult to read. if you've somewhat kept up with jennette mccurdy and you're around my age (early 20s) then you're probably aware of her story. you were probably young and watching icarly and then consequently grew up into someone who realized how destructive the entertainment industry is on children. jennette was failed as a child, but the focus on familial abuse instead of industrial abuse is important in its own right too.i'm grateful that she is telling her story and i'm glad she's doing better now. i hope writing this book was therapeutic for her. thank you to the publisher and netgalley for providing my review copy"
324,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/128466586-dylan-nathanson,Rating 5 out of 5,"Pov I finally finished the semester and am now reading everything I’ve put off for the past 6 monthsAnyways this was great. McCurdy tells her story with so much heart and wit, revealing her deepest struggles and taking us with her on the journey of healing and coping with her past. It reads super easily and I was able to sit down and read it in one sitting with no problems. Also, even though Jennette’s story is incredible personal to her, so many elements of her experiences are perfect representations of every mother-daughter relationship and the chronicles of growing into teenhood/adulthood, from the extremes to the smallest shared experiences. It’s jarring and dark but so honest and hopeful. So deserving of alllllll the praise"
325,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6320671-cortney---the-bookworm-myrtle-beach,Rating 4 out of 5,"Child stars get dealt a really bad hand... this book was just another example of that. I think maybe because I didn't have any real recognition of her, and I didn't grow up watching her, that it was missing that extra ""OMG"" that everyone seems to feel about this book, but I don't really get all the fanfare.I commend her for being honest, and realizing how traumatic and toxic her life was, but I feel like it was all pretty much surface stuff... she didn't really delve into anything, including the realization that she was actually glad her mom died (though to be honest, she is better off)Still glad I read it. 4 stars."

I used to think that she, and all those young stars, had it made. Who wouldn't want to be them? Were they not living the dream?Truly, this was eye-opening and horrifying to think that Jannette, and possibly many other young people, could be living such painful lives right before our eyes.It must have taken bravery to write this novel. I am glad that she found that strength and was able to heal from the things she was made to live through."
327,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62481264-au-ur,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book was not on my radar and came to me through recommendations here on Goodreads and I'm so grateful for that. This was a raw heartfelt read and I can't recommend it enough. The biggest takeaway for me was how dangerous it is to try to live our unfulfilled dreams through our kids, insted of letting them blossom in to there own wants and needs. Highly recommend the audiobook for this one as it is read by Jannette McCurdy."

Nie będę dawać gwiazdek, bo nie będę oceniać czyjejś krzywdy. Nie dziwię się, że jest szczęśliwa z tego, że jej mama umarła."
