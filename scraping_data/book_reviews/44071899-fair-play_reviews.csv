We‚Äôve read The Power as well as Catch and Kill at the same time, engaged in some pretty awesome conversations, and then she insisted I read Fair Play as well. Fair Play is written for a very specific audience, and it‚Äôs also written for women. More specifically, it‚Äôs written for moms, and, even more specially, it‚Äôs written for moms with husbands and kids. I‚Äôm sure partners with or without kids could find value here as well, but the target audience is busy moms who take on a lot of mental and physical work, which includes my wife. The ideas here are great, but this book is ultimately fluffed up with too much filler and anecdotes to give it length without substance. I did gleam some nuggets os useful information and nodded in agreement with the author‚Äôs main premise. I had the chance to classify myself as a ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the Butter?‚Äù husband mixed with a few other stereotypes. I learned what extra planning and conceptualizing goes into day-to-day activities that often go unnoticed by me, as I am often trying to find the butter. The idea of the game is cool, but I didn‚Äôt need a chapter that explained each section or each square and what it meant with examples. I didn‚Äôt need dozens of stories and quotes from other people. I didn‚Äôt need the redundancy. This could have been much shorter, but I get it. You can‚Äôt sell an idea or a one page instruction sheet. I get it. So tonight I‚Äôm gonna help me friend move a couch. He‚Äôs going to pay me in wings that are not plant-based and bourbon. I‚Äôm going to come back home with a full stomach and a lighter head, I‚Äôm going to sit down at my kitchen table, and I‚Äôm going to play Fair Play. I‚Äôm going to CPE the hell out of all of the cards I get. I‚Äôm going to find my Unicorn Space and keep giving myself self-care. I‚Äôm gonna destroy this game, and my wife and I will live happier lives. Then, I‚Äôm gonna find the damn butter. "
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8851570-lisa,Rating 2 out of 5,"An interesting book, and somewhat comforting to read. As a DINK I don't have a lot of these issues talked about in the book, but it has struck me that even though I have a full time job, with a half hour commute on either end, I end up doing all the housework, grocery shopping, meal execution, household repairs, budgeting, etc. while my husband uses his spare time to volunteer, attend political forums, have coffee ""meetings"" with every mover and shaker in the city, and play on his Ipad. And get cranky when dinner is not planned, or when he is forced to eat leftovers two night in a row instead of having fresh food made for him. So I was excited to get an ARC of this book.I felt a lot of sympathy for the author, and the other women discussed in the book, as I could see flashes of myself in them, and I actually was (again) SOOOOOOO grateful for the fact that I don't have any children, because there is no way I could deal with those hassles. However, although the author clearly came from a background that should make her empathetic of single working mothers, her book only applies to a married couple. A married couple with a decent amount of education and money, with fairly traditional jobs. I couldn't see how a single parent of several children, who receives minimal support from their former partner, who may be working multiple minimum wage jobs would be able to participate in this card game. Which struck me as odd, since this scenario is very similar to the way the author claims she was raised. She talks her head off about Unicorn Space, but I know full well that working single mothers DO NOT HAVE THE TIME OR RESOURCES to partake in such a thing, not matter how much Eve Rodsky insists they can. Despite the fact that at the beginning of the book she makes a vague promise that she interviewed people across racial and socioeconomic backgrounds, I did not once see evidence of this in any of her proposed solutions. This book is obviously meant to appeal to white, upper middle class, college educated women, which is fine, but that leaves a majority of women out of the conversation, including myself. I wish it had attempted to appeal to a wider audience, especially since there were points made that really struck me. For example, I think the idea of Unicorn Space is a great idea for me, since I haven't pursued it much since I got married. Luckily, I don't have kids, and I have enough in savings to take it on. I also like that she points out that we should all strive to remain interesting instead of becoming stagnant and stuck, but again, this point falls flat to a parent living on the edge of homelessness, trying to get their family from one hour to the next, praying that a missed day of work will not derail them.It will find an audience, but it won't be me, or anyone I know."

3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1947301-ericka-clou,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book is only for two-parent homes struggling to find a balance in at-home responsibilities. There were a lot of things it left unaddressed- such as workaholic spouses, or as numerous reviews stated, any kind of lower-class home (where for example maybe one person works a night shift). If you want it only for that very limited area, it's helpful.I happen to have a husband who is not only doing a fair amount but might also be doing an equal amount (or more?). But one thing I've noticed in my friends' relationships-- that this book addresses (though perhaps not clearly enough) is that many mothers take on a bunch of tasks that are actually not at all important to their husbands. I think the reason I notice this so much is because I'm not the type of mother who feels like we need to craft for every holiday or decorate to excess or aggressively participate in my children's homework etc. I have ""husband standards"" for many things. So when I see a friend who is a mother sign each of her kid up for three activities and then bemoan that her husband won't help with all of them- I silently agree with the husband. Her standard is just too high in my opinion. That's why I think the most valuable part of this book is the part where she makes couples agree on their values and what tasks need to get done before they apportion those tasks. The more tasks you can just completely take off the list so that neither person has to do them, the better, in my opinion.I've been recommending this book to people I know might benefit from it."
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27151080-jordyn-gier,Rating 1 out of 5,"I had to stop reading this half way in. She does an extremely unfair job of portraying a man's contribution in the household. The most laughable part to me was when she was splitting up their lists of ""shit they do"" and gave each of her tasks sub-points. She gave herself ""taking care of the pet"" and there were several sub-points to the extent of buying the dog food, taking them to vet appointments, etc. Meanwhile, she gave her husband 1) manage the finances and 2) cars and maintenance. TWO THINGS. WHAT?! Taking care of the pet gets a list of sub-points and managing the household finances gets ONE??? Does she understand what all goes into this? I don't know.. just didn't like the light that she shined on what her husband contributed and felt she was coming from a place of man-hating that I can't exactly relate to. "
5,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Before reading Fair Play, I wondered what would happen to my children if I died. Would they grow up in squalor, never having their hair combed and teeth brushed, or clean clothes to wear? Would they never see the doctor or dentist again for their regular check-ups? After reading Fair Play, I realized that of course not‚Ä¶my kids would be absolutely fine, because my husband is a reasonable and smart man, and thus, he would simply remarry. Simply stated, Fair Play is about equitably restructuring the domestic division of labor, a complex topic that has been discussed in-depth for decades, but without a revolutionary, systematic resolution, until now. However, before diving headfirst into the depths of this discussion, we would be remiss if we did not acknowledge that this topic of domestic workload overlaps multiple social constructs: sexuality, race, gender, and class. These varying degrees of intersecting socially constructed identities make for real life consequences and differences for those occupying these identities. For example, a white, wealthy, cisgender woman in a heterosexual marriage will have a very different experience than a black, impoverished, transwoman in a same gender marriage. In sum, when you add various social identities together, there are increased odds of having specific types of advantaging or disadvantaging experiences, producing inequity (oppression or privilege) that is compounded over time. However, these differences that our social identities bring into the equation are not what keep us divided. Our refusal to acknowledge these differences and the resulting differences in our oppressions in ways that motivate us to think about and to act against inequity maintains and widens the divisions. It takes compassion, self-awareness and critical consciousness to identify the similarities that exist within our lives across differences while also interrogating the inequities and injustices upon which this country was founded. The topic of domestic division of labor allows us to do both. The opposite of oppression is equity, justice, or fairness, rather than equality. Equity is the result of a humanizing process that takes into consideration individual circumstances and the differential effects of sociopolitical contexts; whereas equality ignores precipitating, historical and causal factors and only focuses on equal input. Courage and honest dialogue with open-minded listening are required to step up to difficult conversations about past and current injustice, which is the first step out of inequity. Beware of deflection strategies that perpetuate the cycle of inequity. Deflection strategies divert attention from pertinent ideas and actions to irrelevant issues. One deflection strategy is the belief in myths such as the 24-hour woman or the work-life balance. We are taught to believe the impossible is attainable. Inevitably, when we fall short, we blame our shortcomings for failure. We believe there‚Äôs something wrong with us rather than fault the myth. Setting the goal for perfection sets everyone up for failure: obviously, a no win situation. The main take away from Fair Play that I received is that we can all win if we play this game of life fairly. In an inequitable system of patriarchy men are more likely to receive systemic advantages over women that may increase their sociopolitical, economic standings to a 7 on the accomplishment scale of 1 ‚Äì 10; and, women, because of systemic disadvantage, may be at a 4 on that same scale. If we partner to fight for equity, then we can all be at a 9. An equitable system benefits everyone. We all have something to gain and no one has to lose. Equity creates a win-win.There‚Äôs a historical context and a sociopolitical climate that allows the current division of domestic workload to exist. Fair Play brings into focus the role that macro-systems (i.e., culture, norms, mores) play within micro contexts and the cyclical relationship between the public and private sphere, such that, private troubles become public problems and public issues become private struggles. Culture, systems, and policies manifest at the intrapersonal level ‚Äì that is, within our individual thoughts and behaviors, such as prejudices and discrimination ‚Äì as well as within our interpersonal relationships. External values invade our homes, controlling our way of domestic life, such that our homes are microcosms of American culture and society. Redistributing the domestic workload requires a paradigm shift from the inequitable practices that occur outside our homes to standards of equity within our homes. Fair Play gives us permission to create our own values that introduce equity into our households, creating an equitable shift in domestic workload, and setting examples for our children: that is the revolution. Once working towards equity in our private lives, then it‚Äôs time to take the fight public to address the socio-structural issues that have squatted for too long in our homes, adversely possessing our minds, relationships and time. It‚Äôs important to remember that the issue is not men against women or wives versus husbands. Our partners are not the enemy. It‚Äôs not a revolution if we‚Äôre fighting each other - rather the fight should be between us and the systems of inequity. Mothers and fathers can work together to transform the system. United households can advocate for affordable childcare options and employment policies that support families. ‚ÄúIn a world of possibility for us all, our personal visions help lay the groundwork for political action‚Äù (Audre Lorde, p. 112). The sum of our individual differences should not divide us on issues regarding our collective liberation.Fair Play was not written in a vacuum void of sociopolitical realities. The research in Fair Play was done with due diligence, remaining cognizant of the fact that social science research tends to have samples with people who have dominant social identities (e.g., heterosexual, white). Those samples seem to reflect the identities of those conducting the research. With this in mind, Fair Play had a respectable sample size of 507 people; 37% were people of color. Although Fair Play was not authored by a social science researcher, the sample is probably more diverse than many research studies about the gender division of labor, which suggests that Fair Play has a wider applicability. Although it is difficult to write for a broad audience, Fair Play acknowledges that we share similar experiences across social identities and the inequitable division of labor affects us all. Everyone‚Äôs personal situation is nuanced and complex. Thus, the effect of this issue will be different, but the issue remains the same. Regardless of one‚Äôs positionality on the social hierarchy, the Fair Play system can provide insight and apply to your particular circumstances. We can start a revolution within our households, sweep the public sphere clean of social norms and cultural mores that uphold inequitable domestic labor practices, producing a ripple effect to future generations, thus, transforming America one marriage at a time. The worst thing we can tell ourselves and our children is: ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just the way it is,‚Äù because the way it is, doesn‚Äôt have to be. We make the choice to maintain or change with every action or non-action. Here‚Äôs a thought experiment for you while you read Fair Play: Imagine what could be different about you, your relationships and the world, if we collectively decided to play fair. "
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2572351-moira,Rating 2 out of 5,"This is the October @reesesbookclub selection. As a single woman who lives alone, I did not relate to this book. I find this to be such a miss for RBC as it really alienated me. This was clearly a vanity project for the author and I disliked the tone of several of her statements. I found the game to be confusing, and so much of it is based on your perceived opinions of your partner that I can‚Äôt imagine this would actually go over well. Maybe if I was at a different point in life this book would have been more beneficial. "
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3371659-snem,Rating 1 out of 5,"I‚Äôm hesitant to say too much about this or rate it because I‚Äôm not the intended audience. As such I‚Äôm surprised Reese Witherspoon would select a book that alienates a large percentage of her book club readers. This book did make me appreciate all that parents, in particular moms, do. If I didn‚Äôt want kids or marriage before I certainly don‚Äôt want it now. This sealed the deal.This is hetero-normative and gendered to the hilt and that‚Äôs a real missed opportunity. While same sex couples are mentioned here and there, really examining how non-traditional households handle the never ending to-do list would have been interesting. Also what about exploring the division of labor in the households of other cultures? I‚Äôm sorry but words like ‚Äúsystemization‚Äù and ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù and ‚Äúexpectations‚Äù appear throughout this. Doesn‚Äôt that make marriage and family sound fun and joyous? Yuck! And no amount of ‚Äúit‚Äôs a card game! It‚Äôs so fun‚Äù is going to change my opinion from yuck. Again, I recognize that I‚Äôm not the audience for this. If you‚Äôre an overwhelmed and underappreciated parent, perhaps give this a read you might get a lot more out of it than I did. "
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/129245-jasmine,Rating 5 out of 5,"The most important thing to note about this book is that it is for women who live with a man (married, most likely) and have one or more children. If that is you and you have the feeling that you are handling a bunch of unseen and unappreciated work around the house, READ THIS BOOK. *note: check out the website fairplaylife.com for her COVID times toolkit*I was familiar with the concept of emotional labor and the unequal division of work (especially caregiving tasks--doctor's appointments, anyone?) but none of that previous reading went any further than describing the issue. Fair Play not only lays out the common tasks required to keep a house going these days, it provides a framework for discussing them and fully releasing some of them to your partner. It also does a good job of calling out some of the things that women can do that keep the majority of these tasks on their plate.I implemented the recommendations in my own household, and it's been really awesome. The initial conversation wasn't exactly fun, but it was well worth it. Highly recommend!"
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7008646-rachel,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book was a game changer. I feel bad for all the negative reviews. I feel being a Reese‚Äôs book club pick did a disservice to this book. It resulted in a lot of people reading this book who shouldn‚Äôt have. In other words not the target audience. If you‚Äôre not the target audience to a ‚Äúself-help‚Äù book then don‚Äôt read it, it‚Äôs not for you, and for God sakes, don‚Äôt give it a bad review. Of course it wasn‚Äôt helpful, it wasn‚Äôt meant to help you - it was meant to help someone in a completely different stage of life.With that being said. On the surface most of this feels like common sense. But when you‚Äôre in the heat of the moment of everyday life, you don‚Äôt really think of it on your own. So this information wasn‚Äôt something completely new that was a groundbreaking discovery. It was a light bulb that has been broken finally getting fixed and turning on for the first time. A ‚Äúwell duh, that makes sense‚Äù moment. A self actualization, a relationship development, a change of habit that completely changed our life."
10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/103170057-marie-comeau,Rating 2 out of 5,"Picked up this book because of Reese‚Äôs bookclub. Although there was obviously a lot of research done and she does point out some good points. It sounds like she wants to impose this ‚Äúgame‚Äù to their marriage, delegate while still supervising tasks instead of making the relationship a true partnership.What gave this book only two stars was the tone.Men are trash, woman are superior. Husband, if you don‚Äôt play this game, our whole marriage is at risks. She also make you put labels on yourself and your partner.There‚Äôs too many good books out there about communication, vulnerability and partnerships that makes you feel empowered but also shine a positive light.This book simply made me feel angry and made me think things about my partner that are not truly happening the way the author tries to make it seems."
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51930427-mary,Rating 2 out of 5,"I appreciate what Rodsky is trying to do, but so much of this feels like overkill to me. There's really no need for a game this complicated--it's clearly the author's passion project, but it's essentially just a tool to help couples communicate better. I found much of her approach to be a.) frustratingly heteronormative and b.) frustratingly infantilizing of men (and enabling of this kind of infantilization, which feels like a double whammy). Maybe my husband and I are a bit of a unique situation: when you have a kid with special needs, it's all-hands-on-deck, all the time, and maybe I just truly hit the husband lottery, but I felt like our relationship has developed a natural rhythm and distribution of labor based on a.) who has more bandwidth at any given time and b.) solid communication strategies. I appreciated some of what Rodsky discusses in this book, like the importance of establishing a ""minimum standard of care,"" and differentiating between equality and equity in the division of household labor. And maybe this book isn't all-or-nothing, and couples can pick and choose what works for them and what they need. But to me, it felt like major overkill. "
12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22299570-kaytee-cobb,Rating 2 out of 5,"I thought this was interesting but ocelot idealistic. I think it would be useful for two full time working patents to go through this game together and play, but for SAHM, which Rodsky says she is also (mostly?) talking to, I think the most important message here is: make time for self care, adult relationships, and ""unicorn space"". And have your partner get on board with that. There, i just saved you having to read this book."
13,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"Oh my goodness! I could not finish this book! It is one long, angry rant about all that needs to be done to have a marriage, family, and home run smoothly and harmoniously. Please tell me it's a joke!Granted, my family is raised, my marriage is happy, and our home functions smoothly; so I'm looking BACK on the the busy, never-ending list of tasks from a different perspective. Evidently the author felt like she has to do everything and the husband just goes to work and comes home and relaxes. Her solution is to write down every single task on 100 different cards and expect them to be divided equally between partners and executed to HER standards. She has categories, the most offensive being ‚ÄúDaily Grind‚Äù with such precious ‚Äútasks‚Äù as reading with your child or tucking her into bed.I refuse to believe that men today are as self-centered and blind to the workings of a smooth-running marriage and family as they were in the 50s. Men do change diapers, cook meals, take & pick up children, do the laundry, and share the responsibilities. I can't imagine any spouse being agreeable to having 50 cards ‚Äúassigned‚Äù to them with guaranteed blame attached if the task is not completed. It would be difficult to find a sane person who could have a harmonious relationship with a person as ‚Äúnit picky‚Äù as this to take the precious time to make up the 100 cards! It's a recipe for disaster. A calm discussion early in the relationship about what makes a happy home and family and supporting each other toward that goal for a lifetime seems much more effective."

I love parenting books, I love self-help and relationship books and as soon as I saw the premise of this I knew I needed to read it ASAP!The adjustment to parenthood did not happen super easily for us both personally and in our relationship together. It was a huge transition and we struggled in many ways as we navigated our new roles and expectations of one another.‚ÄúOn many days, feeling the full weight of exhaustion that would seize me the moment my baby was down and I was finally offline, I‚Äôd wonder What did I do all day? When even I couldn‚Äôt answer the question, there was no doubt in my mind that I‚Äôd lost all control of my time. Sound familiar?‚ÄùWhile we have learned a lot as the years have gone by, figuring out the daily logistics of life with work, marriage, kids and our household tasks is a constant juggling act. Fair Play both takes on and tackles the topics of the mental load, second shift, emotional labor and invisible work that in the 21st century still cause a great imbalance in many family‚Äôs home lives.Not only is Eve Rodsky‚Äôs writing accessible and totally relatable, but it is also helpful! I love a good plan. I feel the absolute worst when life feels tough and I don‚Äôt know what my next steps are going to be. Even when things are still rocky, when I am moving forward, things always feel more manageable.Rodsky created a simple and straightforward approach to help equitably restructuring the balance of domestic ‚Äúduties‚Äù while also factoring in time to focus on creative and personal growth so that everyone feels fulfilled and happy.While our relationship does follow a similar path as Rodsky‚Äôs (heterosexual married couple with kids) she has also done her due diligence. Rodsky worked with 500+ couples to include a wide variety of multiple social constructs which can alter perspectives, challenges, and accessibility so this book really is for everyone!Her Q&A on her own website is super informative if you are looking to learn more about why she took on this project. Resources like this are so awesome to help raise awareness of these important conversations that are so important to navigating family life.Thank you to Putnam for sending this amazing book mail and to Edelweiss for an ARC ebook edition."

Don't get me wrong, I am all about equalizing housework and it's something my spouse and I have argued about for years, but this approach seems like the absolute wrong way to go about it. It seems excessively aggressive and fight-y and high strung. Her approach to her spouse seems pretty antagonistic and her laundry list of things that she does seems way too long. And then setting up cards of stuff to do would make me go nuts. Maybe some people like to work this way, but I would rebel if you presented me with a ""system"" this rigid for dividing household labor."

It stuck right to the heart of what so many women I know are dealing with as they strive for balance in career and family, always on the brink of falling off the edge. What if we had the opportunity to balance the scales at home? What if my husband and I decided to plan out the division of labor at home before we had kids? What if I could actually quantify my domestic workload and give my husband more than his 4%?

I loved how practical the book is and the author's tips for how to phrase conversation starters. I don't totally agree with the tactic she recommends of having only one person own each household task completely, and I feel like the author also didn't address how the time earning an income should factor into household responsibilities. But overall this was great food for thought and I think will bring about some great conversations in my home."
23,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/119814060-stephanie,Rating 4 out of 5,"I really enjoyed this book - so much so that even though I listened to it for free from the library, I'm going to buy a physical copy to annotate it and pull quotes.I found myself nodding along as I was driving to and from work‚Ä¶ and yes, getting angry. Because the facts ARE anger-inducing! Women are the ""she-fault"" (default) to domestic tasks and the cognitive labor of running a household. Women naturally take on more chores, take on the mental load of unseen work, are expected to assign out work to their partners like a project manager, and then get blamed for being a ""nag"". UGH. While reading, I started asking women I know in real life about the split of their domestic work with their husbands. I also posted a not-super-nice Instagram story about my own husband after going to pack my lunch one morning and realizing he hadn't closed the Triscuit box properly, meaning they all went stale. And I got a ton of examples from women of shit their spouses do that piss them off or are ridiculous to them.I couldn't help but wonder, as I was talking to all this women and reading the Fair Play book‚Ä¶ are men really so much less capable than women? Of being self-sufficient, of multi-tasking, or taking on work and domestic tasks? Are all men wielding weaponized incompetence - pretending to be bad at something to get out of doing it in the future? Or, are men truly blind to the work that goes into keeping a household running? While Fair Play scientifically knocks down the myth that women are better at multi-tasking or more suited to domestic chores, I do think both weaponized incompetence and blissful ignorance play a role in why today, even when women work outside the home (and even when women are the breadwinners / higher earners in their families) - they are still expected to act like a housewife.I wish Fair Play went a BIT more into weaponized incompetence vs blissful ignorance and how to combat both (I read The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work as a companion book to this and found a lot of good information on how to actually get through to your spouse on solvable problems and perpetual problems) - but that wasn't really the purpose of this book and I get it. I just enjoyed Eve Rodsky's voice and research, and I think she could have made this interesting. Maybe one day she'll come out with a book on marriage and communication! The second half of this book goes into detail on the Fair Play game. The basics: you need to define what tasks/chores are ""musts"" in your home. You need to define a minimum standard of care - the basis for completing the task successfully. You need to assign value to each one - how important it is for your home. You need to split the cards. And re-deal. And re-deal. And re-deal. I fully see the merit in these cards and the game. It makes visible all the mental labor that goes into each task. When you hold a card (a chore, task, etc) you own the conception, planning, and execution. No reminders, no help, no delegating. If you want to see the cards, check out the Fair Play website - they're all listed on there with a description of each. (A Reddit forum I found talking about the game actually discouraged from buying the physical cards because they said you still have to go to the website for the DETAILS on each card - apparently they're not printed on there.) Do I think that the game will work for every couple? No. For my husband and I, who are currently childless and pet-less (RIP Lucy), working full time, living in a small two bedroom condo‚Ä¶ we really wouldn't have a big deck of cards. Also, based on our current work schedules, it just isn't feasible to have one person in charge of dishes (all rinsing, loading, unloading) - unless we're okay with dishes in the sink for days at a time (and I'm not). There's also ground work needed for some of the cards. Sadly, my husband cannot cook. I mean, I'm not a great cook but I can figure it out. That's something we have to work on before I feel comfortable asking him to plan meals or make weeknight dinners. I'm not having a burger every night! Personally, I really enjoyed this book for the information and context it provided. I will take the SPIRIT of this book and apply it to my life. I'm sure Eve advises against this and I fully get it - but at the end of the day you need to do what'll work for your relationship in the present. I'm hopeful that in the future we can fully ""deal"" cards that each of us will own, entirely.¬†"

I can't speak for everyone, but for most of my friends and my relationship, the scale never seems balanced when it comes to taking care of the place called home(and the children or fur babies). Fair Play presents a plan for a more even distribution of the myriad of tasks that have to be dealt with on an ongoing basis. It is written in a thought-provoking and engaging way, that may lead to some well-needed adult conversations. Too often, arguments ensue when people are frustrated, and I can see how taking the emotion out of the conversation, and approaching it logically, as you would at work, can lead to a better outcome. That may be the hardest part of trying to improve the situation at home, but after all, we would all agree that running a home and having a family is a second job, so why not treat it the way you treat your paying job? It is well- researched, well thought out, and may well save a relationship or two. This book gave me quite a lot to think about and I am eager to see where it takes me.

27,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/128173948-colleen,Rating 1 out of 5,"Recommend? Not a chance.Rodsky's gleams success from this book because it hits home for so many women of our time.As a mother myself, I understand Rodsky's perspective and she does make some valid arguments such as our culture needing to change its realistic views on motherhood so women can feel valued at home or at work, so longer maternity leaves can take place like other countries already practice, and so more fathers can participate in domestic duties. She and her girlfriends create a list of all the things mothers must do for their household to run successfully and makes each item on the list a physical card. Even reading to your child at night is a card from the list. Then, she and her husband pick the cards they must do - fairly evening out the work. I have many gripes with all of this. First is that she creates this ""system"" out of spite and anger. She has a huge chip on her shoulder toward her husband and perhaps the role of husbands and fathers alike. She reiterates the message that our society is constantly shoving down our throats: husbands and fathers are good for nothing, lazy, and mothers do it all. I don't believe this to be the majority of husbands and fathers at all; many are doing very noble work both in and outside their homes. Second, not to mention her interviewed population of husband and wives is a biased sample - they all have the same answers. I can't help but think that some women like Rodsky feel this way because they are burnt out and wanting control of it all - desiring fulfillment in their careers, building their own reputations, competing for the latest gadgets in our materialistic world - while raising a family. I am not sure you can have it all without all of it falling a part. She does interview stay-at-home moms too - and again all seem to also lack fulfillment by making this choice to sacrifice themselves for their families. How sad! I simply can't believe that this is a true representation of parents in our country today. If this is the case, why is anyone having kids?!Third, I am shocked that people find this book to be a surprise on Reese Witherspoon's book club list. This audience the book targets is exactly her audience to whom she also caters - the white, upper class, working woman who is heterosexual though supports liberal ideologies. This describes Reese Witherspoon herself, does it not? This book is for the classic, nuclear family, which bothers many readers today. Yet, this is still the real, widespread, and common family of our times. Fourth, her ideas could have been summed up in one chapter instead of a length of a book. Still, I do not think healthy marriages especially those with children will benefit in reading this or partaking in this fair play game. If we want attitudes and expectations of mothers to change, it needs to begin in our homes by teaching our children to value all parts of family life, so we then raise men and women to see their domestic duties as sacred and the utmost dignified work ... not a drain on anyone's ""unicorn space"" or trying to be a more ""interesting"" person. C'mon, Eve. That is selfish nonsense. I propose that you share some serious conversations with your spouse to tackle life together, be a team, do your roles (and the work that comes with those roles well), ask for help when you need it, and love your family above all else.Fifth, to say that these roles will be ""fair"" is unrealistic. A larger issue that this book fails to acknowledge is the reality that moms and dads have fundamentally different roles and different types of work that they must do for their family simply because one or the other cannot offer what the opposite sex can to their child. It has been this way since the beginning of time. Though again, many today will argue otherwise. Who really thinks that all husbands/dads can write thank you notes, plan parties, and always produce thoughtful gifts? Some of this ordinary work that is so draining to Rodsky is a glimpse of the feminine genius that women offer to the world. This book is an absolute blow to Rodsky's single mother who had to do it all without complaint and of course, her husband. Again, this is simply selfish nonsense. All in all, I am not saying women can't work, but I am saying that parents need to be realistic and there will be some sacrifice whether that means the father or mother hiring help, going part-time, or staying home. You can do this without becoming a dictator and taskmaster like she suggests, especially toward your husband. It's not about keeping score or being in control between you and your spouse. The ultimate result will show in the people you raise. You must model selflessly loving one another in the ordinary work that mothers and fathers are simply tasked to do."

31,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63602401-leah-agirlandaboy,No Rating,"Oh, I have thoughts.---The author refers to something called a ""compliment sandwich,"" in which you say two nice things on either side of a not-so-nice thing. Where I come from (aka the planet Earth), this is always called a ""shit sandwich"" (because sandwiches are named after what's *between* the bread, yo), and that is how I'll serve up this review.Bread: I kind of liked the first part, which is mostly statistics and evidence about how it is that women end up carrying most of the mental load of running a home. Even though this was validating, it all felt like an afterthought. I suspect Rodsky wrote the book she wanted to write--focused only on the Fair Play system--but then, because it was a little thin and mostly based on vibes, padded it via the help of writing assistants who sought out research to support the points she wanted to make. She thanks her assistants for doing such a fine job of this, but here is me giving the side-eye to the idea that the way to support a claim is to go looking for ""proof"" (mostly short-form articles from popular sources on the internet) to support your claims. This is not how research works if you want to be taken seriously (rather, you need to survey the big picture, not just cherry-pick), but anyhow, it's not like we need studies to tell us that women carry the burden of household management, so let's move on. Shit: Okay, so, I'm not the audience for this book, and while I can concede that *in theory* this way of looking at things *might* be helpful to *some* people (especially SAHMs with ""traditional"" husbands who don't think they should have any responsibilities beyond going to work (and maybe their wives have always thought that too)), it was frustrating to see how often the system just didn't make sense and in fact often reinforced the problems it said it wanted to overcome (e.g., the woman is still organizing and enforcing the system!). It was interesting, for instance, that whenever a task fell through the cracks, it was always the woman's fault (either she didn't give the man better instructions or she asked too much of him or she didn't plan her own day better), while if a man fails to complete his task to the agreed-upon quality standard, the best solution is to either eliminate the task (""Sorry, kids, no more attending friends' birthday parties"") or else *take that task away from him and give it to the woman*. OH HO HO WHAT A GREAT SYSTEM FOR ONE OF THESE PEOPLE. I mean, come on. Also, it's beyond ludicrous to say that if a task is ""yours"" it means you shouldn't ever ask your partner to do even one tiny piece of it (say, pick something up at the store while they're out), and if you truly need help with a portion of a task, you should ask *anyone other than your husband* to do it. !!! I cannot. And that's without even mentioning that this weird rule flies in the face of one of the main goals of the system, which is supposedly ""efficiency."" (The mainest of the main goals is ""stay married,"" which...eh, sometimes you shouldn't? Especially if your path to getting there is, as this book seems to suggest, finding the inflection point at which the man is doing the absolute minimum amount of work necessary at which the woman will not to leave him in a burned-out rage. I'm begging you to aim higher, ladies.) Anyway, this book has a fun twist if you can find it: buried in the acknowledgments is confirmation of the fact that the author has a nanny--a fucking nanny!--aka a third adult (one who is not an equal partner but a gofer awaiting orders) to pick up slack in all those times when two adults aren't enough. Did you guess it? A nanny! (No shade to nannies and nanny-having people, but don't tell me the Fair Play system will revolutionize your partnership without also telling me you have a third, subordinate, paid adult in the mix.)Bread: I did find it useful to see written out in detail just how much it takes to keep a home and family running (smoothly or otherwise). I really can't imagine this system *not* creating extra levels of chaos and score-keeping and blame (sidebar: whoa nelly does this author seem to resent a lot of people in her life, from children needing basic caretaking, to family inviting her to celebratory events, to schools sending informational emails about optional activities), but maybe I'm just expecting too much. Rodsky reminds us, after all, that while it might be nice to have a completely fair (which is different from ""equal"") distribution of labor, we should be happy if the man in our life takes even *one* card off our plate. (Never mind if he then dictates the task to the nanny.)"

35,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17693553-melissa-stacy,Rating 4 out of 5,"2/9/23 update: I'm bumping my rating up from 3 to 4 stars because I keep finding that more and more people can benefit from the knowledge that everyone needs time for self-care, friendships, and unicorn space. Very thankful that this book exists. **********First published in October 2019, the nonfiction/self-help book, ""Fair Play: A Game-Changing Solution for When You Have Too Much to Do (And More Life to Live),"" by Eve Rodsky, is a book that promises hard-working moms with live-in partners a solution to dividing up the household labor in a more equitable way.While there is definitely some useful advice in ""Fair Play,"" this book is a slog to get through, and I thought that the best advice in the text was buried at the very end. Overall, I found this book pretty irritating, boring, and DNF-worthy. Rodsky's strict solution to the problem of gender disparity in the home: to follow a very time-consuming card game that requires a constantly updated command board in order to ""re-deal"" household tasks with your partner, is really not something I would ever implement in my own home. But as Rodsky herself makes clear in the text, I already live in a home with a drastically fair and equitable division of household labor, so I'm definitely not the target audience for this card game.Rodsky presents the ongoing issues of patriarchy that women face in their homes as a failure of ""the women's movement"" to even name this problem, much less solve it, and... yeah, that irritated the sh*t out of me, to be honest. Either Rodsky has learned about feminism from The Howard Stern Show or she simply doesn't want to alienate the female patriarch book buyers who are all #OverMeToo, but this level of ignorance was a bit much. Rodsky also makes sure to never call out capitalism and/or capitalist values as having anything to do with the problems women face in any unfair division of household labor, so if you're at all worried that this book might take issue with capitalism: fear not. Capitalist values are never even named in this book, much less questioned, and most of the ""solutions"" Rodsky touts in the book are predicated upon being firmly within the reach of the upper-middle class; high-income homes headed by two working adults are ideal in this text. This was a market research read for me, and while I did find value in this book, it was not in the card game that Rodsky presented. But if I did fit the book's target demographic: an upper-middle class woman with two or more young children and married to ""an adult toddler husband"" who never did sh*t to help out at home, then I could definitely see how Rodsky's card game would be a life-saver for me. I think that Rodsky's focus on ""unicorn space"" is an excellent contribution to personal empowerment, and it's a message that people of all genders can benefit from, but this is the information that is buried at the very end of the book. I'm really glad that this book exists, and that so many women have benefited from Rodsky's card game. Her suggestions to have couples discuss their values around household tasks is a crucial communication step, and her acknowledgement that self-evaluation is the first step in seeking sustainable change is super important. But this book just really wasn't for me and I couldn't wait to get it out of my life and return it to the library. I have never been more grateful to have never known the utter hell of being married to ""an adult toddler husband."" It's one thing to see men portrayed as useless buffoons on TV. Quite another to face the hellscape of being married to one. I'd recommend this book to any woman who feels like an inhuman servant and longs to stop feeling dead inside. Three stars."
36,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13129149-meredith-mccaskey,Rating 5 out of 5,"In some ways I feel like I shouldn't write a review until my husband is done reading this book and we actually try implementing the Fair Play strategy in our household. But I'm going to go ahead and give it 5 stars anyway because I felt so affirmed in reading it. In the first few chapters there were a bunch of places I underlined and at one point I even scribbled in the margin, ""Thank you thank you thank you Eve!!""Your average middle class American wife/mom (and I believe that is the specific audience that Eve is writing to) is stretched thin by carrying almost all the burden of the emotional labor in the household. They become, as Eve calls it, ""the she-fault parent,"" the CEO of the household, the only person who knows what the schedule is, what kind of toothpaste to buy, how much toilet paper is left, what school projects are due, where the lunchboxes are (and what to put inside them), when the car registration needs to be renewed, what the week's menu is... you get the picture. And for a lot of women they are doing this on top of working part or full time. It's not that their husbands don't help‚Äì in fact that's the problem. Our society conditions men to view themselves as helpers in the running of a household, when, as Eve believes and I wholeheartedly agree, what most women want is partners.  Though some men... were taking {tasks}, they weren't holding on to them. Not without reminders. And an ""attaboy"" for a job completed. Ahem. A reminder, in itself, takes tremendous mental effort by you. It requires knowing what needs to be done, remembering what needs to be done, and reminding someone to get it done, whereas the person being reminded gets of easy. He doesn't have to remember a thing, nor does he worry about forgetting. And if you think about it, reminding and praising is the daily work of parenting children, not partnering with husbands. This book is Eve's solution to that problem, a system she designed to help lay all the household cards on the table and come up with a fair solution so that couples can be true partners with each other, resentment can be banished, and both partners can reclaim space for self-care, adult friendships, and what Eve calls ""unicorn space"" which is time to pursue the passions and interests that make each person her/his fullest, truest self. Eve guides you through the process of (literally) laying all the cards out on the table with your partner, breaking down  exactly  what it takes to run your household, deciding as a couple what your values are, and collaboratively forming a system that is fair, where all expectations are on the table and both partners are set up for success. Sound too good to be true? Maybe. What I realized while I was reading, however, is that though it sounds magical, what Eve is really doing more than anything else is teaching couples a way of communicating. My husband and I have had several discussions based on what he's read so far, and we've both admitted that a big part of the marital conflict we've had over the running of our household lies in the fact that in 8.5 years of marriage, we've never actually sat down and figured out a shared vision for what we actually want our family to look like, what our separate and collective values and goals are for our family, and how we can achieve those goals within those stated values. It feels a little embarrassing to write that, but I'm pretty sure we aren't the only married couple who drifted into a default pattern without realizing it. So... I have high hopes. I will definitely come back and update this review, but even just the reading of it was an affirming, and hopeful experience. I felt seen, heard, and understood, and that process allowed me to let go of some of my resentment and feel excited about actually collaborating with my husband to create a household where everybody's needs are met."

Just having a house and animals, I was amazed at how the tasks piled up for us both when they were broken down in detail. Overall, best takeaways for me were: 1. Each household partners' time is valuable and should be treated as such. 2. You household tasks and responsibilities will be fairly (not equally) distributed at any given time.

I actually bought the premade card set too, so we will test out the system, and I may change the review. However, it is clearly very specifically oriented to married couples with children, in rather traditional set ups. (The author even encourages couples to start using the book ‚Äúbefore they have children‚Äù- as if every couple will have kids!!) Because I work overseas and my husband and I speak different languages (which are more or less useful for completing tasks depending on the context), the book‚Äôs methodology doesn‚Äôt seem easily applicable to our task distribution. This is a shame, as the concept of CPE-ing tasks (fully conducting their Conception, Planning, and Execution) is indeed an issue we struggle with, and one I do believe is heavily gendered and worthy of exploring in the context of different relationship configurations (including non-heterosexual ones).But this book, rather than exploring how to customize the system to other relationship dynamics (same sex couples, issues when one partner has a disability or limited mobility, one partner travels extensively for work, no kids, kids of divorced parents splitting time between two households (so common!), maybe live-in elderly parents, low-income meaning less disposable income or less available time, etc etc etc), the author goes through far too many details about each ‚Äúcard‚Äù and ‚Äústep‚Äù. Like an extended instruction manual that could be summed up in around 20-30 pages. It just doesn‚Äôt seem realistic not to split some tasks, or divide who is responsible for the planning and execution components, for example, depending on mobility, language, time etc. Not to mention it seems like a DRAG to ‚Äúre-deal‚Äù some cards even on an hourly basis and to keep up with it all!! My god. It all seems like a good idea on paper, and could work for traditional (ish) middle/upper class straight white families without disabilities living in communities with extra help and regular schedules‚Ä¶ but outside this maybe not so customizable, practical, useful or, well, fun.It also plays into the same gendered tropes it is trying to break. I am a cis woman married to a cis man, and while the gender roles she rails against do influence our relationship (women carrying disproportionate mental/emotional load etc), it‚Äôs not as black and white as she portrays it. I thought I could share this book with my husband but NO WAY. It is clearly written only for women, to then orchestrate a conversation with their male partners, to whom it‚Äôs not particularly generous. And hey, I am all about radically transforming patriarchal norms in the domestic sphere (!!!) but this book doesn‚Äôt do that at all. The idea that tasks should be distributed on a weekly, daily, or hourly basis IN PERPETUITY feels like a bizarre and painful bandaid for the real underlying problem."

For those with partners that have done the work and both parties have 100% buy-in, where most of the basic needs are met (the ability to pay their bills, have adequate healthcare, a family network) -- I think that's rather a small set of partnerships out there, sadly. It may be a turn off for woman who feel lonely and do not have other women in their set to reach out to, do not have a high valued career to return to, or husbands who don't *want* to see the unseeable work they do. For that reason, the title is misleading because the title makes it seem like anyone with too much to do can play this game. This is a hopeful book, however, for who it may fit. "

A few thoughts: Some of the women in this book have true jerks for husbands. My husband is a Where‚Äôs the Butter? guy, but if we talk about him taking on a task at our weekly family council (yes, that‚Äôs a thing), then he does. Period. He can CPE it and I don‚Äôt need to worry. I didn‚Äôt need to know what each task entails. I know! I do most of them! Rodsky thinks that couples should get closer to 50/50 on household tasks... I think, however, that in my household our division makes sense given the relative time required for each of our jobs and our stress levels. Given that I had time to read 375 books last year, IG the hell out of most of them, work on becoming a climate activist, and exercise 5x a week I would say that I am finding plenty of unicorn space. Am I more efficient at household tasks? You bet. It‚Äôs the division of labor that works for us and when he‚Äôs home we share plenty of parenting tasks, etc. "

I found myself feeling bad for the author‚Äôs husband as she keeps tabs on everything and makes herself out to be the most superior person. She OFTEN refers to the gender gap, ‚Äúunhelpful husbands‚Äù and my favorite ‚Äúthe price of motherhood‚Äù....her going on and on and on about the unfair division of housework is exhausting. While her husband had a job, she only gives him credit for managing finances and car stuff.

I first heard about this book through a podcast episode of the imperfects that Mala said she wanted me to listen to. (I do recommend giving the episode a listen, it‚Äôs called Hugh & Penny the elephant in the relationship)This book can be broadly broken down into 3 parts The first part essentially lays out the bleak facts of divisions of labour in ""traditional"" heteronormative relationships especially after having children. I kept turning to Mala shocked at some fact or figure and she would simply say yeah checks out. Despite the fact that this book is written under the assumption that a woman is reading this section really should be read by men. In the second part Rodsky then provides a solution in the form of the ‚Äòfair play‚Äô card system where all the actions that may be required run a home are divided into 100 cards which can then be delegated to each person for total ownership, cards vary in size and work required from the broad ‚Äòcleaning‚Äô category to a small ‚Äòmail‚Äô action. The key part is conception, planning, and execution are all in the card owner‚Äôs control. I know I myself am guilty of being fairly competent at the execute or shift work part of a task but have unintentionally handed off the mental checklist and preparing duties to Mala. The third part of the book relates to finding your ""unicorn space"", something that gives you passion outside of work/spouse/children. In this section Rodsky provides guidance for searching for a passion that may have disappeared in the years since an unfair burden of domestic tasks were saddled on you. I think this part is an important part for anybody to read as it almost fits into a separate self-help category of how to give your life meaning. Overall, this book gets a solid 4/5 from me for not only highlighting the disparity in gender roles in a digestible, well researched, and supported way; but for coming up with a way to show it visually in a gamified way that can get your partner on board. It was quite disheartening to read a chapter dedicated to methods for broaching this topic with your partner down to some predone scripts based on the type of person that partner is. My only real gripe with this book is it feels written and the system developed from a position of wealth, with a lot of anecdotal evidence of success coming from couples who are in a well-off financial positions (the fact that dry cleaning is its own card separate to laundry)I can‚Äôt review the actual system yet; implementation is pending now that I‚Äôve learnt how to play."
51,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27181376-liisa-aavik,Rating 5 out of 5,"A must-read for those living together with a partner! Implementing the insights from this book can be a life-changing experience, profoundly impacting your relationship. Here's how my partner and I applied the book's principles:1. Initially, we engaged in a two-hour Fair Play game, utilizing the free cards available at https://www.fairplaylife.com/the-cards and a DIY Miro board. This exercise offered us a comprehensive overview of the tasks at hand and identified who was currently responsible for each. Since we don't have children, we promptly discarded 40 cards from the 100-card pack. We also deliberated on which tasks held significance for us and which did not ‚Äì for instance, we decided to forgo writing thank-you notes (""no, thank you""). We then redistributed the cards, ensuring a fairer distribution of responsibilities. We assigned specific tasks to each of us and established a minimum standard for certain chores. For instance, we agreed that waking up in a tidy home, free from clutter, is the minimum standard in the morning: things should be put into their homes before going to bed.2. Throughout the week, we abstained from giving random assignments to each other and refrained from criticizing one another. This time was dedicated to taking full ownership of our respective tasks.3. We instituted weekly 30-minute meetings every Friday. During these sessions, we reviewed how the week had gone, celebrating our successes first. If there were any feedback or suggestions to share, this was the designated time. We might revisit our minimum standards, making sure they remained relevant and reasonable. For instance, we might propose, ""Should we establish wiping the counters clean as a minimum standard after cooking, since it's noticeable when dirt accumulates during food preparation?""In essence, this book furnishes a systematic approach to managing your household and daily life akin to a business, fostering the dynamic of a power couple. I've truly relished the enhanced communication with my partner, the equitable division of chores, and the pleasure of waking up in a pristine home. It's liberating not to feel guilty that only he is thinking of fun activities for us to do.WHY READING THIS BOOK IS BENEFICIAL:The book elucidates the author's journey in creating the Fair Play game, detailing what didn't work and why, and how it evolved into its current form. It offers valuable insights into the statistical basis and personal interviews that underpin the system's design. The book's stories are instrumental in empathizing with the typical challenges faced by couples, especially those with children. Reading it before marriage and parenthood has been immensely rewarding for me. The case examples illustrate potential pitfalls and how to navigate them successfully. Much of the critical feedback directed at the cards could have been averted with attentive reading of this book; for instance, the misconception that one person should be stuck with dish duty for life. If you aspire to enhance your communication with your partner and excel at the Fair Play game, this book is a must-read!"

The base of the issues that are described really seemed to be lack of communication. If you are doing what you feel is more than your fair share of the house work, I just don't understand why you wouldn't discuss it with your spouse rather than complaining to your friends or relying on a card game to solve the problem. Not a fan as it did not seem to want to lay any ground work for personal accountability in solving problems."

""Domestic and unpaid labor, which seems to many, at first glance, like a minor issue because unpaid labor is so extravagantly unvalued by our society, actually adds up to hours, days, months, and even years of time inequality over the course of a lifetime."" (https://theeverymom.com/fair-play-cards/)Especially after kids, women disproportionately shoulder the load of domestic labor, particularly the invisible ""mental load"" of conception & planning of work (e.g. conception: thinking ahead to summer camp months in advance, planning: researching different options and considering family schedules, execution: registering for a camp)My key takeaways from the proposed system:Cards: Define areas of household ownership as ""cards"". A card is more than just an executable task (e.g. ""take out the garbage""), it's a general and ongoing area of ownership. Conception, Planning, and Execution (CPE): Owning a ""card"" involves being responsible for the conception, planning, and execution of any related work, and often execution is not the majority of the work.Conception: assessing your family‚Äôs needs and defining what you‚Äôll do to meet those needs.Planning: creating an action plan that outlines what will be required to do this task from start to finish.Execution: doing the work. Single owner: Cards should be owned in their entirety by a single person for a set period of timeShared total list: The couple should first agree on the entire set of cards jointly valued by their household, then agree on who owns which task (for what time period)Fair: Fair isn't necessarily a 50/50- split of cards*Biggest caveat is that this book is clearly written with a very specific audience in mind: married moms. It was also very heteronormative. However, I think I‚Äôm okay with that, as the book is designed to address a very specific problem: unfair division in household labor resulting from cultural and societal gender stereotypes and expectations.

59,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/516215-cari,Rating 4 out of 5,"I‚Äôve been going back and forth on whether this book is a 3 or 4 (so really it‚Äôs probably more of a 3.5!). On one hand, I can‚Äôt stop talking about this book with friends or referring to some of the real life relationship examples Eve writes about. But then I factor in that there are whole sections of the book probably worth skipping (like detailed descriptions of what‚Äôs included in various household activities) and how I question whether this methodology would actually work.. and that‚Äôs when my opinion of the book drops. I am almost exactly the target audience for this book - super busy mom in a two income household. However, I‚Äôm generally already okay with the amount of work my husband is contributing to the household and I‚Äôm not overwhelmed. So at first, reading this book made me think ‚Äúyay I‚Äôm lucky to have a helpful husband.‚Äù But then as I read on, it got me to start noticing all these things that started to annoy me (that maybe I was too busy to notice before)...like feeling compelled to ask my husband to jump in on certain tasks I would‚Äôve normally done without complaints... or realizing I don‚Äôt have a true passion of my own (aka Unicorn space). Yikes - was this book actually taking a somewhat content person and making me depressed??That being said the idea behind divvying out responsibility cards and allowing that person to own it sounds like an interesting challenge. Still very skeptical this would actually work and not cause more problems in the household. But we‚Äôll see when I actually get around to trying it out (maybe!)"

If not, there will just be a divorce. Since my spouse and I are already in therapy together and are primed for learning new ways to communicate, I think this could be a good way to sit down and talk about who takes the trash out and why, as it‚Äôs a rather small task that often blows out of control into big feelings, before tackling larger issues in the relationship.

63,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20862438-shawna-ridgley,Rating 2 out of 5,"The narrator is fantastic. It is the author and she is obviously passionate about the subject and it felt very much like she was sitting in my car/hanging out with me telling me all about this idea.In my opinion, this book is written for a very specific audience. I would have liked to have read this book with my husband, but am grateful I did not as the first few chapters of the book felt very negative towards men. As the book progresses, it does get better but it is very clear that the author is writing to women and not to men. So please be advised here.There are so many things I liked about the book and so many things I disliked about the book that I find myself really struggling to decide whether I liked it or not or would I recommend friends to read it?What I liked: She articulated something I had not been able to adequately express when I was in the middle of raising kids--that every single ""task"" that it takes to make life work has to be first identified (concept), then a plan needs to be put in place for how it will be taken care of (plan), and then the plan needs to be executed fully (execute). C.P.E In the chaos of life, a lot of time the wife is in charge of the concept & plan for EVERYTHING and while many husbands will gladly help execute the plan, the mental energy and responsibility for every task typically starts with the wife. I also like the idea of the game and to bring to light the ""invisible work"" that goes on in the home. I love the idea of a couple coming together to discuss every aspect of their lives and to ""assign"" ownership of the different areas instead of just expecting someone to take care of it (and by default that is typically the wife). I think this is very healthy.One other topic she addresses is the minimum standard of care (MSC). This is a must and I see where a whole lot of arguments could be avoided if you have discussed this previously. For instance say the card or task is ""Garbage"". The two of you would discuss what is the MSC for this card in our home? There have been many moments in my own marriage where it became very obvious that we have a different MSC. Does the garbage need taken out when it is almost to the top? Overflowing? Who takes out the bathroom garbage? What if the garbage is filled up and the person whose ""job"" it is, is not at home? Does ""garbage"" also mean putting a bag back into the trash can? Having a conversation ahead of time where you both will come to an agreement of what it means for the ""garbage"" to be taken care of helps you both be heard and expectations to be verbalized instead of assumed.What I didn't like: She mentions several times that this is not about scorekeeping--but the whole first half of the book felt that way to me. My personal overall philosophy of marriage is that it should be an ongoing collaboration and that there are times where one person will have to do more heavy lifting than the other because life happens. However, I felt that once you play the game there are some strong lines of not asking your partner for help if you are the one holding the card. I personally think you should always be collaborating and helping one another. If there is constant give and take then you learn to lean on one another and trust one another. I didn't enjoy the negativity towards men in general and I also felt there needed to be more discussion on how women tend to criticize their spouse's involvement. There also needs to be an acknowledgement that everyone needs space to ""grow"" in various areas. If one person has always been the one to cook meals but you want that to be more give and take--you will have to eat some unpleasant meals and be appreciative of the effort as the other partner gains skill in that area.I felt overall there was a negativity or maybe just a dismissal that a woman might be completely fulfilled in being a stay at home mom. There is a section discussing ""being interesting"" and she was sharing a story about a woman who quit her job to stay at home and then went to a party and realized no one was talking with her because she wasn't ""interesting"". I didn't see that as a problem of the person, but more of the group that she was with. Overall:Was the book interesting? YesDid I learn or discover something new or a new way to think about something? YesDid I get annoyed with the author? YesDid I disagree with many philosophies? YesI wish the book had been written by a married couple and focused on the excellent ideas of CPE & MSC with a balance of the positives and negatives both partners bring to the table. I think the CPE & MSC ideas are spot on and should be incorporated into every household. I think a couple should sit down and discuss how they can do life better and better support one another and then tailor-make the game for their family.

70,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4039516-heather,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book is one of the few that I've actually begun to implement in my own life. The author argues that one of the main reasons household tasks are not split more fairly between couples (i.e., why the woman continues to be the default or 'shefault' parent/housecleaner/cook/planner/chauffeur/etc.) is because jobs are distributed horizontally, rather than vertically. If one parent asks another to do one thing (e.g., make dinner tonight), it's annoying and difficult for both parents (why do I always have to ask? / do we have any tomatoes?). She calls these one-off requests RATS (random assigned tasks). Rather, just like in a successful business (Rodsky's background) each parent should be fully responsible for their set of tasks from start to finish: Conceptualize, Plan, and Execute. She recommends that parents sit down to go through all the household/parenting jobs and divide them up. Then, expect each parent to CPE their own cards. My partner and I now have a trello board for our jobs, one on each card, that we can arrange into his and hers columns. It also allows us to write details so that swapping cards is easier (e.g., on the 'bills' card, we list all the bills, etc.). So far, so good. There's a birthday party for one of our kids' friends this weekend, and while we've chatted about it, it was really nice to be able to say, ""This is your card, so ultimately, I'll leave it up to you."" My partner is getting the gift, has arranged childcare for the other kids so he can go too, and will take our son. Already, I feel lighter knowing that I'm not the one in charge of trying to remember and make sure someone follows through on the details for everything. We'll see how long it's helpful for us."

Had I known this from the start I would have read All The Rage instead. Here are the takeaways:-maintaining separate interests that you are passionate about is good for both partners.-every household task you do involves conception, planning, and execution. The mental load is big and should be shared. Honestly, this book could be a revelation if it was written for cisgender heterosexual men. But alas, by targeting middle to upper income heterosexual women who have typical 9-5 jobs with typical stressors‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs lacking.This basically ended up one more thing on the ‚Äúshit I do list.‚Äù If this was a card, it would fall under the category of ‚Äúresearch I do for the betterment of our family that I then have to explain to my husband who spent his equivalent free time enjoying memes and texting jokes to his buddies, but listened to my three minute summary of the book and now feels really enlightened and informed and progressive.‚Äù Unless the prospect of playing a literal card game to divide up chores in your marriage (only to be re-dealt weekly and sometimes daily) appeals to you, spend your time in other ways.

A lot of scholarly and literary work has already discussed the gendered division of domestic labor, but Eve Rodsky goes beyond identifying the obvious inequities and delineates an ingenious system (Fair Play) where everybody truly wins. Fair Play's massive bibliography is also a testament to how well researched the book is and demonstrates how much Rodsky seems to care about factuality and accuracy. She managed the delicate balance between objectivity and subjectivity adroitly.Not only is this book incredibly useful and informative, but it's also well-written. Peppered with entertaining anecdotes, Rodsky takes you on the deeply personal journey that led her to develop and write about Fair Play. Although her tone is sometimes comical and acerbic, it is ardent, inspirational, and, ultimately, optimistic. It's apparent that Rodsky genuinely cares about engendering lasting change and improving the quality of people's lives and relationships.Overall, I highly recommend this book. It made me laugh out loud, cry; and, most importantly, it made me reconceptualize the way I think about domestic labor and inspired me to rediscover my own Unicorn Space.-Ian Nel, PhD student in Clinical Psychology "

It felt very much like a us vs them thing where the women are constantly complaining about their husbands and this is system supposed to fix it. Which i can totally get why people want to do make household work more even and this can be great for starting a conversation but it also felt super negative. And then they want you to convince men to play this card game. Which felt like it was going to be more work than it‚Äôs worth. The construct of the game seemed like would be a cool tool until she actually read the cards. They were wayyyyyy too simplified to actually be helpful. Like cleaning is ONE card. That just could never work for me. That‚Äôs what lost me and I just couldn‚Äôt finish this.

I won this book as a part of Goodreads Giveaway and will be recommending this read to everyone in a partnership so they too can maybe benefit from the painstaking research that author Eve did and then honed into a 'game' of sorts. This game is incredibly detailed and organized and even though I am not currently in a relationship I can still use this information to help organize my life! Although I can't play the game yet, I can still benefit from the information it provides, which is amazing in it of itself. Bravo, Eve. This is an amazing book that should be a manual provided for any couple upon marriage or coupling. Give this book a read! It will benefit you whether you are in a relationship or not."

Of course, you have to have a man that isn't stuck in the 1950s. Like my husband was in the 1970s, lol. I thought of my daughter the entire time I was reading this book She has an incredibly demanding job and then comes home and does most of the household stuff. The author explains that it isn't how much money your time is worth but that time is equal to time. So often Women are delegated to all the household and childrearing work because they don't make the money or as much of it. It is hard to believe in this day and age that there is still ""women's work"". This book will really open your eyes to how much women do that's unpaid and not acknowledged."

The ‚Äúwhich type of husband‚Äù is yours quiz had terrible choices!

I also find it extremely off putting that she is constantly defensive of her husband‚Äôs great character and refers to how they are still ‚Äúhappily‚Äù married despite their challenges. There are snippets of real stuff - socialized gender roles and references to articles that are relevant but not revolutionary. The deck idea seems interesting but it could use a few tweaks as well.

Not a huge fan....

92,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5020685-megan,Rating 2 out of 5,"I give this two stars because I imagine some of Rodsky's tips will be helpful to some folks. Unfortunately, I hated just about everything about this book and only got through it by hate-reading and reminding myself it's a galley that I'm (long) overdue on reviewing. Buckle up: this is more rant than book review.* Despite the marketing, this book is written for heterosexual couples with children. Nearly half of the 100 household tasks are kid-related. While Rodsky assures readers that the system works even without kids, nearly all her examples are kid-related and all her guidance (from identifying your personality type to determining the ideal number of shared cards) assumes you're playing with the 100-card deck. Also, aside from a few token hypothetical LGBT examples, all of Rodsky's language and examples assume the players are adults in a two-person heterosexual marriage. No attempt to acknowledge the myriad ""nontraditional"" household configurations ‚Äî roommates, adult children or extended family members in the household, partnerships outside wedlock, poly relationships‚Ä¶ the list goes on.* You're not allowed to deviate from Rodsky's system because your marriage will end in divorce. Literally. Specifically, you're not allowed to take equal responsibility for tasks or ask your spouse to help execute a task you've planned. All hell will evidently break loose if both of you are buying groceries, and there's nothing a man hates more than being asked to drop off the dry cleaning if that's your responsibility. According to the 100+ men Radsky interviewed, this ""Random Assignment of Tasks is one of the top reasons men resent their wives, admit to affairs, and express a desire to divorce."" (To which I say: I really think there are bigger issues here.) And yet somehow my husband and I have managed to remain married for over a decade despite our *both* doing the dishes, cooking meals, and feeding the cats, and my asking him rather than a neighbor to clean the kitty litter when I'm away at a conference ü§î Rodsky's system also expects one spouse to take full responsibility even for tasks where a partnership seems more appropriate ‚Äî such as deciding on birth control and staying in touch with extended family.* I'm not a huge fan of men myself these days, but even I was insulted by how deeply misandrist this was. Over and over, the anecdotes Rodsky provides and language she uses indicate she thinks all men are irresponsible, lazy, and selfish. She classifies men into 5 groups and calls the best group ""More than Most"" ‚Äî as in ""most men suck but this group is marginally better."" She shares that the husband of one of her interviewees signed up for SEAL training, shot himself in the groin, and got himself hospitalized for 6 weeks, and that her interviewee assumes this was done intentionally to get out of helping with their newborn and as a form of birth control. Which is just‚Ä¶ a deranged take on that situation. One of Rodsky's rules is to develop a ""minimum standard of care"" (or ""MSC"") about how a task will be done, which is perfectly reasonable. Except all the examples she gives about MSC disagreements are about how men are slobs. In my personal observations, though, it's women holding unreasonably high standards and criticizing men for any efforts they *do* make that's more likely to be a problem. Example: my MIL and SIL complain that my FIL doesn't do enough around the house, but whenever he makes a meal, they criticize both his cooking methods and how the food tastes.* I'm not going to argue that there are plenty of men out there who don't participate as much as they should in household tasks. But Rodsky's approach takes an inexplicable middle ground. On the one hand, she describes men who literally say things like, ""My job is more important than yours, so I don't have to do anything around the house or take calls from the kids' school at work."" To which I say: if that's what he thinks, you've got bigger issues than him not doing the dishes and this book won't help you get a divorce. On the other hand, Rodsky describes wives dumping wet loads of laundry on their husbands' pillows because they forgot to move it to the dryer, and refusing sex until the trash is taken out, as if this behavior is perfectly rational and justified. Readers are forbidden from checking in with their spouses if they notice a task has been forgotten because they'll be too furious to think straight. It honestly doesn't seem to have occurred to Rodsky that you could just‚Ä¶ have a conversation with your partner. Like grown-ups. But why do that when you could instead be childish and passive aggressive?And really, that's what annoyed me most about this book. It assumes that its readers (frustrated wives) have the emotional development of children and that their partners (heterosexual husbands, remember) are the same. We can't be trusted to have calm conversations before reaching a boiling point. The only possible way to ""dial down the crazy"" is to buy this book and follow Rodsky's rules to the letter."
93,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33366799-susanna,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5 stars rounded up. Eve Rodsky sets out a great system for dividing up domestic chores between partners, but she unfortunately pairs it with story after story of men's historic and ongoing lack of domestic responsibility. I think the ""Fair Play"" system could be a lifesaver (haven't tried it out yet), but reading the book could also just lead to increased resentment and bitterness.¬†I liked the basic outline of the system in chapter 6. First, choose which of the 100 household tasks she's listed are not important for your family based on your values. Second, collaborate with your partner on explicit ""minimum standards of care"" based on both partners' preferences‚Äìthe more detailed your standards, the better. Third, decide which person will be responsible to carry out the task. Fourth, reassess the division of labor at a specified time.Rodsky emphasizes that the same person must do all aspects of each task: ""whoever holds a task card Conceives, Plans, and Executes the heck out of it‚Äîwithout reminders, half-ass efforts and excuses, or soliciting a 'good job' for completion."" After testing her system, she said, ""The couples who adhere to the Fair Play CPE approach experience the most dramatic shifts away from dysfunction, resentment, and passive-aggressive behaviors in their relationship and toward more time-saving efficiency and feelings of fairness in the home.""I really like the invitation to consider your family values and let that impact your tasks and to ask what outcome you want from using the system (less nagging, more clarity on who does what, etc.).One last thing I liked: Rodsky talks a lot about ""unicorn space"" (why oh why did she choose that term?!). Unicorn space is time to develop your non-work, non-child-related special interests/passions to share with the world. There is an inspiring section in chapter 11 on exploring what your passion project might be. Rodsky believes this unicorn space is essential to maintaining self after parenthood.Something that surprised me: ""There is no consistent data proving that women are better at multitasking than men."" According to Dr Pat Levitt, ""Even when folks designed studies to prove that women are better at multitasking, nothing was really there. My guess is that women are doing more of the household organization and domestic work not because her biological variation makes her better at it, but because of culture influence."" (However there was no footnote to check out the studies.)A criticism, more of a pet peeve: Fair Play is presented as a game you play where you deal and redeal a deck of cards which seems silly to me.I also dislike the subtitle, which is an utterly unhelpful description that better describes the book Happier Hour. This book is not for just anyone looking to gain time, it's entirely about couples and managing the domestic workload.I listened to the audiobook and then skimmed the ebook."
94,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57575374-stephanie-loux,Rating 4 out of 5,"I don‚Äôt read too many self-help type books anymore but I think this one is worth the read and discussion following. I think this would be a crucial book to read as newlyweds or before you start a family. It would also be super helpful if your current lifestyle isn‚Äôt serving you and your partner and family overall but it may be tricky if both partners aren‚Äôt on board with a new system. It would be a great tool for couple‚Äôs therapy though if you‚Äôre struggling and looking for a new way to organize your life at home. In essence, it‚Äôs a time audit to make sure both partners have fair (not necessarily equal) cards they‚Äôre responsible for in the household to ensure each partner has their fair share of time to pursue their own happiness through self-care, friendships, and ‚Äúunicorn space‚Äù. Unicorn space is what makes you come alive? What makes you uniquely you? It can and probably will change but is something I‚Äôve always wanted to or would like to get back to. For example: crafting, gardening, volunteering, sports like an intramural team or training for a marathon, playing guitar, writing, small groups like book clubs, etc. It‚Äôs embracing your right to be proud and interesting to yourself, your partner, and the world. And you need to support your partner equally with time. It‚Äôs about time fairness and a budget of time to ensure you‚Äôre living a life you don‚Äôt want to escape from by setting up your values and focusing on what matters to lead a fulfilling life. It‚Äôs also about valuing each other‚Äôs time.Overall it was a good concept and important to discuss with your partner and family but was a little strict and didn‚Äôt include families like ours where my husband travels the majority of the week so it‚Äôs not exactly possible to expect him to do a fair share when he‚Äôs not physically here to do it. (He does other things to help out though.)Thankfully, we‚Äôve figured out a pretty good system in our home but we‚Äôre also thankful that we started budgeting our finances early on in our marriage that we‚Äôve stuck to and this year we‚Äôve stuck to a fitness and calorie budget pretty strictly for the past 3 months so it‚Äôs just another tool to let you be in charge of your life and not trying to fly by the seat of your pants and catch up constantly. This book does have a website and actual game that is meant to be played during weekly check-ins with your partner which I think is an important way to touch base and stay ont he same page so we might look into that. As a SAHM for the past 12 years adding part time work as well as a traveling husband, it‚Äôs also validating to see what all I actually am responsible for to keep our home running. It‚Äôs a lot of mental work as well as physically being here for my kids and running all the places."
95,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30940-benjamin,No Rating,"How? I think I heard her on some podcasts, so I got the book from the library, which led to me getting the card deck -- which still sits unused on my office desk.(Also, this review is really from Oct 2022, but I mentioned this book in another review and Jurvis pointed out that I was missing the review, so take everything here with ~8 months of grains of salt.)What? Here's the history of this book's creation: big business Rodsky has a breakdown over the unequal mental load of parenthood, realizes her big business background gives her insight into how to organize a house.The exec summary on this book: all time is created equal and people should have fair amounts of time (not equal, exactly, but fair) for self-actualization or just being a self. How to get there? First, think about the required tasks and discuss the minimum viable care for each task that you and your partner are willing to do; then split the tasks up using the card system that Rodsky created (and sells), and whoever owns that card owns it from conception to finish. (Which cuts down on the person at the store calling home to ask ""what sort of berries?"" or just buying strawberries when the blueberries are actually for a school project and need to be blue.)Yeah, so? In my memory of this book, Rodsky is an MBA because some of this feels like jargony business-talk, and even the things I like are somewhat couched in corporatization of the American household language.BUT also, there's things I like here that I think get sanded down if we just think about this as ""business person explains how to optimize your life."" For one thing, the ultimate goal here isn't, like, to crush parenting or hack your life. The ultimate goal is to construct a life where your values are livable and where you have a purpose beyond either capitalism or parenting. As someone whose days are literally ""I capitalism until I get off work and then parent and then when the boy is asleep, I do the parenting-orthogonal work of making lunch and getting the house taken care of,"" I really appreciate this angle.And even the actual logistical stuff here seems useful: like, if you go shopping for school lunch material but don't have the context for school lunches, then you may not make the best choices; and also, the daily tasks (like school lunches) are particularly burdensome compared to the one-off or occasional tasks (car maintenance), and so you should re-deal the task-cards sometimes.So, as with all self-helpy books, this one goes on a little long, and maybe you could get all you need from listening to a podcast, but if you're struggling with this stuff, then maybe find one of those podcasts to listen to while you clean dishes."
96,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/981427-anne,Rating 4 out of 5,"Research shows that even when both spouses work full time, the majority of American women still handle much more of the workload at home, essentially having a ""second shift"" on top of their job, not to mention a whole bunch of mental/emotional work that is invisible but takes much time and energy. After dealing with frustrations in her own marriage, and then surveying 500+ couples, Eve Rodsky has identified exactly what the tasks - visible and invisible - in a household are and has a strategy, based on project management, for how to get it done effectively and rebalance roles. I appreciated how it felt both cathartic (yeah, women ARE expected to do so much more around the house and are so likely to be come the ""she-fault"" parent - what gives??) and collaborative. Though acknowledging legit frustrations that wives/mothers can have about the unfair expectations/load as well as having to handle the majority of a household's emotional labor that often goes unseen, the author also really encourages a partnership process with spouses, a process that will make both individuals in a relationship happier, and their marriage stronger too. I also appreciated how hands-on it is - the author provides a list of 100 ""cards"", tasks that are held by one partner in a marriage, that can be printed out (or even purchased as actual cards), with specific instructions for how to balance the workload of a household/marriage - both the seen and unseen labor - fairly (note that ""equal"" and ""fair"" are different things!) based on skills, interests, logistics in your own partnership. The second half goes into super detail about how to ""play"", so it got a bit in-the-weeds or repetitive if you're just listening/reading, but it's a great resource to go back to if you actually do follow through. Also, it's clearly geared toward heterosexual couples, which she acknowledges, but just something to note. Personally it fit my own marriage circumstances and hit home as it will for a lot of married women with children; it can still be read/appreciated by men or by people in other types of relationships or without kids, but it wouldn't have the same oomph in terms of feeling seen."
97,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39926789-elise,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5 starsI really like the spirit of the Fair Play method. It exists to create an equitable distribution of labor at home. I especially enjoyed parts 1 and 2. For context: I feel like the labor in my household is fairly well distributed. But it's something I actively focus on. But there are certainly some tasks in our household where the Conception, Planning, and Execution are split between two people. My goal is to make sure the CPE is handled by ONE person instead of being split. This book has made me really think about this.I do feel like the Fair Play game has limitations. The 100 cards don't fit the way that tasks are distributed in my household. Some tasks are grouped together (such as ""cleaning"") that I prefer to break into more cards. I like the idea of Conception, Planning, and Execution, but I want to break cleaning tasks into smaller pieces. I wish there was a way to customize the game for your personal situation. I might get a little creative and make some additional cards to make the method work best for my household.I would recommend this book to anyone concerned about equitable distribution of labor in their household. Even if the method doesn't work perfectly for you, there is still a lot of valuable ideas in this book."

Identifying all of the mental and physical tasks required to run a family is just smart. Understanding the full mental load and steps made before executing any task can help make those tasks more appreciated/valuable. The concept that time is equal for both spouses ( no matter how much you are/are not paid for it) is obvious but often not supported.I would cautiously recommend this book to couples who are deeply committed to each other, full of humility, confident in themselves, and focused on the success of their spouse. The risk of discussing these potentially polarizing issues should be weighed against whether or not the spouses are either desperate for validation in any task or ready to take full responsibility for any task. If you are the type to ‚Äúkeep score‚Äù, you may want to pass.Also, heads up, lots of strong language."
99,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7131865-dipika,Rating 3 out of 5,"Stripped of its component parts, I can appreciate the underlying premise of this book which is that the responsibility of parenting and household management still she-faults to the woman and that that's a problem. I can even get behind the underlying philosophy of seeking equity over equality to keep resentment at bay down the road. But, the ""game"" this book suggests is overly simplistic and fails to account for various cultural and economic realities that can get in the way of achieving her intended outcome. e.g. don't ask your spouse to pick up glue for your kid's project on the way home from work if schoolwork is your ""card"", but what if you're a one car household far from conveniences? It's also incredibly heteronormative and inadvertently reinforces gender stereotypes that it's simultaneously trying to undo."

It dropped off at the end bc I didn't have the physical cards that the author was talking about, nor did I have a partner who was reading along with me. I think this book had a lot of good points on relationships and divisions in the house hold, I imagine a lot of women reading it don't believe their partner/spouse ever would. Even if the positives of trying this method was fully realized by said partner, what is their motivation? If ppl say to make their partner happy, I feel like they would've already made the effort?

The only big thing that I didn‚Äôt like is the strictness of some of the rules; there‚Äôs often real need to share tasks/execution and assigning half of a task to one partner on a routine basis can actually be best for everyone as long as there‚Äôs sufficient communication, context, and buy-in. There isn‚Äôt a ton of nuance for situations like this described within the book.

Good book for partners to read, not to shame someone (although the author does lean in pretty harshly on that) but to really get a good look at the distribution of household duties."

We already barely see the man because he works so much for us. it‚Äôs my personal opinion (though it may be an unpopular opinion) that our rolls as a wives and mothers are truly sacred. It‚Äôs an honor to be the one at home manning the house, raising the children and everything else that comes in-between. My husband has made countless risks, and continues to make sacrifices, along with the blood and sweat it has taken to get us where we are in life. We are a team. We serve each other. If one of us sees a need, we don‚Äôt belittle or nag that it‚Äôs not done; we just do it, (of course if we can find the time). That means that I often find him sweeping or doing dishes, and he‚Äôll come home to the lawn mowed. He couldn‚Äôt do what he does for us without me doing my part (and he tells me that), nor could I do my job without him doing his part. We have different rolls, but we work at them together, and not one is more important than the other."

I don't see this working for a single parent as it addresses equity of home responsibilities or for a couple struggling financially where having ""unicorn space"" is not possible for either partners. But I don't want to bash this book bc there were some positives I took from it.I don't have children, but I reflected on what this looked like growing up and having my parents split and my dad saying my mother didn't deserve any money/support because he made all the money in the house while she cared for my sister and I. (Best believe there was a fucking riot inside of me because I have the deepest respect for my mom and how hard she worked/works.)This gave me the verbage needed to express to my partner about wanting more help on the domesticated side of things. Also, affirmation to present how we both spend our time and how its valuation should not be quantified by monetary gains."

I didn't think there was anything earth-shattering in this book, but I really like having a very practical system laid out, even if quite a lot of it doesn't apply to childless couples (and the pet area seems to be much too downplayed for us). It makes me mad that I have to be the instigator of adopting this system. Still, the point that every item needs conception, planning, and execution and men do this just fine at work and it shouldn't be different at home was helpful."

I'm still curious if this works, as it seems to need both parties to want to do this in order to be successful, and uses the concept of a game to distribute chores.

124,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32212940-out-of-the-bex,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 For the right person, this book is a game-changer. HOWEVER...The likelihood of you being that ""right person"" really depends on your values, status, and current state of affairs. Keep that in mind as you read both the book description and the reviews surrounding mine (which seem to be quite polarized! I'll do my best to break down both sides for you below).I'm a firm believer that you can never make something to please everybody, and this work is a great example of that fact. This book is primarily designed for women with children who feel dissatisfied with the current divide of family life duties between themselves and their male partners. Sure, you can read this if you are in a different style of relationship (because there really is some stuff in here that will make you think and can totally be adapted for you--imo), but you may feel out-of-category by the many examples which are based on this books target audience, namely middle-aged married women with kids.That being said! Here's what I liked and didn't like about this book: LIKED: Who doesn't love good communication?! I love the premise of this work and I am all for exploring ways to have the hard conversations that ultimately lead to an easier, more fulfilling life with your partner. I believe that setting expectations as a couple is a big part of what leads to your happiness (or otherwise). Plus, as a very house-proud person and one who freakishly adores home maintenance topics, the basic idea of the Fair Play game which seeks to better articulate your individual needs for the invisible work that goes into making a house a home is quite appealing to me. Look, I didn't agree with everything in this book (see below). But you know what? I almost never do, especially in self-help books. Aside from the statements and perspectives that are very different from my values and life-outlook, there were plenty of stories and data examples that did make me think. It was a good way to excercise my mind and ask myself some question like: does this feel true to me? Or not? Is this something I have experienced or seen my friends experience? Does this sound like a solution that may actually make a difference for me? Or not?DIDN'T LIKE:This book so VERY often edges on the verge of the narrative that puts men and women starkly against each other. Ie: Men are apparently the worst??? (I really disagree).It can be very ""complain-y"" and self-indulgent. This isn't something I find very helpful to anyone as I'm more of the belief that change is actionable upon the individual and blaming other people won't get you very far. HOWEVER... this book does talk about individual action as well, but it was like we had to get past the complaining bit first??? I'm not sure if this was just to appeal to the target audience or to get that audience invested in the message by first speaking the ""language."" So. I'm conflicted on that point. But, yeah. There ya go. The Fair Play idea is such a great one! At least at it's most basic. Yet some aspects of the system I feel have been taken a bit too far in their stringency. For a book that has pigeon-holed it's audience so much, this aspect only seemed to make that worse and it makes some of the system seem unapproachable.The Fair Play system itself is being sold as a book and a book needs to be filled. I have to wonder about some of the contents which seem to be just to fill the book up and little more. Heads up, you need to print the cards online (should you choose to play). THE BOTTOM LINEI could not relate to a large portion of this book. I actually feel kind of sad that enough women feel this way that a book has been written on the topic. And I'm not sure what to do with that. If this book had been perhaps a bit more pure on what I thought it was from the description (namely, a fun way to divide household chores happily) then I likely would have enjoyed it more. I could have done without the self-indulgent, complaining segments. But I also weirdly get why they were there...Hopefully this review made some small ounce of sense! It's tricky, because I am seeing it from a few different sides (my marketing side, my wife side, my woman side, my scholarly side). And I hope based on your reaction to this review you will know if this book is for you, or not.I truly think there are some gems buried in here and I am grateful for the mental excercise as well as the basic idea of the Fair Play game. At the same time, I don't know if I could easily recommend this to folks since it's audience is so narrow and the examples used so divisive. "

But that‚Äôs where it stops.The book is incredibly ableist, heteronormative, and assumes patriarchal marriage structures.

There is only one card for having a ‚Äúspecial needs‚Äù child, even though most parents of disabled children can tell you that their care permeates every aspect of a family‚Äôs life. Same with caring for aging parents or other family members or friends. There are very few same-sex couple examples added in as afterthoughts. All of these problems could have been easily avoided and fixed with simple language shifts and a less ableist viewpoint. I‚Äôll take the unicorn space and leave the rest."
128,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3777747-erin,Rating 2 out of 5,"Recognizing that women tend to do a disproportionate amount of the household and childcare work, even in a relationship where both partners work full-time jobs, Rodsky created a system to help couples divide family responsibilities in a way that is more fair and manageable. While I can see why this book could be a game-changer for many couples, I personally don't feel like this system is that useful to me. Most likely because my husband is incredible (he definitely falls into Rodsky's ""even more than most"" category) and we've always been very intentional in how we share household responsibilities. I honestly didn't identify with many of the examples that Rodsky shared, but it does make me sad that so many women have these struggles. I also felt like I disagreed with one of the main rules of the Fair Play system. She talks about the three parts of any responsibility: conception, planning, & execution (CPE). It makes sense to recognize these parts, because a bulk of the work goes into the conception and the planning of a task, even if the execution is the only aspect that is visible. One of her main rules is that the CPE of a responsibility should NEVER be separated, because this leads to confusion, inefficiency, and contention. But my husband and I have been splitting tasks across the CPE lines for years without any problems (i.e. one person makes the grocery list, the other goes grocery shopping; or, one person makes the oil change appointment, while the other one takes the car to it). I would also argue that this makes us more efficient, rather than less. I feel like the real issue here is not the separation of the CPE, but the quality of your communication. If you have clear and consistent communication, I just don't see why it's an issue to divide out different parts of the same task. But that's just my personal experience!There were a few aspects of this book that were also very applicable to me. I loved her discussion of the toxic time messages. For me, the most important lesson is that ""All time is created equal. Time is measured in minutes not dollars."" One person's time is not more or less valuable than another's, regardless of whether it is paid or unpaid. This book also helped me reflect on how we will help our child(ren) internalize our family values. Rodsky discussed how in childhood, girls on average do 50% more household chores than boys. I think this is why it always bothered me when I was pregnant with my first child and people would say, ""Oh it's so good to have a girl first because they can be so helpful."" I wanted to respond, ""Well you could raise a boy to be helpful too.""I also thought a lot about Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's statement in ""Dear Ijeawele"" that dividing the household work will not always look like a 50/50 split (which Rodsky agrees with as well), but you will know when it is fair because neither of you will feel resentment. Truth! Anyways.... long review. I had a hard time deciding how to rate it, because I think the fact that this book provides such a practical step-by-step system to implement could be a life-changer for some people, but for me it was just a super quick, interesting read."

130,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6158525-britney-bookdrunksloth,Rating 4 out of 5,"First off, this review may change based on results. I've just finished reading the book, and I feel positively about it. My husband has said he will be a willing participant in trying this new system out. Once that happens, our actual experience using Fair Play can either negatively or positively affect my review and rating.That being said, just from reading this book I feel good. I feel like I might have a realistic plan in my hands that can improve my home life. The main thing I loved from the very beginning of reading this book is that I don't feel alone. After reading the different stories described and reading the author's guesses at what I am feeling or thinking, I would think, ""That's me!"" It helped me in just that aspect alone. What I have been feeling and experiencing in my life is something others experience and it is one version of normal. And it's ok to want for something better.This book does mainly focus on the perspective of Mother and Wife of a household with children. However, the game is customizable to fit your family's needs and values. Cards can be removed if they do not apply. In my personal opinion, cards can be added if you find something missing. You and your partner define the logistics of each card and work together to figure out what is best for your family. Eve Rodsky does talk about the benefits for everyone in the household to have an organized system in place like this one. She talks about the benefits for an over exhausted wife/mother, as well as the benefits for a well meaning, overly nagged husband/father. She even points out the benefits to children in the home who see a working positive relationship between their parents who still can identify as interesting people outside of their roles as parent or spouse.One funny thing from my life is I tried to create a similar system for my own home about a year ago. It was definitely no where near this detailed and thought out, but I thought of putting chores on index cards and my husband and I each held half. It didn't work out very well. But after reading this book and seeing all the research and testing Eve Rodsky did, it makes so much sense why it didn't work. We lacked a lot of the fundamentals found in the Fair Play system, like the rules, and the knowledge of fair instead of equal. This system jumped out at me because of the card game mentality, and I think it is right up my alley.Again, I haven't yet put this system into practice yet. I am planning on updating my review once my family has tried it out. But after reading the book, I am looking forward to the process and potentially seeing the benefits it talks about."
131,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/250717-rebecca,Rating 4 out of 5,"(*Up front advance warning that this book solely describes hetero-normative relationship roles, so thus my review uses them.) I found this book an interesting and helpful companion to the book Overwhelmed: Work, Love, and Play When No One Has the Time. Overwhelmed is maybe a little more fun to read, but this book actually posits an action plan for couples. Rodsky's initial goal was to stop being the ""she-fault"" parent for virtually all domestic chores, but as she researched and designed her system, she realized it would be better for men too. Because women tend to do all the ""conception and planning"" and then nag men to ""execute"" a task, men often don't have the context they need for a task and fail. Usually the woman then starts shaming and blaming the man, and things go downhill from there.So Rodsky's goal became to divide up each domestic task including the complete CPE for each--conception, planning and execution--and ""deal"" each task to a partner. I was impressed at her numeration and details for all aspects of domestic married life with children. In some ways it was a bit depressing to read a list of all the things mostly women do in such detail, especially the mental load of it. But I think it's helpful for us to share with our partners and really begin to split the work better. Personally, I'm grateful to have a partner who already CPEs several tasks; we have worked hard to get to this point in our marriage and it feels good. However, this book still revealed ways we can improve and this book encouraged me to do some self-examination about my Unicorn Space--""the skills and passions that keep you interested and interesting."" Interesting to note Unicorn Space is not self-care (pedicures, exercise, etc.) not is it date nights/social time with other couples.Overall I recommend for busy families, especially for women who are often carrying most of the domestic burden. This book offers the clearest actual solution I have come across to help approach your spouse, really lay out the work that needs to be done, and distribute it so you can ""play fair."" "

That without you, things just wouldn‚Äôt get done? That you make it all happen, even if your partner occasionally pitches in?Ironically, I felt the opposite. I was worried that I was letting my husband do the bulk of the work, and I felt guilty because women are usually the default in our culture.What I discovers was that we actually have a pretty equitable partnership... he just ends up doing most of the daily grind tasks because of our schedules (and because I‚Äôm terrible at money and basic life skills). And I was reminded how nice it is to have a partner that I 100% trust to get things done without having to remind or check in, as women often feel they need to.The biggest eye opener for me was that sometimes neither of us truly owns a task- so we end up working twice as hard because we are splitting it or worrying about who‚Äôs doing what. We are going to try to truly own our ‚Äúcards‚Äù so that we are both feeling more free and less stressed.

I don't think I even got halfway but each time I tried listening to it it was getting me so riled up and frustrated that I just decided it was time to part ways. My good friend and sister-in-law had told me about this book and from what she told me I was really interested in just getting more details about this ""fair play"" system. Basically, a system where you and your spouse realize that the one that's at home does most of the work at home dealing with cleaning, kids, etc. But it's not just executing them, it's also about how much goes on in all phases (i.e., conception, planning, deciding, executing). Plus there's more than meets the eye on tasks that keep a household running. Anyway, the point is that you both sit down and talk about how you can more evenly divide the tasks so that the load isn't so overwhelming for one partner. It's also a way to open the eyes of your spouse to help them see how much really goes on at home. I like all of that. But man, this book was heavy-handed with resentment and frustrations. And I just couldn't handle it. I am lucky enough to already have a husband who is aware of a lot of what I do each day. And he's OK when I don't get much done because of kids or burnout. He's also very helpful and pulls his weight when he is at home. So maybe this book just wasn't for me. I have a hard time hearing people talk badly about their spouses. Especially in a book that will be spread around and around. So not cool. Even if you preface it with a ""we have changed now and are better"". It felt like she really hadn't moved on from events that had happened in the past and it was just eating at me. Anyway, done with it. "

I started talking about it with them before I finished reading the book and we had some great discussions about the topic. I‚Äôm definitely sharing this book with my them to read.I LOVED the concept of Unicorn Space! Because I don‚Äôt have kids I realized I already have this (Bookstagram and future blog üòâ). The book made me appreciate it more since it talks about how many couples with kids don‚Äôt get to have this space where they work on their passions. This is a book that I can see myself revisiting when we have kids (when we have more cards to play with) but I definitely recommend it. "

I saw this book recommended when someone said their marital partnership was at-capacity: they were doing ALL they could, and it still felt like it wasn‚Äôt enough. Now, that‚Äôs not the premise of the book (women are actually doing everything) but the second half of the book that describes the system does apply.I consider myself in a fairly progressive relationship, which includes fully trusting my partner to parent our kids and run the house if I‚Äôm gone, but of course we have weaknesses. The main weakness of the book, I think, was that it came across as man-bashing. Maybe I‚Äôm just lucky to be surrounded by pretty amazing men, and most in the world are jerks? But the stats are real, and I know so many women who are carrying 99% of the mental load in their families, so I get it. If a guy picks this book up though‚Äîskim the beginning. You‚Äôll get the importance, but no need to be dragged through the mud.The second half of the book is much more balanced, showing weakness of both men and women in hetero relationships. Also, we are GOING to give this a try. My favorite concept is CPE: conception, planning and execution. Many times in our household, I do the C & P but we share the E, and I can see now that it is highly inefficient and draining on me. I may come back and update my review as we give this a shot! If this maximizes our efficiency and reduces both of our mental loads, I‚Äôm GAME."

This came out in the Fall of 2019 and I interviewed Eve on the Organize 365 Podcast in December 2019 (Episode 312 - https://organize365.com/fair-play-wit...). One of the things I struggled to articulate for years was the mental load I had as the female parent in our family with two kids. Women tend to do more physical in home care and tend to carry the mental load of caring for the home and family. In the book, she helps us identify the many parts of simple tasks like ‚Äúmaking dinner‚Äù - the meal planning, the grocery shopping, the food preferences of each family member, the food preparation, and even the clean up after eating. Not only does this book make you think about the division of labor in your home and family, it explains how we unpack our feelings and better distribute the load. It helps us to level the playing field in our families. If you are looking for a solution to the problem of mental load, Eve has it for you.Watch my full video review (available June 23, 2020) at https://youtu.be/MMzoyfY2vHg"
138,no user info,Rating 2 out of 5,"This was a really frustrating book to read. The pragmatic and practical side of me really appreciated the way the author broke down tasks which explained ways to be more efficient in running a home and communicating about them with your partner. I will say that it spoke more to the stay-at-home mom with kids and a working husband than anyone else. What I really struggled with in this book was the way in which the author wrote about her husband and men in general. It‚Äôs impossible to miss the frustration and perhaps contempt she feels for partners who don‚Äôt understand the work that goes into running a home & having kids. I felt caught between wanting to share the tidbits I was learning with my husband and not being able to let him read a page for fear of him picking up this. That didn‚Äôt matter, though, because we would often end up arguing over what I did share because he felt the perspectives in the book were very one-sided, which I agreed with. As someone without children, but 5 years into marriage I didn‚Äôt feel a connection with the frustration that maybe other stay-at-home moms (as I‚Äôm assuming those who had it picked for Reese‚Äôs Book Club did). What I did take away from this is that communication is so key to the sharing and running of a life together in terms of expectations of tasks & to understand the full breadth of what each partner contributes. "
139,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55185917-tori-pauling,Rating 5 out of 5,"I am clearly the target audience for this book, so that should be a disclaimer first and foremost. I have a husband who willingly and happily participates in household and child rearing activities. He‚Äôll do anything I ask, but I was getting tired of asking. We started having conversations about the ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù or ‚Äúemotional‚Äù labor that I and many other women do and wanted a way to divide that load more evenly. This method solved that problem by giving each partner responsibility for the conception, planning, and execution of household tasks. Part of the game is setting ‚Äúminimum standards of care‚Äù which means making sure you have the same expectations for how each task will be done. This would have eliminated so many disagreements as newlyweds. The downsides: This book stereotypes men in its attempts to get the female reader to connect with the book. It‚Äôs definitely targeted to mothers, although a few spots do share modifications for couples without children. There‚Äôs a few examples of queer relationships, but the writing is not particularly inclusive with most language being aimed at a female reader with a male partner. "
140,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22990116-laura,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book reminded me of All the Rage: Mothers, Fathers, and the Myth of Equal Partnership by Darcy Lockman in how accurately it reflected my frustrations with being the default parent who has to handle everything. Some parts of the book were like they were taken directly from my own thoughts, including why it‚Äôs so maddening when husbands tell us we just need to ‚Äúremind‚Äù them all the time, and how spouses respond poorly to unfulfilled dreams. Rodsky‚Äôs breakdown of tasks into Conception, Planning, and Execution is spot on, and shows why even when spouses think they‚Äôre ‚Äúhelping,‚Äù they‚Äôre often not taking on the mental work and planning that tasks require. Finally, kudos to Rodsky for not only articulating what many women are feeling, but for developing an actionable plan to redistribute tasks more equitably. I haven‚Äôt tried it yet, but it actually seems doable and helpful. So often these types of books leave me feeling heard but hopeless, so I‚Äôm glad Rodsky has offered readers hope in the form of a realistic course of action. "

We are already pretty supportive and equal in our division of labor, so we handle everything with a conversation about specific things rather than playing a game and going through all 100 tasks. However, I felt like her methods of handing out tasks are essentially keeping score over who does what, even though she says they are not. Some of the things are impractical, like never asking your spouse to pick something up from the store if it‚Äôs not on their list? Maybe some of these things would be helpful for some couples somewhere, but it seems like if division of labor is already causing conflicts in your home, her methods would only add to the conflict.Also, this book made me furious at the men who persuade their wife to stay home, don‚Äôt do any of the parenting/ housework, don‚Äôt support their wife‚Äôs hobbies, and then have the nerve to get bored with how ‚Äúuninteresting‚Äù their wife is."

I was happy to find that it offers a real, doable solution to making life more manageable. I was also pleasantly surprised that she acknowledged the fact that even couples without children may need help in dividing up the tasks, as many authors only target parents with their books. I also like that she encourages couples to find time to do what interests them as well as maintaining friendships. While I don't currently find it necessary to enact the full game in my marriage, I like going forward with the ideas presented in the book and the fact that lots of problems can be avoided if we just communicate our needs to our spouses. The game makes it easier for couples to acknowledge their needs as it makes it into a game rather than just complaining. "

Eve Rodsky has created a well researched and ingenious, yet practical system to help resolve resentment and frustration in the household.

As a stay at home mom, I especially appreciated her thoughts on creating what she terms ‚ÄúUnicorn Space.‚Äù While reading this book, I kept thinking, ‚ÄúEve Rodsky definitely knows how I am feeling!‚ÄùBusy, overworked and stressed out moms don‚Äôt worry, you will be able to read this book quickly- I couldn‚Äôt put it down and have been thinking about it for days.

While there were a couple seemingly good tips to test out, I feel efforts would have been better served as formatting simply a card game with a couple page instruction manual. If it was that I could maybe get on board, but 300+ pages? No thanks.I found the content was exhaustively redundant and where she pulls in quotes from other sources to better illustrate her points, there was little evidentiary support provided to expound on the why of how this system should work better so the references seemed disorganized and randomly thrown in to attempt a reach for credibility, but didn't work for me. This coupled with the unrelenting husband/male bashing and 85% one-sided perspectives it was hard to get through."

Providing the framework and easy language of the CPE (Conception/Planning/Execution stages of a task) and MSC (Minimum Standard of Care) will make a huge difference in the way my partner and I organize our lives and communicate about what makes or breaks us, while hopefully allowing more opportunities to think about our self-care, passions, and how we want to share ourselves with others in our community.

146,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/455420-katie-johnson,Rating 5 out of 5,"What a surprise! I assumed this book would just be propaganda pushing the idea that men are selfish jerks who don‚Äôt do their fair share of housework and don‚Äôt care that women do everything. It‚Äôs an innovative system of laying out all aspects of domestic responsibilities and clearly defining and assigning responsibilities. She really enforces the idea that it‚Äôs a win win for everyone, and I really think men and women will be so much happier when using this system. I love how she explains the necessity for both partners to set aside time for ‚Äúunicorn space‚Äù which is a pursuit that develops one‚Äôs passion. Because that‚Äôs how one prevents themselves from becoming boring, and ultimately uninteresting to their partner, themselves, and the world. "

And she is clear about where mental load comes from and the devaluing of time so many people have bought into. I‚Äôm not sure if a ‚Äúgame‚Äù is the complete right approach, but having a physical list and redealing of task cards at least keeps the conversation going between couples. And this is a conversation that needs to keep going. The book itself is a good reference of how to approach the imbalance but it‚Äôs a bit tedious going through all the cards. It reads a bit like the rules to a board game you‚Äôd buy and it‚Äôs odd since you have to then go get the ‚Äúdecks‚Äù online. Probably some more editing could have helped it to be more succinct. "

However, the administration of this system is kind of over the top. I cannot imagine trying to practically add such time and effort to make changes. Some personalities who really love detailed actions and lists and rules for life will benefit, but I was laughing at the idea of myself trying to keep it straight. At the heart of it, marriage and parenting is about relationships. You can use different tools to help structure if you want, but you won't get around simply working together to solve problems and work on goals to improve the day to day of life."

157,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108901487-niki,Rating 4 out of 5,"Fair Play presents a system for making invisible labor visible and redistributing family responsibilities in an equitable way, so that one member of a couple isn‚Äôt stuck shouldering an unfair share of the work that goes into running a household. Using a gamified approach and providing step-by-step instructions, the book walks the initiating partner through how to introduce the Fair Play system, invite their partner to the table, get buy-in, and then play the game. The end result should be not only a more agreeable distribution of household tasks, but also greater clarity about who has ownership of which tasks and how both partners agree those tasks should be done. The author identifies 100 responsibilities couples with children typically have to keep up with and invites couples to customize their own unique ‚Äúdeck‚Äù of responsibilities by whittling that number down based on their family‚Äôs unique needs and values. Then, before the tasks are even divided, the Fair Play system asks couples to consider two things: 1) What is an agreed upon ‚Äúminimum standard‚Äù for each task‚Äôs completion? (emphasis on ‚Äúagreed upon‚Äù) and 2) What is actually required to ‚ÄúCPE‚Äù each task: In other words, what is does it take not only to ‚ÄúExecute‚Äù each task, but to shoulder the mental workload for each task, in the form of ‚ÄúConceptualization‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlanning.‚Äù According to Fair Play, if one member of a couple is going to own a task, fully and completely, they need to be responsible for all of these steps, without coaching or reminders; only then can the other partner truly remove that task from their mental To Do list.After these preliminary steps are completed, then the couple can decide how they want to divvy up the responsibilities. The goal isn‚Äôt necessarily to split the tasks 50/50, but each couple is supposed to come to an agreement about how they want to divide things up, based on both people‚Äôs availability, competency, and preferences. The system also includes steps for ongoing maintenance (i.e. routinely checking in with each other about how the system is working and ‚Äúre-dealing‚Äù cards as needed) and stresses the importance of including ""tasks"" for emotional wellbeing, such as social time and self care. I can‚Äôt give a critique of Fair Play in action, because my husband and I haven‚Äôt used the system yet; however, I will say that I appreciated the topic and liked the book. Even though I don‚Äôt have children and my partner shares responsibility for many of the daily chores (e.g. laundry and dishes), I still find myself being mentally exhausted from all the behind-the-scenes work that it takes to gets things accomplished in our home: Work that I‚Äôm primarily responsible for. Sure, my husband will go buy dog treats when we need them, but who notices when the treats are low, makes the request, tells him what brand we buy, and texts him a photo of the bag? Yes, we send out holiday cards ‚Äúfrom the two of us,‚Äù but who actually takes the photos, gets the cards printed, keeps the address book up-to-date, and addresses and stamps all the envelopes? Multiply this by countless tasks, and you can see how one person in a relationship quickly becomes burned out, tired, and resentful. What I liked most about the book is that it offered an actual system to address discrepancies in household labor, rather than just talking about the problem. As someone who likes rules, games, and systems, the Fair Play approach really spoke to me‚Äîand regardless of whether we adopt the system in my home or not, reading the book definitely got me thinking about equity in our home and motivated me to start a conversation with my partner about our household responsibilities. Because I like visual, tangible things, I also embraced the opportunity to DIY a homemade version of the Fair Play task cards, which my husband and I looked at together over glasses of wine, creating our own 39-card deck. We have a date on the calendar to talk about some version of MSC and CPE for each card, and then we‚Äôll see where it goes from there. Some people might argue that couples can just ‚Äútalk about household responsibilities without needing a book and a complicated system‚Äù‚Äîand while that‚Äôs true, I found that being able to say, ‚ÄúHey, I read this thing and I wanted to talk to you about it,‚Äù went over much better in my relationship than saying, ‚ÄúHey, can we talk about chores?‚Äù I also liked the way the author focused on mutual benefits from using the system, several of which I mentioned to my partner (which I think increased his buy-in.) In terms of my experience with the book itself, I found the audio book (read by the author) to be engaging, and I enjoyed her use of storytelling to bring the concepts to life and make them memorable. Although the author says Fair Play can be used by all couples, one critique I have is that the language in the book (at least the version I listened to) wasn‚Äôt very inclusive of LGBTQA+ relationships: Cards were routinely referred to using gendered language, such as ‚ÄúAdult Friendships (her)‚Äù and ‚ÄúAdult Friendships (him),‚Äù when gender-neutral language would have sufficed (e.g. ‚ÄúAdult Friendships, Partner 1 and Partner 2.‚Äù) In addition, while the author interviewed a lot of couples and included a lot of real-life scenarios in her book, the examples seemed to focus primarily (exclusively?) on middle and upper class families. At the very least, I feel like the book should have included an acknowledgement of the system‚Äôs limitations and areas in need of further exploration.I'm giving the book 4 stars because I think the author tackled an important topic and presented a set of ideas that may work well for some couples. I don't think the system will necessarily work for everyone, but I'm eager to start trying out some of the system in my own family."

I might have benefited more from it when I had small children. It might be most helpful to married women who have children and also work away from home. I understand self pity and self-preserving feelings, but this book is a little more focused on self than I'd prefer. It also doesn't really give credit to some of the complex, tiring, and difficult steps involved in stereotypical male jobs. Even so, there are a few things that were helpful to me. I use this space as a reading journal for myself, so beware, a lot of this review is more about me than the book.I've been married to the same man for almost 33 years and all my children are adults. We have mostly communicated well and naturally worked through solutions to our household responsibilities. We decided to have children right away. I wanted to be a stay-at-home mom. He has always been able to provide financially. Eventually, everything more or less naturally aligned with our talents and interests. I planned to have a career once my children were older, but then we welcomed a child who has Down Syndrome and is also high on the autism spectrum. She's like a two-year-old and needs full-time care. It's complicated, but the bottom line is, I'm still a SAHM even though my daughter is almost 28.I don't love the words ""unicorn time,"" but I appreciate the concept and importance of having personal passions and hobbies. Thankfully, now that my daughter is a little older, and thanks to COVID for my husband being able to work from home, I have had that kind of time. I also had that time when my daughter was still in the school system. There were years in between that were really tough when I should have spoken up for that privilege.I learned years ago that a helper is never in the way and never does it the wrong way. If you think otherwise, people don't want to help anymore. I learned to show a lot of gratitude for every single thing. I learned to ask nicely and make suggestions rather than to nag. Self pity is terrible and pointless. Building a loving relationship solves a lot of problems. This book's ideas are a bit of a short cut, but likely effective.My husband and I divide up care for our daughter. I have the morning routine; he has full responsibility for her bedtime routine. He helps her exercise and sits by her at meal times. There are no complicated systems or ""cards"" in place. We've just worked it out over years. We're good at consistency and habits. We're both reliable.So much pain could be avoided if we communicated everything and didn't let little things bother us. I like that the author shows that if a household duty isn't really important to us, we don't have to do it. Throughout our married life, it has really helped to keep expectations and demands low. At the same time, communicating what really matters is imperative.In this book, I particularly like the concept of ""CPE"" which is conceptualizing, planning, and executing a job from start to finish. That's new to me. The idea of only one person holding a responsibility through the entire conception, planning, and execution makes sense. That way things don't fall through the cracks. We had a situation just yesterday that might have been simpler and less troubling had one of us held the whole responsibility. One of our cars broke down and had to be towed to a dealer to get fixed. He called AAA and the car dealership. I met the tow truck. Usually, my husband deals with car issues, but this car was used by our children and doesn't really matter too much to either of us. Neither of us bothered to make sure the car arrived at the dealership nor checked up on it after its appointment. It wasn't until the dealership was closed that it occurred to me we hadn't heard a word about the car. Did it really make it there and get seen? We called, but realized the best solution was to drive out to the dealership to see it with our own eyes. It was there. It had a tag on the rear view mirror that proved it had been seen. It really wasn't a big deal, but the not-knowing part did cause me to panic a little. We ultimately shared the whole responsibility and solved it together. But maybe if one of us had full responsibility the stress of not knowing if the car was really there might have been avoided. I read this book because a psychologist on Instagram who I occasionally follow highly recommended it. I'm glad I read the book. I'm not sure I'd recommend to it my young-mom-married daughters, but I might. I think there is value in figuring things out without so many rules and gizmos. I will continue to think about this one and possibly implement some of its ideas."
176,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44507080-jennifer,Rating 3 out of 5,"I had a few issues with this work which overall just led to a lower rating. I might use some of the principles in this book, but the overall system is nonsense. Here‚Äôs a few of my major issues:1) It‚Äôs kind of infantilizing toward men. The author repetitively suggests that women essentially threaten their spouse to get them involved in the ‚ÄúFair Play‚Äù game. Things like: I‚Äôll stop nagging you if you participate! We‚Äôll have more/better sex! We‚Äôre playing for the stability of our marriage (aka we‚Äôre looking at divorce if things don‚Äôt change)! The overall tone of getting your spouse involved in this system was manipulative and just kind of icky to me. 2) The 100 task cards have to be purchased separately. Yes. You heard me correctly: you just bought a book to teach you how to play a ‚Äúgame‚Äù but it doesn‚Äôt actually come with the game cards. The author now wants you to go on her website (which she references more than once) and buy her $25 game play cards that you can‚Äôt use the book without. Epic fail.3) The game cards themselves don‚Äôt match every lifestyle (she provides a sample in the book that you can‚Äôt even cut out and use because they‚Äôre double-sided). Which kind of defeats the purpose. A whole card for dry cleaning? We don‚Äôt even do dry cleaning. There are no cards for alternative schooling (anybody a homeschooler out there?), ‚Äúcleaning‚Äù is a sidebar card that shares with other tasks, and some cards are grouped oddly like ‚Äúmedical and healthy living.‚Äù Those are two enormous tasks that need to be separate. Getting your kiddos out for a walk every day or managing their sugar intake isn‚Äôt the same as managing medical appointments. The cards just seemed oddly organized and not applicable to every family. 4) I was pretty insulted by the idea that I need to make myself more interesting to other people. One of the game ‚Äúrules‚Äù is that you need to give yourself permission to be interesting. I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs just ridiculous. I don‚Äôt exist to be interesting to my spouse or my friends. And being a parent IS interesting in and of itself. Not to mention it‚Äôs more than a full-time job. So the entire (lengthy) discussion on being someone interesting outside of your household/parent role and how you have to ‚Äúfind‚Äù the time for extensive passions just fell flat for me. It was insulting to say the least. 5) The system is far too complex to both implement and to manage. The cards are apparently supposed to be constantly re-dealt between you and your spouse? Who on earth has time for that! She said even potentially HOURLY! I was like‚Ä¶..what? That‚Äôs gonna be a no thanks. I‚Äôm not going to renegotiate household responsibilities on an hourly basis. That‚Äôs why most couples are in this situation in the first place. The cards are also interrelated. So if you‚Äôre buying the gift for a kid birthday party you have to consult with the money manager on the cost and also the kid transporter to get them to the party. She suggests you and your spouse meet WEEKLY to re-deal the cards. We barely get a date night once a month much less a weekly timeframe to go over tasking. The amount of additional work that this system creates is just enormous. Overall I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this book unless you have a huge volume of time, extra money to invest in the actual game cards, time to sort through tasks on a constant basis, time to consult with whomever holds related cards to your cards and the wherewithal to keep track of such an extensive tasking system. Because you guessed it! Not only does the book not come with the actual game cards, the tracking of such an extensive system isn‚Äôt designed into the game. You‚Äôre supposed to apparently come up with that one on your own. A simpler more customizable system would make a LOT more sense. "
177,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41411237-samaa-ahmed,Rating 4 out of 5,"I am a single, unmarried, young(ish) woman without kids. I‚Äôm also a proud feminist. For that reason, I‚Äôm interested in most contemporary books about gender dynamics, even if I am not currently experiencing them.I was introduced to this book on the Financial Diet podcast, where the author described how her method was relevant for any couple or group of people managing a household together, including roommates or friends. Despite that introduction, within a few pages of reading, it was clear that Fair Play was written for heterosexual, married, couples with children. I do not currently (and I may not ever) fit into that target demographic.Having said all of that, it was still a good book. I don‚Äôt mean that it was super well written, because it isn‚Äôt, nor did I agree with everything, because I certainly didn‚Äôt.(Three particularly annoying things about the book were:1. The author‚Äôs mischaracterization of the women‚Äôs movement2. Her lack of critique of capitalist patriarchy3. Her babying of men throughout, thus contributing to their weaponized incompetence. Like, men holding 21% of the cards was enough to make most women feel like their relationship load was equitable? What?!)It was a good book because it made me think. It brought a new perspective and problem-solving approach to my life that I hadn‚Äôt considered before. It was well-researched, thorough, and action-oriented. Perhaps I was living in an idealistic world, where I thought the gendered division of labor in the home was no longer such a massive issue, but having read this book, and observed the couples I know, it obviously is. I don‚Äôt think Eve Rodsky wrote an intersectional or universally applicable book. I mean, she barely pays lip service to queer couples, and she writes from a very privileged, white POV. Even with those massive oversights (I‚Äôm being generous that she even considered families that look different than hers), it‚Äôs still a valuable read.It‚Äôs valuable because I am going to bring up these Fair Play issues in my next relationship, and I am going to use ‚Äúobjective‚Äù tools (like the cards and CPEs) to talk about what equity in the domestic sphere should look like. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be clunky, and I won‚Äôt apply everything she suggests in the way that she suggests, but that‚Äôs fine. Books like these aren‚Äôt meant to solve every couple‚Äôs problems - they can‚Äôt possibly account for every quirk and individual preference - but they give us a framework to build upon so that we don‚Äôt have to reinvent the wheel ourselves, each time. And for that, I am thankful."

I had heard it highly recommended by others and I waited on hold for months so I felt a lot of pressure to enjoy it. (Full disclosure; I didn‚Äôt finish it)From page 1, I felt that the author had a very negative view of men‚Äôs capabilities and contributions. She is a working lawyer, a mother and a wife. She seemed to write this book to women who specifically check all those boxes. The book title doesn‚Äôt indicate that the book is geared towards working moms, but that‚Äôs definitely the case. The author dedicated chapters to giving statistics and quotes about the disproportionate home workload of women. This is something that I feel strongly about and have had many conversations about with my spouse. I wanted to read this book because I wanted a practical solution to that problem in my household. I also wanted to better acknowledge my husband‚Äôs contributions. I didn‚Äôt need MORE reasons to be upset. I almost quit after finishing 10% but I kept going. Some aspects of the book did improve for me; I took some notes because I felt they were helpful:‚ÄúHaving to remind your partner to do something, doesn‚Äôt take that something off your list. Rather it adds to it. What‚Äôs more-reminding is often unfairly categorized as nagging. Most men said nagging is what they hate most about being married.‚Äù‚ÄúDelegating the task is not the same as handing over ownership to the task‚Äù‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let your passion be the perfection of your children. Because when you solely define your self in relation to another person, it‚Äôs not enough.‚Äù I also really liked her concept for performing tasks. It‚Äôs not ONLY the executing; there is a lot of behind-the-scenes for each task. The person who is responsible for the task is responsible for conceiving, planning AND executing the task. This is something that‚Äôs actually helpful in my situation. Overall, it just felt like a parenting book instead of a marriage book. She outlined ‚Äúhow to bring this topic up to your spouse‚Äù in the most condescending way, as if coaching someone how to approach their toddler about potty training. It felt demeaning and unhelpful. If you do listen to this audiobook, don‚Äôt listen in front of your spouse until you are convinced that you love it. My husband overheard some of it and I was ok with that because I was trusting the process‚Ä¶now I have some apologizing to do üòÇI‚Äôm mostly upset at my perception of this book because I don‚Äôt want to downplay the real emotional and physical toll that it takes to be the primary caregiver AND the bearer of the mental load to run the day-to-day of a household. I, personally, am exhausted. I need a solution to our current system and I want to find a practical solution that feels like a win for both me and my hard-working husband. I want to feel acknowledged in all the day-to-day coordination that I do (it‚Äôs more than just dishes and laundry). Ultimately, I feel like I waited a long time to read a book that wasn‚Äôt the answer to my problems, and that‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôll keep looking. "
179,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"I was a little afraid to read this book because I have seem so many angry moms referencing it on social media. I think many of those people need to go back and read the book because they are still just stuck on the ""mental load"" piece. It is an important concept, and this book tries to come up with a system that accounts for it. It was a very interesting book, but clearly written by someone at different stage in life, a different income bracket, and a completely different mindset than me. She really, really does not like kids' birthday parties. I sort of wonder if she actually cleans her own house, because of all the cards she comes up with of course ""other kid's birthday parties"" and ""thank you cards"" get a card of their own, but ALL cleaning seems to be one card..so all the vacuuming, toilet scrubbing, dusting, mopping, sweeping, figuring out how to get mold off the shower ceiling gets one card and has the same value as writing some thank you notes?! I had a hard time getting past that. I don't have the background in project management, so having one person do all parts of assigned tasks all the time is unfamiliar to me. I can see where sometimes it makes sense, but she seems to believe that if you help one another out at all you are doing it all wrong. We had an unexpected appliance issue come up recently. In her system, one person would have been responsible for diagnosing the problem, trying what DIY techniques we could to fix the issue, finding the appliance manual, getting up on a ladder, finding the tools, turning off the power, cleaning the appliance, ultimately calling the repair person. Instead, I noticed that we each took parts of the task that made sense for us right then. This book will probably be a good place to start some discussions. I was feeling very resentful before I read it and now I feel like I have some language and tools to help get past that. I will probably not have my husband read the book because it is frankly written for a very specific audience. It reads like a wine mom blog with some references. I applaud the author for creating the system and sharing the book with us all. It appears on Instagram that she is getting input from people outside her little bubble, so it would be interesting to see an updated version at some point. "
180,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6628526-l,Rating 4 out of 5,"I personally loved this, and not because I hate men or because my husband sucks etc. My husband doesn't suck. He's actually awesome and pretty good at leveling the playing field. I can't believe how many women are attacking the author and this book, and yet I can. Many women don't want to acknowledge that their husbands aren't doing enough. My husband does a lot and I think he's awesome, but he still misses things I think should be done because *ding ding ding* he's a man. Fortunately we can laugh about the things he misses and he acknowledges his errors. Then he will finish/continue doing the thing he originally set out to do or that I asked him to do. He rarely says, why didn't you remind me? etc.I have also worked on my perspective and have leveled my expectations because I know my standards are extremely high and I shouldn't expect everyone to meet them. Sometimes you have to learn that ""done"" is better than perfect.I saw one review say that some of the stuff women find important will never be important to men and that they agree with the husband and that some of the tasks the author has on the list are dumb. That is why the author tackles this and says that for some couples, going through each task and discussing the values of certain ones can help both parties find clarity, and they can choose to toss a task out forever, etc. The point is - there is always room for improvement and that's what Eve is attempting to offer here. Many women are carrying the burden of the important tasks that keep the home running and the children happy, and if some women choose not to see that, whether it be in their own marriage or a friend's, are blind. Wake up and smell the coffee. Just because you're not going through it doesn't mean your best friend or your co-worker or family member isn't struggling. Seriously, where is the sister support? It's not an attack on men as much as it is an honest look at the typical situation most (not all) women married with children - to men- find themselves in. If your husband is perfect and is consistently meeting/exceeding your expectations, awesome! Don't read this book. Save yourself that task and keep your comments to yourself."
181,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93751-gail,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is a title that was much talked about in 2019 (especially in the wake of Reese picking it for her book club), so when I saw it on the list of audiobooks I could check out from the library, I thought, ""Well, why not?"" It took a while for my copy to be made available (and wasn't the best timing of reads), but I found it to be a fast listen, and I liked how Rodsky talked in specifics (and gave acronyms to) a lot of the elements related to domestic responsibilities that cause problems among couples. (For example, she points out that ""CPE""‚Äîconceiving, planning, and executing‚Äîof a task needs to be owned by ONE person, and that it's this breakdown‚Äî‚Äîwherein, say, one partner may conceive and plan a grocery list, and the other executes, leading the person who does the last step to think he/she has 'done it all'‚Äî‚Äî to be especially problematic in the division of household labor in the house. (Namely, that women are FAR more likely to do the C and the P, which takes a lot of mental work, with men occasionally helping with E and thinking, ""Look at what I did for the family!,"" if that makes sense.) I've already talked to my husband about the book, and I'd be interested in ""playing the game"" within the Werner house (and he seems amenable to giving it a try), because, while he is better than a lot of men in contributing to division of labor in our home, there are still tasks that‚Äîif we could provide definition to who is holding the card in any given week, as Eve would say‚Äîwe could eliminate the tendency to nag one another about when one of us forgets to do it, or to allow RATS to crop up on us (randomly assigned tasks), which can be equally frustrating and argument-inducing. The elements I took objection to in the book are covered in other reviews here on GoodReads, but I'll add that Eve's term ""unicorn space"" (to define the time partners gift one another to chase their passions) nearly drove me up the wall! (It's so woo woo!) Still, I'm glad I dipped into this one, as the author captures well the daily dilemmas that cause divisions in many of today's modern households."

Yikes. I'm resisting reading too many reviews until I write down my thoughts...Because I LOVED this book. It's my first book reading about the division of labor and it has the potential to be a game changer for me. I even considered gifting this at weddings. (Although maybe not because a lot of people don't like this?) For me the book has value for the idea alone of sitting down with my partner and talking about how labor is divided and doing it on a regular basis. How have I not done this before or even thought of it? Duh.I adored the concept of CPE-conceptualize, plan and execute. It totally makes sense that one spouse should be in charge of CPE and how that could eliminate nagging and miscommunications. Conceptualizing and planning are big responsibilities/burdens and I love the idea of pairing them with execution. I loved the terms the author came up with. I thought unicorn space was cute. I loved RATS-Random Assignments of Tasks. Of course, I appreciated CPE. The game player in me appreciated how the author treated this system like a game. I liked the idea of task cards and playing the game fairly. All of these are terms that will really stick with me. I also loved that the author quoted from other books. I wrote down five or six books to add to my TBR pile. I do feel that the author over-idealized how smoothly this process would go. What happens when one partner's standards are higher than a reasonable person's? *Cough, cough. Asking for a clean freak friend.* There were definitely a lot of grey areas the author breezed right on by. The book also felt geared toward a very specific family type-parents with kids but not many kids. I also felt that an opportunity was wasted by not including kids in the game.Overall, I'm so excited to implement what I learned in this book.5 Stars."
183,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/117820990-nicholas-cato,Rating 2 out of 5,"I've seen this book criticized in Amazon reviews for ""brow-beating"" men. For the most part, I have to agree. The kicker is that I value all of the values of this book. All of them. Rodsky highlights the perpetual, stubborn sexism that makes life worse for women, and she passionately advocates for equality. Women are subjected to an imbalance in domestic work, they are expected to push their careers to the back burner (sexist pun intended), and they are certainly held to high standards for parenting. This has to stop, right? So why did I not like this book?I appreciate that Rodsky uses business concepts in the book. For example, if two people are both responsible for a task, they either waste time or the task goes undone, and each task requires one person to be in charge of the conception, planning, and execution. These are real strategies that could empower couples to make the home more efficient. However, for men who value these values, the problem isn't explaining the values, nor is the solution dozens of anecdotes of men failing. The problem is often communication. When two parents are both working to make it work, the communication strategies used to discuss household labor are paramount. Since both parents are overworked and over-tired, a conversation about unequal divisions of labor will‚Äîof course‚Äîbe a tough topic without carefully crafted communication. The solution is more than a game.If you choose to read the book, be sure to live by‚Äîreally intentionally live by‚Äîthe marked ""Caution!"" notes. These easy-to-skip, half-page breaks in the author's condescension of all men are important for making sure that couples don't further entrench their resentment for each other."
184,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.75 starsThis book has a lot of strengths, and I love that it offers an interesting solution instead of just complaining about the gender gap in the parenting and domestic sphere, but it is lacking in a couple of ways. There are a few examples where it just seems like Rodsky got her way--she and her husband disagreed about how often to take the trash out (his job), and he ended up just doing it every evening like she wanted. Theoretically they discussed it together and agreed on a ""minimum standard of care,"" but that isn't mentioned. At the end, one of their children wants to start a new activity and Rodsky's husband takes it on willingly--what if this wasn't the case and neither of them wanted to do it?Her descriptions of what personality type you are and who you are married to were very specific and reductive. None of the personality types fit me--the only one for working full time was ""Superwoman,"" who does it all and handles it all (DEFINITELY not me); there were two categories for part-time working mothers and one for stay-at-home moms, and even the descriptions beyond the jobs didn't fit me. It just struck me as very odd. I also think some of the cards are very specific and some are extremely broad. I think each family will have to create some of their own due to their own life circumstances. Rodsky is writing the book from her current life perspective with kids all above age four; of course she remembers the younger years, but there are particulars for everyone's circumstances that differ. Even with childcare--there are different tasks depending on whether you have a nanny or daycare, and daycare policies and procedures (such as whether or not they serve food). Rodsky has done a lot of the legwork but I think we'll need to do a little more work with the cards so they reflect the tasks of our lives. I really enjoyed the perspective of a mediator, and I think terms and questions from that field like ""Minimum Standard of Care"" and ""what would a reasonable person do or expect?"" are extremely helpful. CPE, or ""conceive, plan, execute,"" makes the book a worthy read on its own. Although with the cards, I understand the arguments for only one person being the CPE person for a particular card, and yet--that seems like a lot of work for a lot of the cards. I know they can be re-dealt and some often need to, but still. I am interested to try the game, with some tweaks for our family. "
185,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/92899807-lizzie-stewart,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book was essentially an application of business-style approaches to division of domestic labor. The author, Eve Rodsky, advocates that partners should divvy up types of tasks and ensure that one partner takes full responsibility for this task for at least a week at a time. Rodsky emphasizes that tasks involves conception, planning, and execution, and must adhere to a mutually-agreed upon minimum standard. I liked the acknowledgement that the conception and planning portions of tasks often fall, unnoticed, on women, and that giving full ownership to a specific partner is a useful way to decrease arguments. I also appreciated her acknowledgement that each person's time is equally useful, her encouragement of partners to add meaning to their lives through their ""unicorn space"" and the idea of establishing a minimum standard for completing tasks. With that being said, I didn't love the cutesy language/imagery and found myself struggling to buy into the idea of division of labor as a card game. I also struggled to situate myself or my relationship into the relationship structures highlighted in this book. This was clearly written for upper-middle class, white, cisgender, straight women, in families in which the man is the primary breadwinner and the woman is responsible for the majority of tasks related to children and home. In short, I found this book to be semi-useful but irritating in its lack of scope and narrow intended audience."
186,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12463235-megan,Rating 5 out of 5,"A few preliminary notes: If you are not married, don't read this book. If you don't have kids, proceed with caution. This book is entirely meant for families where there is tension around the time and effort spent on household tasks vs. careers vs. hobbies, etc. A huge part of that tension arises when children are in the picture and mothers become the default (or what she calls ""she-fault"") full-time Manager of Home and Offspring with little to no meaningful contribution from their husbands beyond the role of ""primary breadwinner.""Inspired by her own sense of complete dissatisfaction and frustration with the division of labor in her home, Eve Rodsky has developed a ""game"" where couples can determine a more equitable (fair, but not equal) way to manage their home life that will also enable them to free up time and mental space to pursue self-care, health, and passions/hobbies (what Rodsky terms ""Unicorn Space""). She tackles the (sometimes inadvertent) sexism in so many marital relationships that results in husbands and wives spending their time so differently - in an extremely unreasonable and frankly unfair way. The end result is that when we respect our spouses and respect the inherent value in each other's time, we are able to develop a much more healthy family dynamic.The greatest objections I have heard to this book (besides objections from people who aren't the target audience) are that the book is man-hating or ultra-feminist, and that it degrades a ""traditional"" gender role. These objections must coming from people who haven't read the book because Rodsky's ultimate goal is always a happy and successful marriage, which is impossible if one or both parties are struggling with resentment. Content and joyful people create joyful marriages. Men, while typically more at fault when it comes to abdication of home responsibilities, are not solely blamed for any conflict, and women are encouraged to reject a blame game in favor of finding solutions. This book is not solely meant for families where both spouses work outside the home. Resentment and unfairness can still be present when one parent stays at home. Regardless of work status, Rodsky's goal is always an amenable solution to both parties in the marriage. A win-win is what we want, not a winner and a loser. Respect and trust are mutually beneficial and need to be mutually sought and practiced.I have not implemented the specific ""game"" in my own marriage, and honestly I think it would be difficult to do in a military marriage when the active duty member is absent for large amounts of time (perhaps we need a ""Fair Play for Military Couples""?? Eve, consider this my official request!). But as far as principles go, and understanding the hurt and resentment many women feel while still wanting to maintain and develop a healthy marriage, Eve Rodsky really knocks the ball out of the park."

189,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"By no means earth shattering: other than the game-ification conceit this is a fairly common sense approach of naming all household duties and assigning them to one spouse or another - making one person full in the ownership of the task from conception to completion. That said, as the book is tackling what appears to be an extremely widespread and overwhelming problem for opposite-sex couples with children, I'm going to assume that what seems common sense to me probably isn't so much, and the game structure could work to get spouses talking about division of labor where other approaches might fail.I fall into the market demographic for this book but, other than taking the author's advice to more clearly assign single ownership for some tasks that my husband and I tackle jointly and fairly evenly right now without formal discussion (e.g. dishes, certain time-consuming childcare tasks, and cleaning/tidying), most of what is discussed here feels like way too much work for what would be marginal improvements on our current working arrangement.In short - I think this is a good read for married opposite-sex couples with kids who have fallen into stereotypical divisions of labor in which the wife is carrying the overwhelming majority of responsibility for keeping the home.running. if you don't have children and/or your division of labor feels equitable, I don't feel this will be all that revolutionary."

This is centered around heteronormative relationships with kids, which I don‚Äôt think should be too surprising given the author‚Äôs marital status and the gender roles most of us are impacted by. This would certainly work for same sex couples, but you will have to get through the gender role bashing for a little while, which APPARENTLY is super uncomfortable for some women who just don‚Äôt want to think about how dumb their husbands are when it comes to maintaining a family. But think of the poor men!This was also very affirming that my husband and I have a really fair split of household/parenting duties and that our communication style is fantastic (do couples seriously freeze each other out that much, holy god). With that said, I know that both of us have a lot on our plates and carry overlapping mental loads which might benefit from this method. I‚Äôm skeptical of not sharing certain duties (for example pets, omg), but I might get the cards and see what Tim has to say. Efficiency and more ‚Äúunicorn space‚Äù would be quite nice. (Apparently reading is self care and not unicorn space, which I felt to be rude.)Anyway, if you and your partner struggle with imbalances, this is a great intro to a method that might be hugely beneficial."

I heard about it as a book that talks about unfair labor displacement and was very interested bc this has been my life as I‚Äôm sure many other women / female presenting individuals who fall under gender roles. All my life I‚Äôve watched my mom do everything in the domestic sphere. Yes my dad provided financially, which is great but unlike my dad, my mom‚Äôs shift never stopped and has still never stopped to this day because it‚Äôs just expected that she runs everything domestically. Also as the only girl with 3 brothers, i was expected to do household stuff whereas my brother‚Äôs were not. So I want to break that ‚Äògenerational curse‚Äô cuz I see myself mirroring my mother‚Äôs ingrained habits when it comes to my own life & partnership.

192,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9601778-chrissy,Rating 3 out of 5,Liked: idea of having open communication with your spouse on who does what in your home and with your family responsibilities. The idea of 100 discrete items while overwhelming is a great organizational tool to have a real conversation with your spouse. For that - great idea.Disliked: author laughing at her own jokes (audio book); corny and at times antiquated view that women do everything and are married to idiot men that do nothing. I get it - many of us need our husbands help in certain areas or at times want them to step up. However this notion of women as these perfectionistic Pinterest supermoms married to men who are all work and generally have low EQ is dumb and overplayed.Overall it‚Äôs a cool idea and way to get organized but to make this a book there was a need to add filler with way too many stories from random people‚Äôs relationships. I also was left wondering what qualifications the author had to write such a guide. There was very little research quoted beyond cliche quotes which is expected in the self help genre. Agree on the sentiments that this is an odd choice for Reese Witherspoons book club.

Anyway, I kept reading through the rage and I realised where I have been going wrong, how I've been enabling my partner to get away with doing so little in our shared life, and MOST IMPORTANTLY the book shares a way to make the changes necessary to the satisfaction of both parties.This book is the key to the rest of my life, a light at the end of the marriage tunnel, the potential to actually want tolerate living with another human being for the rest of my life.Now I just have to put what I have learnt into action!I still want to read the book about the robot mothers though...."
194,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68056980-shelley,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book does an excellent job of presenting a viable solution to the ancient problem regarding distribution of responsibilities within a two parent family and, best of all, one that elevates both partners to full ownership of tasks/chores/responsibilities that are critical to the care of the family and smooth running of the household; all while eliminating friction, resentment, and lack of prioritizing personal pursuits for both people to insure fulfillment and growth beyond the realm of parenthood-only designation. What makes this all the more refreshing is the author presenting the perspectives/beliefs/societal influences that lay the foundation for the lack of fair distribution to begin with, as well as the challenge to women as well as men to ditch those ideas/opinions that have contributed to the situation. This game plan presents an alternative to the all too common situation of working mothers carrying not only the bulk of the work required to manage both the family and the household, but the increasing burden of resentment that their partner isn‚Äôt helping or only sometimes helping if sufficiently nagged and instructed to do so. Finally, a book that offers sound advice with the expectation and confidence that all adults are able to assume responsibility, take ownership, and execute tasks with competence. "
195,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83979589-sarah,Rating 3 out of 5,"Overall this book made me incredibly thankful for the person I married! üòÇWhat I liked:- Her CPE and MSC concepts are brilliant. It‚Äôs so helpful to think of household tasks as more than simple actions but rather tasks that require conception, planning, and execution. The mental load is often where the heavy lifting happens! Also, discussing and agreeing to a ‚Äúminimum standard of care‚Äù concerning household tasks seems like a sensible way to head off many a conflict. What I did not:- I did not love the ‚Äúyou go girl‚Äù tone. Super infantilizing. - The card descriptions were tedious (hence not finishing the book until my third try) and way too granular (although some might find this valuable). I don‚Äôt find it practical or necessary to have weekly check-ins in order to ‚Äúre-deal‚Äù the deck. - I also didn‚Äôt appreciate how she talked about her husband at times. üò¨ That and some of her conflict scenarios felt immature, whiny, and unnecessarily mean.My biggest takeaway is a vision for clarity and efficiency in the division of home labor. To quote the author, ‚ÄúFair Play is about minimizing disappointment and maximizing ownership and trust.‚Äù I can get behind that. "

The overall book was pretty good, in the audio you can hear the author's frustration towards her husband and came off very hostile at times. I get it, marriage is hard and running your domestic ecosystem is not for the faint hearted. I think that this book did touch on some excellent points and it really reminded me that communication and honesty with your significant other is...well SIGNFICANT! And I say significant other because both parties should be communicating and being honest. I think I prefer the physical book and will reference it as I look at streamlining our household responsibilities. I think one thing that is important is also involving your children with some of the responsibilities she mentioned. My son is 8 and we try to teach him about the responsibility of making sure he has all that he needs for HIS soccer practice. Overall, this was a good read and and some good nuggets.

On the one hand, I like that she systematized home/life management, on other hand, it's just not always so easy to put into practice. Definitely get the physical book (I guess ebook would work) because it lists all of the ""cards"" she uses in her ""game."" (No need to buy the deck of cards that are sold separately.) The concept of CPE (Conception, Planning, & Execution) was super helpful for me to learn about.One issue I have with it is that women can read this and invite their partners to play the game and re-deal cards, but this book is really not written for the male audience (sure they can read it, but some may be turned off by it because she obviously comes from the female perspective and can be negative towards men, e.g. her archetypes of husbands). This means that the men aren't necessarily totally on the same page when playing the game because they haven't been given the background. This means the burden is still on the women to convince them this is all necessary. I wish the concept were presented more neutrally with both audiences in mind so it could be read together or at least by both separately."

There were a few oh yea moments while reading through the first part but overall, like others have said, it was a lot of fluff.I‚Äôd be more interested to hear about readers trying to implement this because it sounds like a logistical nightmare. Having a card, needing to do each and every step of the card (if you sign a kid up for an extra curricular, that person has to do everything involved including all the transportation to and from), re-dealing the cards. The top 13 mistakes seemed like they came from couples who dealt the cards and no longer spoke for the rest of the week. My husband and I have 3 kids, we each have ‚Äúcards‚Äù (I meal plan, he shops for example) but we don‚Äôt expect that person to conceive, plan and execute each ‚Äúcard‚Äù, a lot of stuff is just split; this author really does not believe cards should be split because all hell will break loose. You can each take a ‚Äúcard‚Äù and kid split but splitting multiple ‚Äúcards‚Äù is discouraged. It‚Äôs a nice idea but not one that plays out as easily as this author thinks. "

This book provides a nice framework to streamline how those things get done most efficiently and fairly (not equally) and provides a collaborative language to use when discussing responsibilities. As one example, my husband (who reads these reviews) is awesome about taking on tasks around the house; he definitely does more than me. Yet sometimes I feel like I expend a lot of mental energy keeping track of all the things that need done and making sure he does them. In Fair Play, I learned I ineffectively keep the conception and planning of many of our responsibilities and then hand off the execution, which doesn't set either of us up for success. While I'm not sure we will fully adopt the gamified ""Fair Play"", I do know there concepts here I will put into play moving forward. "

The book helped open my eyes to how much I am doing and how I shouldn‚Äôt be afraid to ask for help and creates a Fair Play ‚Äúgame‚Äù that you can utilize with your spouse to create less stress in managing a household. I admit that I resent my husband (A LOT) for his freedom but this book gave me some insight in how I can manage that and how we can be a team instead.

We have been married for four months and are still trying to find a task management system that works for our household. We do not have kids, but we do share a living space with a dog.I'm giving this book three stars because Rodsky's system would work for us if implemented in the way she describes, albeit with reservations. (I'm more skeptical than Eve is about finding the middle ground on some issues in the implied timeframe.) Even if we were to diverge from the particulars of her system (a card game), it would still provide us with needed structure.While I enjoyed this book more than I expected, I am mostly in agreement with criticisms leveled by other reviewers: the book is too long for its content, is probably too anecdotal for its intended reader, and is clearly written for a select group of women (heterosexual, modern, comfortable, and from a dominant social milieu) despite pretensions to universality. I was also bothered by the author's allusions to her working class childhood, finding them hard to believe and difficult to reconcile with other aspects of her life."

At first, it sounded like it was a really great book, as a discusses all sorts of different ways to bring up the issues about how much work each member of a family has to do. However, I found that it was negatively impacting my marriage. It was causing me to start to have a little pity party about the amount of work that I did, despite the fact that I chose the role that I have in our marriage. I think that maybe this would be a good book for people that may have unintentionally fallen into a different role than they expected for their marriage, but for me, it's not a good fit. I do think that it is a good idea for couples to re-evaluate the distribution of work within their families every few years, or quarters, or as major life changes occur, but the suggestion that every woman is being taken advantage of by every man was a bit hard for me to agree with."

The portions about CPEs of tasks specifically I found very helpful (conception, planning and execution) of tasks as much of the mental load of day to day things is on women in the relationship. I often find myself doing most conception and planning of tasks then trying to get my partner to execute on them and that backfires.The book talked about the number one reason for divorce or resentment from men to their wives is nagging and reminding them to do this and this fair play system serves to eliminate those things.

Particularly the part about how Randomly Assigned Tasks only cause problems, so one needs to own a task from start to finish.Now, the business about the unicorn space.

The book get VERY repetitive in its justifications of the system though. I listened to the audiobook, and honestly there was maybe a half an hour worth of content I felt was applicable when it was over.The author said that she tested this concept with lots of family structures and socioeconomic levels, but it felt to me like it was VERY focused on a two-working-adults-with-kids world. Which... that‚Äôs my life, but it still felt exclusive and not inclusive. I was trying to think of there was anything in here for a single person (with or without kids), or juggling an ex-spouse in with some of these tasks, etc... Those differences in managing the process were not as obvious to me.Finally, I guess my current family structure doesn‚Äôt need this system.

Why should we have to fight for our alone time to pursue passions? Why should we have to convince our partners that our time has equal value? These are all things that I believe SHOULD BE A GIVEN.Unfortunately, that's the way life still works. Granted, that's not the book's fault.I can see this being a great way to combat these societal issues of inequality in the home. I believe that the basic concepts of this book are valid and important, and the Fair Play method can be a good vehicle for important discussions: agreeing to minimum standard of care, family values, and supporting one another's right for alone time and self discovery.I can see this book being substantially useful, and will likely employ it in my own life.

It is so important and so overlooked in feminism overall. However, I felt she should have had more research and less anecdotal evidence (although that made it easier to read and less text-booky, and I have read the research before, but still). She doesn't account for time making money as one of the tasks, which should hold some weight for one or both partners. Also, can't kids do this to help too? She offers a lot of excellent takeaways and I find myself now talking to my husband about which cards I'm owning and there's truth to visibility. Perhaps one day we will sit and go through the cards, but we also aren't in dire need. There is so much here in understanding that women's time is equal to men's and we don't want to do all the mundane shit.

I think you can get one by signing up for the newsletter, but that's kind of an annoying extra step. I actually wish there was a companion book, preferably written by a man (her husband?

Having said that - I appreciate people learn differently and some may value the examples.I‚Äôd also say that when starting it - it felt far more targeted at families (still married parents with children) - rather than just partners in the same household without children.

I wouldn't recommend it as reading for a partner you're trying to get on board.I did really like the idea that taking on a household task needs to include all parts of it--conceptualization, planning, and execution.

Each sentence is real and honest and well-written.

Nice to see that my household already has an appropriate division of tasks, and we value our time equally, the only thing I want to work on is giving myself permission to continue interests/passions/hobbies. Even though we are juggling all the things! And sleepy. Also I love the idea of when you own a chore you own Conceiving, Planning, and Execution. Example is cooking dinner‚Äîthat person owns creating the meal plan, grocery list, shopping, and cooking. Splitting up the task just creates ownership confusion and often the conceiving and planning is just as much work! I‚Äôm going to get the deck to try playing üôÉ"

At its base, it invokes thoughtful engagement and prioritization of domestic responsibilities, and relies on shared goals and respectful communication for success. I support the author‚Äôs main argument to encourage (usually) women to buy-in to this system: ‚ÄúIt allows you to reclaim your right to be interesting *and* interested.‚Äù We are all more than the sum of our un-seen work, and our time has value.

I felt that Rodsky often infantilized men and encouraged women to always take the lead in pursuing change or be pleased that their husbands were at least attempting to take on some of the mental load. Her perspective is very much influenced by her personal experience with her marriage, so that may be why. It is also written for a nuclear family (mom+dad+kids), so some of the information didn‚Äôt apply to me.

Really cool idea and some good examples, but it reads more like a reference book at times and I think if I had a physical copy I probably would have skimmed a lot. I think this book and idea are very much needed. At the same time it a very prescriptive model of how to fix a complex issue. While it is a creative and impactful way to address an important issue, it doesn‚Äôt leave any flexibility or nuance in how it is applied. Great idea.

I love how Rodsky emphasizes trust in one's spouse and the commitment to giving them full control over an entire task.

There are also many examples of how to terribly implement a change in how your family manages household tasks, which can easily cause HUGE marital discord.The author could have approached this subject from a different angle so that both men and women would be excited about the potential this strategy would have on their households. As it is, I do not recommend this book to any men. They will immediately be put on the defense by the approach this author brazenly takes. Women should also proceed with caution. Approach your marriage as a partnership and realize that if there is an imbalance in household responsibilities that both partners contributed (whether consciously or not) to the problem so both partners need to be part of the solution."
235,no user info,No Rating,I‚Äôve read a lot of similar books dealing with division of household work and invisible labor and this one is different in two main ways. 1. It provides extremely practical and specific advice on how to divide labor rather than giving broad generalizations (I.e. ‚Äúdrop the ball.‚Äù). 2. It links the conception and planning aspects of tasks (often the most onerous part) to the actual execution. This frees mental space for the partner not responsible for the task.

I'm aware of this and willing to be more helpful, but somehow my wife always ends up with a heavier load, so we're hopeful this might help us. Worth a shot, anyway.

240,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"Tl,dr: It's a good system. The introduction and lead-in is not great in how it portrays men. But then again, maybe there are just a lot of man-children in the world???If you skip the fluff and go straight to the substance, there is a LOT of substance. The book says a lot of things that are pretty obviously true, but that don't occur to many, many women. Things like a wife's time is just as valuable as her husband's time. Adult men are not children and should not be treated like children when it comes to chores. Use lessons from managing businesses to manage a more efficient household and save time.My main problem with the book is that it's written only for women. Besides the substance of the Fair Play system (called a card game in the book), there are tons of little anecdotes and stories that sound like venting. It's also very one-sided and no husband ever looks good in any of these vents. Even a totally unrelated male stranger on a plane is the target of the author's ire, just because he has very little carry on luggage and plays games on his computer while traveling. Even though the system has a lot of merits, from the way it's presented in the book, it's basically something a wife has to drag her husband into doing until it improves both their lives. I guess I would like help for introducing the system to a husband without them immediately getting defensive (which is what would happen if they read the book).I am impressed that the author has done a TON of work analyzing the tasks that go into running a household with kids. The checklist (with even more detail on her website) is amazing and comprehensive, a very valuable resource. And the system seems very well ""play-tested."" What the author has done is to create a step by step system for communicating with your spouse about household managing / child raising division of labor and expectations in a way that does not point fingers, assign blame, or keep score. I can see how this system can literally save marriages and sanity. I would like more focus on the system and less on the ranting about husbands. Maybe some chapters on common modifications, troubleshooting the game, and non-traditional family arrangements (like divorced co-parenting, same-sex couples, involving grandparents, etc.)."

I was wanting to find a book that will be good for high school students to introduce them to the idea of mental load and of equitable distribution of mental load.

I think it's a good starting place for families who follow outdated traditional family roles where the dad works and the mom does everything else. I hugely agree with making men aware of the gender disparity and the need to contribute more to the household than just money. There were a couple things I definitely didn't agree with but the overall premise I do. I think the most shocking part to me was how many of my fellow book club ladies read this and said that they didn't get much from the book because they were already in a marriage with a healthy partnership and division of labor. That has not been my experience, but I'm working really hard to raise my preteen son to know and do differently and he does fantastic at understanding and helping out with the household labor as much as possible so that hopefully in the future he can have a healthy partnership and raise his children likewise so these good expectations continue."

More of the book was about ""Men should pull their weight,"" which I'm sure is very validating to the right audience, and it's not an unfounded frustration in many cis/hetero relationships, but it does detract from the planning/action, especially if you already have a solid foundation at home."

Perhaps I was just looking for some time management strategies to make my life feel more harmonious, but instead I received a heteronormative guide instructing how to get your husband to do more than the bare minimum. Most of the information in this book did not apply to me, although if I were a straight married woman with kids, I imagine it would be helpful. "

I found this book a great read, but as a childless person married to a neurodivergent person, using Fair Play would need a fair amount of tweaking. I listened to the audiobook version, but I think if you're going to create the cards, it might be helpful to have a paper copy."

If I wasn‚Äôt slow spending right now I would‚Äôve bought the cards like‚Äîyesterday. But why did we spend 50% of the book telling man hating stories? I really hated that.

275,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/664515-patricia,Rating 4 out of 5,"Rodsky proposes a thorough system to shift couples from one person being the captain of all obligations, tasks, and duties leaving the other person to ""help."" Is it a complex system? Yes. Is that what's needed to keep‚Äîlet's just say it: women‚Äîfrom wilting under the strain? Probably. Rodsky carefully walks readers through all aspects of the Fair Play game and provides scripts for discussing division of duties with a spouse. The book focuses mainly on couples with children, but the system can be adapted to couples without children. "

277,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/85701102-ashton-winkelmann,Rating 3 out of 5,"While I find this book to have many things going right for it, I also found myself wondering if the book alienated men from reading and making rash assumptions about the overall purpose of Fair Play. I also spent the first 1/2 of the book deep in my feminine rage, which I feel mixed about. I agree that we need to recognize a problem in order to fix it, but I also think it is harmful to create rage and distress in order to bring your audience to your side. Too often these days, on TikTok, and though my conversations with girl friends we all fall into the same trap of group rage, discussing a problem one of us has and then all piling on until we are all frustrated and mad at our partners for a group issue ""All Men Suck!"", and while the author does move on and discussing how this it negative and the blame game and keeping score is harmful to the process, I don't feel like the author wrote the beginning of the book well enough to prevent that from happing off the bat.I asked one of my guy friends if he would consider participating in Fair Play at the beginning of a relationship, and if these rules and the overall concept worked for him, and I was surprised that he said yes. But once he started listening the the audiobook took a step back and wondered if this was really all the necessary and that there didn't seem to be enough flexibility in the way the game was played. Now it should be noted that I read this book, primitively (I am both single and have no kids) but hear how it was positive in helping make a shared homelife fair and wanted to see what it was about and how it might help me in the future. I am interested in trying it with a future partner. But the big thing I got out of this book was discovering my unicorn space, which is something I am actively trying to do this year and it really resonated with me.Overall, I think this book serves it purpose and that the concept is great in theory and I would have to test it first to know if it works in practice. I just think it could benefit from being written to engage both men and women in the home and be less rage fuel in the beginning. "
278,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1868152-deb,Rating 3 out of 5,"I thought it was a great concept. I wanted to like it more but it got repetitive and honestly, I‚Äôm just not in the stage of life for this.

I like the arguments that domestic work is work and that everyone's time should be valued equally, although those arguments aren't new. The heteronormativity, husband-bashing, and corporate speak that run throughout this book really put me off it. I think there's a way to make domestic work explicit and valued without running into those tropes. "

It would be more useful resource it it was not so focused on being a parent and social expectations of what ""good"" parenting looks like. I am married but I am not yet a parent, I was hoping to read this for blueprints to help lay the foundation for better coparenting when the time comes.

288,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4441822-jami-reed,Rating 3 out of 5,"I love gender studies and liked the general concept here, but it didn‚Äôt resonate with me. The idea is great‚Äîcreate a system that establishes fair, not equal, household responsibilities‚Äîbut it is written with an extremely specific audience in mind and begins pretty negative toward men as a whole. It also spends entirely too long talking about each household card (100!). I did like the discussion of conception, planning, and execution (CPE). Just because one partner executes a task doesn‚Äôt mean that they handled the bulk of the mental load that made it possible. She also stresses the establishment of a minimum standard of care‚Äîwhat a task should look like so that both partners are satisfied. Overall, it‚Äôs unnecessarily long, but it does have some concepts that you could apply to your household to possibly help things run more smoothly. Following the ‚Äúgame‚Äù concept, you can purchase the Fair Play deck. I may check those out! "

I‚Äôve even recommended it to people ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Luckily, after reading it I don‚Äôt have to retract that recommendation.The book is definitely very heteronormative, and definitely has a white middle class privilege vibe thing going on. But for that specific niche, I think it‚Äôs a really important book. You only have to exist for 10 minutes in that space to see how often domestic labor is a sticking point for marriages, with women shouldering the majority of that burden. This book doesn‚Äôt analyze why that is, or moralize about what ‚Äúshould be‚Äù. It‚Äôs just a practical solution manual. The concepts were more personally useful to me ten years ago at the height of my stay at home mom moment, but I‚Äôm still glad it finally got around to reading the book. "

I think the premise of the book is on point, however the execution of the game wasn't that applicable to me. Reading this book offered a lot of excellent discussion points, and I appreciated the examples of how to try to avoid ""doing it all."" I think a lot of people could benefit from reading this book, unfortunately I don't think I'll take the exact approach offered by the game cards. I will take some of the advice of how to talk to my partner about the various tasks it takes to run the home and family. The key takeaway I valued was to speak up before you become overwhelmed and emotional. "

299,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8949680-julie,Rating 2 out of 5,"Although I can see this system working for some couples, I think the overall concept leaves out the very core of a relationship which is teamwork. The author made me cringe at her overall attitude towards men as well."
300,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/422622-autumn,Rating 4 out of 5,"A practical approach that brings invisible work to the forefront, and makes that work everyone‚Äôs job. The author clearly felt it was most politick to tap dance the line between justifiable rage and resentment at the ridiculous gendered imbalances that ‚Äî let‚Äôs be real ‚Äî just drain women of energy and joy their whole lives, and the ‚Äúcalling in, not calling out‚Äù approach. I felt she could have been a bit less preoccupied with how to propose rearrangement of household responsibilities in a non-threatening way. I get that if you want to effect change you have to have a productive convo. It‚Äôs just annoying that said convo is MORE WORK for the woman already juggling a million things. I think it‚Äôs a bit disingenuous not to acknowledge that thoroughly. I think there‚Äôs also a missed opportunity here to talk about repair of trust and respect. Overall, though, really worthwhile. Relevant to any household partnership, but especially to cishet couples where the weight of traditional gender roles is most pronounced. "
