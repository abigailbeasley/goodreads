1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15701318-anna,Rating 5 out of 5,"My second read in the time quintet!And oh boy, how much and why I still enjoy reading children books is just out of my grasp!Charles Wallace, our brilliant and intuitive 6 year old gets ill. He talks about things, that his elder sister Meg, finds impossible to exist. Do they really exist? Does their existence really matter?All of a sudden, it turns out that Charles Wallace's life is important for the survival of our universe. And somehow, Meg alone with the help of certain creatures, has to sort out ways to save her dear younger brother.The components used in the novel: time and size difference between two galaxies (earth and human body), the Proginoskes, Mr. Jenkins, The Teacher Blajney, Echthroi, Sposors and Yadah, all had very strong character development!Compassion, friendship, empathy, sacrifice, care and above all love has been taught as a lesson throughout the story. I believe not only children but sometimes elders should read such magical books to open the gates of our grown up minds to the possibility of impossibilities.Because a lot of lessons taught in this book are not age specific!“Don't try to comprehend with your mind. Your minds are very limited. Use your intuition.”The story tells us that we are nothing alone. Every particle in the universe exists to complement the other and nothing is complete within itself!That in the battle between good and evil, it is good that always wins, no matter how much difficult does it seem in the start!That you can change nothing into everything by the mere acts of love and acceptance!""The temptation for farandola or for man or for star is to stay an immature pleasure-seeker. When we seek our own pleasure as the ultimate good, we place ourselves as the center of the universe. A fara or a man or a star has his place in the universe, but nothing created is the center"" One other lesson this story teaches us is that we cannot have wings unless we are rooted! And we cannot enjoy the vastness of the skies unless our roots are deep down in the ground.It is true, small offspring. Now that I am rooted I am no longer limited by motion. Now I may move anywhere in the universe. I sing with the stars. I dance with the galaxies. I share in the joy-and in the grief. We farae must have our part in the rhythm of the mitochondria, or we cannot be. If we cannot be, then we are not.I loved reading this book as much I loved reading ""A WRINKLE IN TIME"".Undoubtedly, 5 happy, loving, dancing stars!"
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/773097-morgan,Rating 4 out of 5,"Now this is what I'm talking about! If 'A Wrinkle in Time' is hot cocoa, then this book was Ghiredelli's Peppermint Hot Cocoa with marshmallows and $100. Seriously.Trusting the advice of those I loved, I decided to perserver and finish 'The Time Quartet'. So it was onto AWITD and it rooked. Wow, that was me spelling rocked. I thought it was entertaining so I left it for your enjoyment. Anyway, I digress...This book was great. It joins the same crew; Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin, and throws in some new adventurers including dragons. Now, any book that starts off with dragons, is probably going to be a winner in my book. But this time, they are not rescuing their father, or the universe itself (although that could be suggested in a round-about way), but they are trying to save cute Charles Wallace, my fav. I won't really go into the details, but it's good.Again, I was so impressed with her ability to combine Chrisitan beliefs and Scripture with a quantum phsyics/biological fantasty-based adventure story. Wow, that was a wierd sentence. There was just so much good theology in there that I kept thinking about it, chewing on it, applying to my own life. I just really enjoyed it, and the end? Whew! That's what really made it. Can I just say, Progo, I love you and Meg, way to make nothing into something. You rule.Go read this one, it's a winner."
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25108-andy,Rating 1 out of 5,"Is it weird that I really loved A Wrinkle in Time and I fiercely disliked its sequel? I don't remember it being this bad when I read it as a kid, but bad it is. There are hints of the delightful whimsy of the first book, particularly in the Mr. Jenkins face-off and the ""classroom"" meeting with Sporos. But there are many more scenes of purported seriousness which aren't handled well at all. The climactic scenes, which I think were supposed to be moving and exciting, were unbearably ham-fisted and pretentious. Is there seriously a point where, to illustrate the value of love as a weapon against the bad guys, Calvin suddenly remembers some experiment he did on plants as a nine-year-old where he spoke lovingly to one plant and it grew better than the rest? New ""rules"" and random developments get thrown one after the other at the reader. Apparently you have to X yourself under certain circumstances. Blajeny has some kind of immense power but for some reason also must structure the battle for Charles Wallace's life as a series of prophesied tests which Meg (also for no clear reason) has to be the one to pass. ""Deepening"" is very important, in fact the centerpiece of the final struggle, but isn't mentioned until we're basically right there waiting for it to happen - it's as if Frodo goes to Mordor without an explanation as to why, and then all of a sudden at Mount Doom we find out oh and by the way there's some ring and it has lots of power and he needs to destroy it. Its predecessor was a lovely book and its successors are a bit better, but I found this book to be unbelievably disappointing. "
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne,Rating 4 out of 5,"I read A Wrinkle in Time when I was a little kid and never realized that there were more books in the series.And while I'm too old to truly appreciate the magic, I thought I'd read the rest of the books.This wasn't bad, even for a jaded, slightly crusty, heart like mine.As an adult, I found Meg a bit whiny, Charles Wallace a bit of a know-it-all, and the plot somewhat simple. But.There is still that fantasy/sci-fi vibe that runs through these books that holds it all together for me.Or maybe I remember how much I loved these characters as a child, and it brings back the warm fuzzies for me? Either way, I'm grown and I liked it.This time around the kids are a bit older. Charles Wallace is in school and getting his ass kicked on the regular for being weird.And you know what I thought was interesting? His parents had the (not unique idea at the time) to let him figure out how to blend in on his own. You know, without stepping in and fixing it for him.They reasoned that he would have to deal with people for the rest of his life, and it would be a good idea to learn how to handle all the childhood assholes that would eventually grow into adult assholes. There's something to be said for that kind of parenting.No, I'm not saying we should ""bring back bullying"". But I do think that we tend to step in and try to fix too many small hurts for our children now. They need to learn how to cope with the disappointment that comes with not being picked for something, the sadness that comes from not fitting into a certain group, and the embarrassment of standing out when you're a little different. Learning to deal with a teacher who is unfair without mom or dad stepping in will give them the tools to deal with a boss who is unfair when mom or dad can't step in.These are all life skills that you need. Because sometimes life is unfair, people are mean, and you'll want to give up. But. If you survived it once, you will have the emotional recall you'll need to pull on that experience and know you'll survive it again. Anyway.Meg is angry about the whole thing and disgusted with the principal for not stopping it.But the real story here is what's happening inside of Charles Wallace. Something is making him sick, and because these are the Murray kids, the entire universe is in peril because of it.So, like an extra trippy episode of The Magic School Bus, Meg, Calvin, and a few guest stars shrink down and ferret out the evil forces that want to turn us all into NOTHING. Naturally, the kids fight the good fight and learn all the lessons they need to get them to the next book.Good stuff! I'm digging these a lot more than I thought I would.Recommended."
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is the second book about Meg, Charles Wallace, their family and Calvin, their friend. There is no other obvious connection to the first installment other than that time can be bent and the children go on a sort of adventure through the universe.The universe, this time, is the great idea of everything lying within as without. For example, the galaxy is huge to us, making us tiny, and yet we are a part of it. So, too, are the smallest parts of us (like, for example, mitochondria) still a part of us and we are their galaxy.But again, all is not well in this book. Though Meg's and Charles Wallace's father is back with the family, there is great danger coming, namely in form of Charles Wallace getting sick from ""undoing""/""unbeing"". Help is coming, however, as in the first book. Here, in the form of a quite weird angel (cherubim) and a teacher.Thus, Meg and Calvin have to travel and pass certain tests and even travel into within Meg's little brother.Like I said, the idea (though not new) is done quite well. However, this second book in the series was much less light on the subject of religion (like the teacher that must never be questioned, don't ask ""where"", the teacher being all-knowing and all-powerful but not solving the problem himself etc.) and the entire philosophy of love being the eternal answer to everything ... well, that might sound nice in theory but is utterly ridiculous if you think about it. No matter how much love you throw at your enemy, if they don't have the same tactic, you're not gonna get very far. Just like with the concept of ""save one and you save them all"".In this context especially, it was about bullies. The children in Charles Wallace's class as much as the school's principal. While I can make allowances for misguided children, I certainly won't for an adult bullying children under his/her care!So yeah, while I can see this as a story about growing up and being faced with all kinds of problems in the world and having to learn how to deal with them, I don't agree with the solution presented here.The adventure itself, too, was rather bland when compared to the first. No idea why. It had some truly great and promising elements and the writing style itself was very good once again, too, but neither the quest itself nor the characters accompanying the children (especially the cherubim and teacher) were up to the challenge."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/86145-stephanie,Rating 5 out of 5,"there are some things, i think, that you read that will always stick with you. for me, one of those things is the scene in this book with progo, and the discussion he has with meg about the importance of naming. how once you are named, you are - no matter what. i read this later, again, in college, and i read it as a history student, and through that lens, it says fascinating things about the relationship of history and memory, and what history is, and how we leave legacies. like many of l'engle's books, the theological element is present without being completely clear - this was, in a sense, i think her attempt to answer the question of life after death, and also (as all her books question) how bad and good can exist together in a universe created by a loving god. the three mr. jenkins scene is pretty memorable as well, plus the idea of the little farandola in the mitochondria - her images are so clear and creative, such a wonderful blend of fact and fiction. "
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2142955-ali,Rating 5 out of 5,"I feel like this book is too often asked to be another Wrinkle in Time, when in fact its sparse cast of characters and relatively uneventful narrative seem like L'Engle's deliberate effort to make it the opposite. Wrinkle is all about recognizing the universal ""song"" of the cosmos, and stepping into it. A Wind the Door, however, is about recognizing the cosmos already inside the entity of the human being, and how our choices and sense of identity have an immeasurable effect on the song itself. L'Engle makes the point that biologically, we are a galaxy unto ourselves, and she brings this point home by literally reducing her main cast of characters to a molecular level. The bizarre metaphor works, thanks to some beautiful imagery and a palpable sense of world-ending conflict.Once again, there is endless insight into the nature of human relationships, good and evil, faith, science, identity, knowledge, and the subconscious. The concepts of Echthroi and kything are introduced, two ideas and words that have stayed with me since I was very young. L'Engle never writes without something important to say; part of what makes reading her so rewarding. And the older I get, the more her books speak to me. I don't think I'll ever stop returning to them."
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5128242-andrew-leon,Rating 2 out of 5,"I never read this one when I was a kid, so I was coming at it completely fresh. And, at first, I thought it was making a difference in my reception of the book, because, at first, I was really enjoying it. The first third of the book was really good. I was impressed and everything.Yes, there will be spoilers.This one is two years after Wrinkle; Charles Wallace is in school and is having difficulties fitting in. He also thinks he's found a dragon in his brothers' garden. The first part of the book deals with the search for this dragon, and all of that section is interesting and enthralling. Including finding the ""dragon,"" which turns out to be a cherubim. That spouts fire. I'm still not clear on why the cherubim spouted fire, but it did. We also meet Blajeny, a giant obsidian dude who is some kind of Teacher.And that's where the book starts to fall apart. The first thing, which could be overlooked if it was the only thing, is that Calvin just happens to show up as Meg sneaks out to go looking for, well, she doesn't know what she's looking for. In fact, there's no clear reason why she sneaks out of the house. Here's the conundrum: It's after bedtime. Meg sneaks out, which is not the issue; the issue is that Calvin just shows up. Sure, he has his own reason for being there but, ostensibly, he should know that it's after the Murry children's bedtime, so why is he coming over to their house when Meg and Charles Wallace are expected to be asleep?The next real issue is Blajeny. He's supposed to be a ""Teacher,"" a term which is never really explained and, I suppose, shouldn't need to be explained except that he never teaches or does anything like teaching. What he does is announce to Meg that he is there to be her Teacher and that she will have three trials. So this is his method of teaching, to announce that she will have trials but, oh, he can't tell her what they will be or how to overcome them. He will, though, giver her the cherubim, Proginoskes, as a partner but, no, he doesn't know what the trials will be, either. This is another one of those tropes that I am overly tired of. And, well, how would Blajeny even know how many trials there would be if he didn't know what they would be, something he admits later. Basically, this was some ordeal he, some very powerful cosmic being, couldn't fix himself and needed Meg, a teenager, to do it for him.Most of the rest of the book is torture. As soon as they get to the first trial, which is to determine the real Mr. Jenkins... Okay, hold on a moment. There was this scene in Wrinkle with Mr. Jenkins where he is questioning Meg about the whereabouts of her father. He seems to have an overly intense curiosity about it. Meg even wonders why Mr. Jenkins cares, basically, calls attention to the behavior to the reader, then... nothing. The character doesn't enter the book again, and I was left wondering what the heck that was all about. When he turned up in Wind, I thought, ""Oh! We'll get to find out what Jenkins is up to"" But no. Jenkins is up to nothing except being lame.So, okay, Meg has to figure out which is the real Mr. Jenkins because he's been copied by fallen angels called Echthroi who want to X existence. But to start with, they want to X Charles Wallace. Yes, the ""X""ing is how it is put in the book. They want to X everything. Why they copied Mr. Jenkins is never explained and has no logic to it other than a contrivance because Meg hates Jenkins but has been put into a position where she has to save him. What we get, then, is two chapters of Meg whining about how she can't do it and Proginoskes telling her she has to or he will X himself. They just kept going around and around that argument:""I can't do it.""""You have to.""""I can't.""""Then I will fail the trial and will have to X myself.""""No, you can't do that.""""Then you have to choose."" (Or, as they said in the book, she had to Name him.)""I can't do it.""OH MY GOSH! Seriously! I needed two chapters of that! (More than 30 pages in the edition I read (nearly 1/5 of the book).)And once they get through that? Well, Jenkins joins their little team and we spend most of the rest of the book bouncing back and forth between him and Meg both going on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on about how they can't do whatever it is they need to do. Oh, yes, and Jenkins asking to just be sent back to Earth. ""I'm no good. Why am I even here? Just send me back."" Or something to that effect.Not to mention that, again, the person (Blajeny in this one) provided who should be able to answer questions and explain what's going on and what to do and all of that fails to answer any questions and leaves them on their own to figure out what to do. Which, you know, sometimes is what you need to do with kids but not when someone's life is in the balance. It would be like coming up on a car accident and the ambulance is there, but the EMT tells you to take care of it instead then refuses to answer any questions about what you should do and, in fact, wanders off when you're focused on the guy bleeding out.Mostly, I have found these books, so far, to be a place for L'Engle to dangle her ideas and philosophies with not enough story to really make the books worthwhile. Both books have focused on love as major plot device (the climax of the Wrinkle being Meg saving her brother by, basically, saying ""I love you""). The message, then, of A Wind in the Door is that love is an action, not a feeling, and that's something I agree with, but I don't need 50 pages of anguish over it. I also don't need half of the book explaining and re-explaining ""kything.""So, as I said last time, these books may be great for kids, but I'm just not being able to get into them as an adult. There are too many shortcuts and too many devices without reason and not enough answers both to the questions the characters have and the questions that I have as a reader. If you loved these as a kid, cherish that, but don't try to go back to them now. If you never read them, it's probably better to just not."
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/260846-andrea-fontana,Rating 1 out of 5,Yawn. This book gave me anxiety attacks by imprisioning me in the same scene for 30+ chapters. Goes absolutely nowhere. I can't believe it's even related to A Wrinkle in Time. No wonder I'd never read it in school.
10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25955835-hotsake-andr-troesch,Rating 2 out of 5,High in concept but very heavyhanded and filled with repetitive and secular dialogue.I will give the third book a try but if it doesn't get better I'm going to drop the series.
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/84916113-daisy-mae,Rating 5 out of 5,"“We don’t have to know everything at once. We just do one thing at a time, as it is given us to do.” You know when you read a book, you absolutely adore it and want so much more of it, and then it turns out it's a series so you pick up the second one and you are terrified it's not going to be up to your expectations? Well, it didn't happen to me with this one. I think the first book in this series is one of the most stunning books ever written, and I had so much faith in the author that I was sure 100% this one would be as well. And I was right. If you want to know what I think about this book, go check my review of the first one. But I should warn you: it's just the rambling speech of a woman in love. Man, do i love this series!!!"
12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29005117-federico-dn,Rating 2 out of 5," Kinda Disappointing.  Meg’s brother Charles Wallace is being bullied at school, and he’s developing an incurable disease. A malign influence is stirring around the Murry family, and the life of little Charles Wallace may be at stake, and possibly the whole universe. From far away distant planets to the inside of cellular mitochondria; Meg, Calvin and Proginoskes fight the evil Echthroi, trying to save Charles Wallace’s life, and restore peace and harmony to the universe before it’s too late. This was one weird reading; overall ok, but not especially remarkable, or recommendable. It was certainly interesting up to a certain point, with a few memorable moments to remember by. Quite enjoyed Mr. Jenkins conversion process, and the fantastic journey to the land of the Farandolae, home of invisible entities that bind the universe together (Midi-chlorians?). Sadly, the rest of the book was mostly boring, and kind of preachy. I think most of that sweet candor and warm tenderness that resonated so strongly with me in the first book was missing in this one.A sequel that in essence couldn’t live up to its wonderful start, and can be read as a standalone, since though the characters remain the same, the events or #1 barely have any consequence in this new installment. Maybe even skippable? Can’t tell since I haven’t finished the series yet; but plan to, someday.-----------------------------------------------
PERSONAL NOTE
: [1973] [236p] [Fantasy] [2.5] [Not Recommendable] [Sporos <3]-----------------------------------------------★★★★☆  1. A Wrinkle in Time ★★☆☆☆  2. A Wind in the Door  [2.5]----------------------------------------------- Algo Decepcionante.  Charles Wallace, el hermano de Meg, es acosado en la escuela, y está desarrollando una enfermedad incurable. Una maligna influencia se cierne sobra la familia Murry, y la vida del pequeño Charles esté en juego, y posiblemente el resto del universo.Desde lejanos planetas distantes hasta el interior de la mitocondria celular; Meg, Calvin y Proginoskes luchan contra los malvados Echthrois, tratando de salvar la vida de Charles Wallace, y restaurar la paz y harmonía al universo antes de que sea demasiado tarde.Esta fue una lectura bastante extraña; dentro de todo bien, pero no especialmente destacable, o recomendable. Ciertamente fue interesante hasta cierto punto, con algunos momentos memorables para el recuerdo. Disfruté bastante el proceso de conversión del Sr. Jenkins, y el fantástico viaje a la tierra de Farandolae, hogar de invisibles entidades que mantienen unido el universo (¿Midiclorianos?). Lamentablemente el resto del libro fue mayormente aburrido, y algo sermoneador. Creo que la mayoría de ese dulce candor y cálida ternura que resonaron tan fuertemente en el primer libro faltó esta vez.Una secuela que en esencia no alcanzó su maravilloso comienzo, y que puede leerse como libro solitario, ya que aunque los personajes siguen siendo los mismos, los eventos de #1 apenas si tienen alguna consecuencia en esta nueva entrega. ¿Tal vez salteable? No puedo decir ya que todavía no terminé la serie; pero planeo hacerlo, algún día. -----------------------------------------------

13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13716524-evelina-avalinahsbooks,Rating 3 out of 5,"2023 update: 3 stars (previously 4)A wind in the door starts out much darker than the first book in the installment - A wrinkle in time. While this one centers on the idea of good prevailing same as the first book did, I suppose it takes into account that the reader has grown a little since the release of the first book, and therefore comes across much darker than A wrinkle in time did (it's something we have observed with the story of Harry Potter as well).The thing I love best about the books of this series is how they treat children as.. just smaller normal people. They don't simplify the narrative, they expect children to be as smart as grown-ups (an idea a lot of children's books lack, unfortunately). We need to treat our children with the respect they should grow into - already seeing the child as smart and strong we want him to be, and not simplify the world for him so he has nothing to strive for. But enough of going on tangents. Onto the book.The Murry family lives in a world where good is always at battle with evil. They do not live in a mundane civilization we seem to live in, instead they are living in a world of breathing creation, fight for the good and prevalence of love and understanding over darkness and ignorance - a world of much bigger things going on behind our daily existence. This is shown not merely through the parents' scientific work to advance humanity, but their spiritual strength and the way they protect their children from this battle, and yet instill their virtues in them. This is where the book's 'spirituality' comes in - a kind of spirituality that could apply for any religion or tradition, although they tend to be thought of as Christian (a label I am not sure of - it seems more New Age for me).Meanwhile, the children take their own part in this battle while strange, magical things happen to them. I'm not going to tell you what happens cause you're not here to read my spoilers. But I'll say that I love how in this book all of the 'peace workers' (my term) do their work the way they think best. Like fighting different battles on different fronts - in the same war. And what it takes is ultimate belief in the ones wiser than you, using your heart over your brain and generally having a conscience - all things that reverberate through other literature of the more spiritual kind that I have read.Ultimately, this book teaches that you need to take everything the way it is, understand it and perhaps love it as much because of its weaknesses as its strengths. It teaches that if we want to be free from hate, we must stop seeing with the eyes of hate and seeing things that are darker than they really are. But at the same time, that seeing things better than they are is no better either. These are lessons every child should learn, and many an adult, cause most of us will have missed them when we were growing up. Apart from that, it teaches the importance of holding together and hints at how humans prefer to live egoistically and imagine they are the center of the universe. This is meant both in the sense of humanity as an item, and every single person that makes up humanity. It talks about how important it is to make the right choice about your life and your actions, and regrets the fact that many people are blinded by culture and just think of themselves.Read this to your kids. Read this to your own inner child.Some of my favourite quotes:""There are still stars which move in ordered and beautiful rhythm. There are still people in this world who keep promises. Even little ones, like your cooking stew over your Bunsen burner. You may be in the middle of an experiment, but you still remember to feed your family. That's enough to keep my heart optimistic, no matter how pessimistic my mind.""""When we seek our own pleasure as the ultimate good we place ourselves as the center of the universe. A fara or a man or a star has its place in the universe, but nothing created is the center.""""But a child-"" Mr Jenkins asked. ""Mod small child - why is he so important?"" ""It is the pattern throughout Creation. One child, one man, can swing the balance of the universe. In your own Earth history what would have happened if Charlemagne had fallen at Roncesvalles? One minor skirmish?"" ""It would have been an Echtroi victory?"" ""And woos history would have been even darker than it is."""

What is wrong with society that being smart is bad, but bullying is considered normal and something you just have to deal with.Bull! It shouldn't just be something to deal with.

19,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1580795-christina,Rating 2 out of 5,"Talk about strange... This book has a strange resemblance to an episode of the Magic School Bus where they travel inside one of the students... Only that was more believable. I think where L'Engle loses me is that she feels like she needs to explain everything - why not just leave it at - Charles is sick and we are going inside of him to fix what's wrong - see, I just said the same thing she did only she took half the book to say it. Sometimes its better just to leave it to our imagination. If you attempt to explain everything than there's no imagination left to it.I am not saying there is no imagination to this book - there is - it's just not nearly on the level of her first.And, I'm not sure what L'Engle was trying to do with pushing the idea of conformity. ""If your different - you'd better learn to blend in or your never going to make it""... I can see a kernel of truth to that - but I'm not sure that makes it right."

The audiobook was better, as the narrator was fantastic, but there was no shaking the realisation that the story had become rather... preachy.Still, it had wonderful, lovable, quirky characters, gorgeously surreal settings, and a pure grey chill at its core that made the stakes feel constantly high.Hoping for more of the good, I decided to continue the series.I wish I hadn't.The preachiness is out in full force: A Wind in the Door is less an actual story with characters, setting and/or plot, and more a droning parable, a barely-coated allegory that feels more like listening to a sermon than anything else. Meg's impatience and doubt has grown from annoying but understandable character trait-in-development to unbearable whine, and the balancing forces of Calvin and Charles Wallace were almost completely absent. Mr Jenkins is, for some reason, a central character here, and every single character seems to have developed amnesia and forgotten they ever went on a remarkable, life-changing, galaxy-crossing adventure just a year or so before. For someone who has been coaxed back to life by Aunt Beast, and flown to the stars on the winged back of Mrs Whatsit, Meg is strangely unwilling to believe Charles Wallace when he tells her there are dragons in the garden.There are a few redeeming moments. The narrator is, again, splendid, and the imagery of the farandolae (which I imagined spelt ""phyrandallae"" or some such - the ""f"" comes as a disappointment) is quite lovely. Plus the word Echthroi, which is sorely underused for such a fantastic sounding thing, is most definitely attended to here.I'm looking forward to the film series, but won't be reading any more of the books I'm afraid.Note: it seems as though the initial concept for this came from L'Engle's short story Intergalactic P.S. 3, which from a brief Wikipedia summary sounds far more enjoyable."

I really liked this one more than book 1. I think this one was just more exciting and I cared about the characters a bit more. My only issue honestly is that this can't be a children's book. I BARELY understood what I read, so how can a child understand? Still unsure about continuing on the series. But it was better. "
23,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2970379-manybooks,Rating 4 out of 5,"Yes and definitely, I must admit that I have found A Wind in the Door (the second instalment of Madeleine L'Engle's Time Quintet series) quite a bit more readable and as such also much more readily approachable on an emotional and inner child level than the first book, than A Wrinkle in Time, and mostly so because in my humble opinion, two of the main characters of A Wind in the Door, since both Meg and her younger brother Charles Wallace Murry feel much less annoyingly and problematically depicted by L'Engle in A Wind in the Door than how they present themselves and act in A Wrinkle in Time (and Calvin O'Keefe as well to a point, since in A Wind in the Door Calvin no longer seems all nasty regarding his mother because of her supposedly being physically ugly, which really does majorly bother me in A Wrinkle in Time). For Charles Wallace in particular with regard to A Wind in the Door, even with him still being shown by Madeleine L'Engle as a total genius and an intellectual prodigy, he fortunately also demonstrates none of the grating and cringeworthy smugness and haughtiness that is pretty constantly being emanated by him in A Wrinkle in Time. And well, this arrogance and swagger certainly does make Charles Wallace not only rather unsympathetic as a character for and to me in A Wrinkle in Time but also renders me as a reader not all that engaged with him or even remotely interested in him, whereas the considerably less self-centred and lacking in annoying hubris Charles Wallace of A Wind in the Door, I do really and absolutely enjoy as a person (and right from his first utterances in A Wind in the Door) and thus majorly also feel for Charles Wallace regarding the horrid bullying he is experiencing at school and of course am also totally textually engaged when his older sister Meg and her friend Calvin O'Keefe travel inside of Charles Wallace's ailing body to save him from a toxic disease caused by the cosmic creation destroying echthroi (biblical, universal, straddling time and space enemies). And while Charles Wallace's sister Meg in A Wind in the Door definitely needs to learn that love is all encompassing and not just meant for a select few individuals (like for example her immediate family), that Meg Murry needs to appreciate and to love the entire universe (and even unsympathetic or seemingly unsympathetic individuals like school principal Mr. Jenkins), the Meg from A Wind in the Door is still for me much much more likeable than she is in A Wrinkle in Time (because she and right from the onset of A Wind in the Door is pretty open to receiving and feeling love and is not like how Meg Murry is depicted by Madeleine L'Engle in A Wrinkle in Time, someone with a large universal chip on her shoulders and rather against everything and rather constantly complaining even though she has so many positives in her life, like a supportive and totally non dysfunctional family).However, while my inner child totally loves A Wind in the Door, my adult self does have a few points of reading contention with regard to parts of Madeleine L'Engle's storyline, with her featured contents and thematics. For one, how seemingly quickly in A Wind in the Door Meg learns to totally accept and internalise universal love and equally how easily Meg Murry is able to differentiate between the fake Mr. Jenkinses, save the real one and then travel with Calvin into Charles Wallace to save him does feel a trifle too facile, too fast and as such also a bit too easy. And for two, and considerably more of a problem (at least for my adult self), yes, I do have to wonder a bit that Madeleine L'Engle makes everything bad and horrible occurring in A Wind in the Door (including the bullying Charles Wallace is experiencing and his illness) somehow be the fault of universal evil, of the etchroi, since for me, diseases just happen and that honestly, having children read in A Wind in the Door that Charles Wallace's mitochonditris is seemingly the result of evil entities, this certainly kind of rubs me the wrong proverbial way a bit (as does the idea of Charles Wallace's bullying also being caused by some esotherical malice, since frankly this kind of sounds rather like making excuses and somewhat like an the Devil made me do it attitude)."

25,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22306206-neil-r-coulter,Rating 5 out of 5,"I've loved this series since I was a kid, but this is my first time reading them aloud to my own kids as bedtime stories. It's very interesting revisiting them now, both through my eyes and theirs. One of the things that I most enjoy about L'Engle's fantasy novels is that they come from a time when a movie adaptation was not inevitable. So many of the YA novels I've read from recent years seem to exist solely to be turned into a blockbuster movie series--almost as if the book is begrudgingly being written only because there has to be a book to base the movie on. Not so with the Wrinkle in Time series (though at least that first book has had some adaptation attempts, and another on the way next year). L'Engle wasn't imagining this story on the big screen, and so she creates scenes that feel more bizarre, more alien, than so much of recent YA fiction. I like that.It was true of A Wrinkle in Time, and it's even more true of A Wind in the Door, whose climactic confrontation takes place at a microcosmic level, and the ""action"" is happening, in a way, just in the minds of the characters themselves. ""Where doesn't matter,"" Meg is repeatedly told. (How would you film a climactic confrontation where the location has nothing to do with it?)The first book dealt with some very big themes, but the second volume expands even further, and I find it much more satisfying and unified. A Wind in the Door challenges us to see past external appearances, and our own feelings and judgments. Instead, we're shown the way to name people, even those we despise, and fill up the emptiness that threatens the universe with love and self-sacrifice. L'Engle also shows that the challenge is not a one-off test; we will face these tests again and again and again, and every time we will feel pain and fear as we make our decisions.In A Wrinkle in Time, the protagonists are whisked away to other worlds for their adventures, but in A Wind in the Door, L'Engle more or less keeps her characters on Earth, and she opens doors in our world to show us the magic and mysticism that is all around us, if only we would take notice. There's a bit of this in the end of the Narnia series (which L'Engle is clearly very influenced by, especially in the climactic ""naming"" scene, which is so reminiscent of Aslan's naming at creation in The Magician's Nephew), but maybe it's more clearly echoed in Harry Potter, where a character's eyes are opened to the magical world coexisting with what we'd thought was the ""real"" world (though even in that series, it's limited to Earth; for L'Engle, the entire universe is fair game). Whatever the case, this is a tradition of fantasy novels that I love when it's done well; and I believe it is in this book.There are problems with A Wind in the Door, the strangest of which is trying to figure out when this story is supposed to take place. The first book was published in 1962, and this one in 1973, and most of the details suggest a 1960s/1970s America. But then there are odd references to an adult character who remembers watching the moon landing, seemingly many years before. And we've sent men to Mars in this fictional world! So I have no idea what L'Engle was imagining. I guess if the upcoming movie is set in 2018, or even later in the future, that won't be a problem.Another continuity oddity is that the adventures of the first book are almost never mentioned in this one. I would imagine that an intergalactic rescue mission in which the fate of your father and brother were up to you would leave some residue in your day-to-day life and your relationships with the other people involved. In this world, it doesn't. It's almost as if this is a parallel universe in which the first story didn't happen, or isn't remembered, or something.The final problem is more difficult, and that is that in this story, Charles Wallace is being bullied mercilessly in school, every day. The solution: he just needs to adapt and get used to it. What?? That's a detail that's hard to take, and it makes every adult in the story--especially Charles Wallace's parents--seem either weak or insidious. It's a very odd lesson, and it's hard to imagine that it made more sense in 1973 than it does now.For me, however, the problems do not spoil what is truly great about this novel. It is strange and quirky, and it has a lot of truth about humanity and the cosmos."

Somehow I never got around to reading the sequel The Wind in the Door until now. Who knew that I hadn’t missed much?Madeleine L’Engle created Meg Murry long before anyone ever heard of The X-Files’ Dana Scully, of course, but they’re two peas in a pod. Meg traveled all over the cosmos with her whiz-kid little brother Charles Wallace Murry, thanks to magical beings and the fifth dimension, for God’s sake — but she draws the line at dragons? Really? What’s it take for you to believe, Scully Meg?From that initial annoyance, we move onto a new adventure for the Murry children. Yes, big man on campus Calvin O’Keefe joins Meg, as in A Wrinkle in Time — but so does former principal of Meg’s high school, the ineffectual, inflexible Mr. Jenkins. The ensuing quest proves as annoying as Meg’s unrealistic resistance to the magic that surrounds Charles Wallace — despite including a feathered cherubim straight out of the Book of Ezekiel, a sentient snake, and an assortment of other supernatural creatures. To tell you any more would be to spoil A Wind in the Door for those who still care. That would not include me."

I remember thinking the same thing when I read A Wrinkle in Time in high school. My boyfriend at the time advised me not to continue with the series because Charles Wallace, hands down the best character, appears less and less.He was right - I shouldn't have continued, and not just because of Charles Wallace. Reading A Wind in the Door, I kept wondering why L'Engle chose to analogize concepts like empathy, love, emptiness, maturity, and valuation of all life, with her own awkwardly explained equivalents like ""kything,"" ""Deepening,"" and ""Echthroi."" It would take an exceptional tween to read between the lines of this book, much less the rest of the series.Yeesh. I thought I wanted to finally finish this series, but now I recall why I never did. It took too long to read this boring, unnecessarily obtuse 200+ pager. I had to force myself to finish and I'll not be continuing the series.

30,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2177891-kat-hooper,Rating 4 out of 5,"Originally posted at Fantasy Literature. Life's too short to read bad books!http://www.fantasyliterature.com/revi...When I was a kid, Madeleine L’Engle’s A Wrinkle in Time blew my mind. I’m sure that’s why I remember it as one of my favorite childhood books. Reading it gave me the first inkling of the immenseness of the universe and that the concepts of space and time were much more complicated than I had realized. I think it was also the book that started my life-long love of science fiction. Before that, I had no idea that I loved having my mind blown! It’s surprising then that I never read the sequels to A Wrinkle in Time. I don’t think I was aware of them until years later and then I probably thought of them as children’s books and passed them by. That was a big mistake which I’ve now corrected.The first sequel, published eleven years later (in 1973) is A Wind in the Door. Meg is now in high school and Mr. Jenkins, the principal she so much dislikes, has been demoted to run the school that Meg’s little brother Charles Wallace attends. Meg is angry with Mr. Jenkins because he can’t control the bullies who are ganging up on Charles. Meanwhile Charles has become sickly and Meg’s mother, a microbiologist with two PhDs, suspects there’s something wrong with his mitochondria, the organelles that provide our cells’ energy. She theorizes the existence of even smaller cellular elements called farandolae (these are not real) that live in the mitochondria and are, in Charles Wallace’s case, being destroyed. As Charles languishes, Meg, Mr. Jenkins and a cherubim named Proginoskes go on a journey that they hope will save his life because, according to what they learn, if Charles dies, the whole world, and maybe even the universe, will be in danger. For there is an epic battle between the forces of good and evil and little Charles Wallace is a key player.A Wind in the Door is a children’s story, but it’s full of the same kind of mind-expanding science fiction ideas and mature philosophical themes that I experienced when I first read A Wrinkle in Time. In addition to addressing the complexities of time, including whether time really has any meaning at all outside of our planet, L’Engle attempts to give us a feeling for the vastness of the universe by comparing and contrasting the size of our galaxy with the size of the organelles in our cells. She shows us that not only are we ignorant of what goes on in our universe, but the same is true for what goes on in the bodies we inhabit.As with A Wrinkle in Time, there is a definite but subtle religious (Christian) subtext to the story, too. (L’Engle was a Christian.) The struggle going on in the cells of Charles Wallace’s body is a metaphor for the greater struggle between good and evil. The epic evil of the story is in the form of creatures called Echthroi which appear to be fallen angels. The good force is the creator of the universe which we can assume is the Christian God because there are a couple of Biblical quotations and several Biblical concepts such as the creation singing of its creator, the importance and power of love as an action (not just a feeling), the idea that people are everlasting souls that are known and “named” by God and that they can grow in spiritual maturity, the idea that people who seem insignificant to the world can greatly impact its future, and the notion that a sacrifice can be redemptive.Many younger children will not pick up on all these ideas and will likely find some of the contemplative parts too slow, but most children will be able to get something out of the story such as the important message that a person’s appearance and mannerisms are not as important as what’s inside, and that love is a choice we can make.Jennifer Ehle narrates Listening Library’s audio version of A Wind in the Door. My daughter and I enjoyed her performance and look forward to hearing her read the next book, A Swiftly Tilting Planet."
31,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/541416-teresa,Rating 3 out of 5,"I see that my childhood copy of A Wrinkle in Time is from 1968. This companion novel, the second of the so-called Kairos series, was published in 1973. By that time I had read the first novel who knows how many times; and I didn’t know of its companion until I was an adult and read it when my son was reading the quartet. I now own this beautiful edition: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3... , so I’m rereading the books (along with their respective endnotes) but reviewing them separately.I stress that this is a companion novel, though it’s also a sequel in time, as in its beginning I thought there’d be acknowledgement of Meg’s mental state due to her prior adventures as she faces more bizarre circumstances. As a child I think I would’ve been confused at that lack, though later there is one oblique reference to what has happened to Meg and her youngest brother in the earlier book.L’Engle is such a great storyteller that, of course, she kept me reading; but I’m not sure I would’ve read this one more than once as a child, even though it does advance the growth of Meg, and her relationships with others. Either L’Engle was prescient or not much has changed since the late 60s/early 70s, because the state of the world she describes in this book has much to say to our present time period."

This one was narrated by the author. The intro at the beginning about the science is this book was a welcome addition, but I did prefer the audio production on Wrinkle to Wind.This story was a wonderful continuation of Meg's growth in wisdom and stature. Meg and Calvin learn that to our mitochondria, ourselves are as big to them as a whole galaxy is to us. I am reminded of two verses in the Psalms:""When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, what is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him? Psalm 8: 3-4and also""I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well.""

I found the book a thrill ride and full of excitement and felt childlike awe throughout.I'll be reading it again, and plan to read the other three in the series, as well as her other books.

Estos libros middle-grade son perfectos para que los lean desde niños hasta adultos. El mensaje que me cautivó desde la primera entrega fue el amor de una hermana por su hermano pequeño. El que una persona sea ""diferente"" no quiere decir que deba ser sujeto de críticas, rechazo o violencia. Tenemos que abrir nuestra mente para comprender a aquellos a quienes consideramos diferentes a nosotros.Como mensaje de la segunda parte puedo añadir la importancia que se le debe de dar a cada persona, todos somos importantes por más insignificantes que seamos para el universo, toda criatura, toda planta tiene su valor.

Although bursting with interplanetary acclimatization, complicated concepts, and unprecedented stressful ordeals the characters are instantly relatable. Margaret L'Engle knew that feelings, friends, and family are universal. Although she described alarming places and personages: emotions and an understandable human concern formed the axis of her narrating style.Familial jabbering in ""A Wind In The Door"" should have been curbed. Hot chocolate was referred to through four pages (the American synonym I dislike), instead of being stated once as an irrelevant background. Sandy and Dennys seem like useless offspring and the Father was again absent. It is clarified that likeability is an asset like Meg's brilliance with numbers and Charles Wallace's genius at all but adaptability. I found it remiss not to discuss the complicated rescue of the Father since the series début but enjoyed the novel. There is less wonderment but it is less bogged with alien places and concepts. There is one mission, organized into a trio of puzzles.The survival of clairvoyant Charles Wallace, age 6, is crucial to our universe and parallels problems their parents are scientifically aware of. Meg, age 14 and her best friend, Calvin, age 16 need to be the heroes in concert with an alien, one of our biological organisms too small to see, and a loathed school principal! Forging an understanding, never mind including a school figure in the first place, are what make this story exemplary.... next to Margaret's compassion, humour, and astonishingly vast imagination!*Please note the timeline seems to adopt this novel's: 1973. However the family only advances one year since the 1962 release. The moon landing is discussed as a long ago event, which could only be fresh in 1962."

It speaks deeply of love, establishes the world, and raises many questions for future books. I'm beginning to accept that L'Engle does abrupt endings, and I wish there was just one more chapter of denouement in this one. Or maybe that's just me preferring the homey bits of stories more than the adventures. Anyway, there is a theme in this book that I have been facing in several other books lately and in real life, and it was a wholesome challenge to encounter it here. Dear Mr. Jenkins. "

Lots of exposition, lots of 'shall I - shan't I?' moments. Charles and his creepy-cool ESP is a setting rather than a character, and Meg whimpers around like a wet blanket, whinging about how difficult everything is and how Charles is The Most Important Being in the Universe and everything is fine as long as we self-sacrifice for him. We get a little more depth to the character of Mr Jenkins, but we still don't learn his first name.The way that the Teacher and the other student show up seems so arbitrary. I intensely dislike the ""God's Plan"" aspect of narrative events like this. It's free rein for characters to have PHENOMENAL COSMIC POWERS, but the kids have to solve all of the problems. Why? Because, you know, God's awesome and stuff. Eh.And the thing that really broke this for me? I love that these books contain 'almost-science', giving you lots of cool science-y concepts like time travel, life on other planets, multiple dimensions etc. But there is a basic factual error about two minutes in which totally ruined it - a character says it takes 200 billion years for the Milky Way to rotate, 'counter-clockwise'. ARGH. a) They're out by three orders of magnitude, and this is a character that really cares about this sort of thing! b) 'counter-clockwise'?! With respect to WHAT?! For all of the 'scale is nothing' crap that the characters spout later, you'd think that there would be a snappy come-back to these assertions. But no, just a sage nod from the Teacher.Once I'd realised this sort of basic fact-checking was absent, I couldn't help but get annoyed by the increasingly-inaccurate cell biology and the basic misunderstanding of chaos theory and complexity which drives the book. Seriously, we lose mitochondria all the time. It's ok. If everything is tied together, and the death of child could mean the death of the Universe, shouldn't we be frantic about the number of gut bacteria we lose every second? The number of skin cells? Oh wait, I guess 'number isn't important' - got to remember such Delphic pronouncements. What's MUCH cooler is that mitochondria have their own DNA; now THAT would have been an interesting direction to take it. A mitochondrial revolution!

Meg and Charles Wallace are rejoicing at having their family whole again. Their father is back, although still working for the government, and life just seems better. The only shadow on the family is the bullying that plagues Charles Wallace at school, as the stiff principal of the elementary believes in ""toughening"" the kids up. But then things begin to turn for the strange again. Charles Wallace claims to have seen dragons in the house garden. But Meg, who usually believes her little brother infallibly, is skeptical. Because Charles Wallace is getting sick; he is fatigued, feverish, and pale. And when Meg's mother diagnoses Charles with a rare new disease called mitochondritis, everything is going to be turned inside out...literally.Once again Meg will have to step into the realm of the utterly fantastic, because help soon arrives for her brother's sickness. A strange intergalactic Teacher named Blajeny, a cherubim made of eyes, fire, and spiritual energy who is actually the ""dragons"" Charles Wallace saw. Calvin O'Keefe, the handsome and open-minded high schooler who will stop at nothing to help and protect Meg and her family. Together with some unexpected new allies, they will have to undertake another fantastic journey; not to the far reaches of space, but into the very cells of Charles Wallace's body to battle his disease at its heart. I adored this book; in some ways I loved it more than ""A Wrinkle in Time."" The characters get more fleshed out, the relationships between Meg and the others are brilliant, and the metaphysical concepts introduced about life, mind, and spirit are beautiful and wonderful, especially kything. A book I read again and again to get new things out of it each time."

There are several differences in this book that kept me from liking it as much.The book is very repetitious, going over and over and over concepts that are described in detail the first time. The heroine, Meg complains and whines a bit too much. It feels like the book lags in places just to lengthen the story. What could be said in a page or two is said in a whole chapter. I listened to the audioversion of this book and L'Engle herself is the narrator. I generally like to listen to author's readings of their books, and she generally does a decent job. She doesn't use voices for her characters except when her voice became a Dan Ackroyd version of Julie Child. To say the least, this did not work for me or the character and was quite distracting.I loved reading about the original characters from A Wrinkle in Time. L'Engle is very creative when it come to developing new and old characters. These books do seems to hold up to the test of time and are not as dated as I would expect.I will eventually work my way through the series to see how Meg and her family come through it all."

They are full of love, and hope, and I find that even if I have not read them recently--until today I hadn't touched A Wind in the Door since middle school, perhaps, so at the very least 12 years or so--they still make me more aware of what a joy and gift it is to be alive, to be living.

I remember dreaming that my current crush in middle school and I discovered we could kythe with only each other. And that it drew us much closer and made him love me. Sigh.

I think my first criticism of the book is that I didn't feel it was a sequel. I felt Wrinkle was one story and this one a different story, not a continuation of the story. Not being a sci-fi genre lover in the first place, the book was hard to follow at times. What helped me get through it was pausing to see the underlying tones of religion that L'Engle wrote into the series. The fight between good and evil, the lesson that love is not just a feeling, it's an action we can all do. Maybe as I continue the series, this particular book will make more sense to me. I surprisingly adored A Wrinkle in Time, and was hoping for the same reaction with this book. ""Echthroi! You are Named! My arms surround you. You are no longer nothing. You are. You are filled. You are me.""I do want to give Madeleine L'Engle praise for writing this book in a manner that can teach kids principles of Christianity without feeling like you've been whacked over the head with a Bible. Also for attacking an issue that is so very prevalent in today's society - bullying, in 1973! She creates amazing characters and can tell amazing stories (even amazing stories can be hard to follow at times...)"

Which kind of disappointed me. I really wanted to like it and I guess I sort of set up some high and unrealistic expectations for this book.Okay, so Charles is sick for basically the entire book. So he doesn't get to go on any adventure, at all, and that made me really sad. I love Charles and I was just disappointed with his character in this book. The there's Calvin and Meg, who I love so much because they are so freaking adorable, who get to go on these adventures and shit. I'm jealous because they get to time travel.. meanwhile I get to sit in traffic for an hour+ everyday on my way to and from work.Besides liking the usual characters, I actually really liked Charles and Meg's mom in this book. I don't know if I mentioned her in the previous book but hey, she stepped up her game in this one. She just overall cared for her kids. She was always home, no matter what, and she still was doing her actual job job too. Women is a superhero in my eyes.Overall, I liked the book. I still don't like science.

I enjoy the interactions between Meg and Chales Wallace, and also Meg and Calvin and will be interested to see how their relationships develop as the series continues.I listened to this as an audiobook and found it a little difficult to wrap my mind around the fact that it was narrated by Jennifer Ehle - and from the beginning I couldn’t help but picture her as Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice sitting down to narrate a book, however she has an American accent, which I found very hard to reconcile with her P&P performance!!

They meet a few new mysterious creature not unlike the Mrs but just not as good. And though the other family members are mentioned more they still do not get included on the adventure. There are very few secondary characters and they do not have much impact on the story. The storyline is bizarre and to me not all that interesting either, I was very much disappointed by this story when compared to the first book in the series.

Bullying has only really become a hot button topic in the last couple years.The answer to bullying, ""love your bully, and learn to deal with it."" And this is where this book fails to live up to the first book. Instead of a story based on science, this book relies too much on the quasi-religious belief in the interconnectedness of everything in the universe.

63,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1307950-anna,Rating 5 out of 5,"The second in L'Engle's trilogy of A Wrinkle In Time. Upon re-reading this book I find it pretty amazing that traveling through space and time can put the crew onto another planet in another galaxy; can put them onto a planet that is completely hypothetical and based on nice visual thoughts and compounded into another space; can put them INSIDE of Charles Wallace's mitochondrion, Yadah (yeah, it's named), where the farondolae (little ultra-microscopic organisms inside the mitochondria) are getting out of control and destroying their 'world'. This microcosmic world they delve into with being in a PART of a cell in the human body, acts as a metaphor for how small humans/Earth is compared to the entirety of the universe. To the farondolae, Charles Wallace is their universe, and his heart beats every 10 years in their time. They have trouble believing there is anything outside of their universe (i.e. other universes/humans with their own ""galaxies"" of mitochondria and cells, etc.). Anyway, this may not make sense if you haven't read it, but the fact that L'Engle can get micro and biological and super theoretical scientific to inadvertently (or probably on purpose, actually) describe the existence of humanity and Earth and the universe, is, well -- MIND BLOWING! And I read this in 5th grade and picked up on NONE of this, but just enjoyed the imaginative adventure I was taken on. Wow. I. Love. Books. "
64,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1444169-bill,Rating 5 out of 5,"A significant book for me growing up, and still a powerful read now that I'm a grown-up. L'Engle does an amazing job, here and in the rest of this series, describing how human actions have significance beyond our comprehension. Even in a world of cosmic forces, celestial beings, and alternate realities, everything that humans do truly matters. Even something as simple as choosing to dislike another person (as Meg does with her brother's principal, Mr. Jenkins) can have far-reaching consequences -- and choosing to let go of that hate can be a breakthrough.""A Swiftly Tilting Planet"" addresses this theme more directly, but I love so many aspects of this book: the unique and imperfect characters, the conflicts and choices they face, the weird play on scale (connecting stars and galaxies with mitochondria and human bodies) and the de-emphasis on the concepts of distance, space, and even movement.In true Socratic fashion, the book raises questions for the reader but doesn't necessarily answer them. It's fitting, since teaching (and ""Teaching"", capital ""T"") is another core theme in the book. This is definitely a book I will find myself re-reading from time to time throughout my life to keep myself questioning."

Sin embargo, le bajé una estrella en comparación al primero porque la mitad del libro hacia el final me aburrió debido a tanta información: un adulto que no sabía como comportarse, explicaciones espaciales, física cuántica cuasi no llevada a la práctica y una resolución tan repentina que tuve que releerlo varias veces ya que las descripciones espaciales (fundamentales en esta historia) eran muy vagas.

66,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1849033-kiri,Rating 2 out of 5,"As with A Wrinkle in Time, the characterization in this book is a bit thin, and most particularly so for the main character, Meg. How old is she? 14 or so? She sure doesn't come across that way (she feels MUCH YOUNGER), among other things (anger, tantrums, sobbing fearful tears) in apparently being completely devoid of any typical teenage angst/hormones/feelings with regard to her ""closeness"" with 16-year-old Calvin. That aside, the theme here is (again) love... but it's gotten even weirder and more mystical than in the first book, devolving ultimately into incoherent poetry about the oneness of everything. I can appreciate a nicely wielded gilding of poetry in an otherwise prose composition, but this just feels tedious. Maybe I'm just too old for these books (a sad thought given my fond memories!) or maybe they really are as threadbare and clunky as they now seem. Disappointing!"

I picked this up right after the first and was disappointed. The sense of urgency that developed and drove the original book is totally gone. There's no mention of what's going on with The Black Thing, Meg's father, the trio of witches, IT, tesseracting, or all those planets in danger of total annihilation. It focuses more on a new adventure with new adversaries that represent the same idea, but on a 'micro' level instead of 'macro.' It was kind of a drag to get through, dry and not as exciting or meaningful (in my opinion) as the first. The characterization in this one was lacking, too. "

It was like the same characters but an utterly separate story. That was just bizarre. Secondly, there was no plot... The whole thing was just complicated, philosophical bits of dialogue after the next. The first half wasn't so bad, I rather enjoyed it. But literally the ENTIRE second half was one loooong, weird conversation. An interesting conversation, but still. Can we have some action please?BUT.

Potom sú tu knihy, na ktoré sa ihneď zabudne. No a potom sú tú tie iné knihy, o ktorých sa síce hovorí len občas a nikdy nie dostatočne, no napriek tomu majú čo ponúknuť čitateľovi bez ohľadu na dobu, v ktorej knihu číta a bez ohľadu na jeho vek. Vietor vo dverách je jednou z takých kníh. Na prvý pohľad pôsobia naozaj nenápadné, snáď jednoducho. Ale to len do momentu, kým ju neotvoríte a nezistíte, že vo vnútri sa ukrýva niekoľko samostatných galaxií.Dej tejto knihy nenadväzuje príliš plynulo na udalosti predchádzajúce knihy Struny času. V skutočnosti medzi týmito dvomi príbehmi ubehlo najskôr niekoľko rokov, hoci je náročné presne to určiť. Samotná autorka sa tým však nezaoberala, pretože pre ňu bolo oveľa dôležitejšie napísať príbeh a nie určovať, kedy presne sa odohráva. Každopádne postavy stihli o niečo vyrásť, aj keď sa to niekedy prejavuje inak, než by malo.Meg je stále to obyčajné dievča s neobyčajným pohľadom na svet, ktoré sa stále dostáva do problémov. Calvin je stále jej priateľ a v jeho prítomnosti všetko vyzerá byť akési jednoduchšie, snáď znesiteľnejšie. No a Charles Walace je ešte stále tým malým géniom, ktorý však nastúpil do školy. A pretože je iný než jeho rovesníci, treba ho za to potrestať a čo je lepšie než šikana a násilie.Už len v tomto základe sa ukrýva nadčasovosť knihy, veď aj teraz sú všetci čo i len trochu odlišní ľudia vyčleňovaní z kolektívov – a to aj napriek tomu, aká údajne nesmierne vyspelá má byť tá naša spoločnosť. Ale nebola by to kniha Madeleine L’Engle, keby bol príbeh takýto jednoduchý. Pretože týmto to len začína. Okrem šikany sa k tomu všetkému pridávajú aj zdravotné problémy Charlesa Walacea. A hoci to nevyzerá ako ideálny štart nového dobrodružstva, predsa sa ním tieto maličkosti stanú.Dej samotný je opäť mnohovrstevný a popretkávaný naozaj divokou autorkinou fantáziou. Obyčajné a jednoduché myšlienky mi podsúva zabalené v naozaj nevšedných kabátikoch a jednotlivé lekcie mi neponúka na striebornom podnose, ale núti ma naučiť sa ich. Podobne ako postavy. Oproti predchádzajúcej knihe však tento príbeh pôsobí o čosi menej konzistentne – aspoň spočiatku. Niektoré časti akoby nezapadali do celkového diania. (Hoci neskôr sa ukáže, že ide presne o pravý opak.)V niekedy až detsky pôsobiacich dobrodružstvách sa ukrývajú nádherne hlboké myšlienky o sile priateľstva, o odvahe, prekonávaní strachu, o porozumení, o osobnom raste a v neposlednom rade aj o tom, že aj na prvý pohľad nedôležité maličkosti môžu ovplyvňovať obrovský celok. Každý detail v tejto knihe navzájom súvisí s tým nasledujúcim a to je vlastne posolstvom tejto knihy – že my všetci, bez ohľadu na to, akí sme malí a bezvýznamní, ovplyvňujeme to, ako vyzerá naše spoločenstvo.Ovplyvňujeme jeho smerovania, liečime jeho nedostatky a niekedy, dôsledkom vlastnej nevedomosti alebo arogancie, ho ničíme bez toho, aby sme si to vôbec uvedomovali. A to je len malá časť z toho, čomu sa táto útla knižočka venovala. Hoci sa na prvý pohľad môže zdať, že je príliš útla na to, aby sa mohla venovať dôležitým a pálčivým témam, nie je to pravda. V skutočnosti sa autorka nebála v deji pomenovať hneď niekoľko dôležitých problémov a ich riešenie mi predkladá niekedy naozaj nevšedným spôsobom. Využila svoju nesmierne jedinečnú fantáziu na to, by mi ukázala, že niekedy aj ten najväčší problém má v skutočnosti veľmi jednoduché riešenie. Stačí, ak na jeho riešenie nebudeme sami. A ktovie, možno nás vďaka tomu svojou pomocnou rukou prekvapia ľudia, od ktorých by sme to nečakali. Rovnako, ako sa to stalo postavám.Vietor vo dverách je pokračovaním Strún času, ktoré sa odohráva v presne neurčenom čase. Zo samotného deja vyplýva, že snáď ubehlo niekoľko rokov od udalostí predchádzajúcej knihy. Opäť sa mi predstavili tie isté postavy, hoci medzitým stihli vyrásť a trošku sa zmeniť, no stále sa majú čo učiť. Tam, kde v prechádzajúcom dobrodružstve zachraňovali svojho dlho strateného otca, teraz ich čaká o čosi náročnejšia úloha – majú zachrániť Charlesa Walacea, ktorého postihla neznáma choroba.Madeleine L’Engle mi s využitím svojej jedinečnej fantázie predostrela zaujímavo vystavaný mnohovrstvový a nesmierne citlivý príbeh, v ktorom pomenovala ďalšie pálčivé spoločenské problémy, ktoré nás strašia aj dnes. V čom čiastočne tkvie nadčasovosť tohto diela. Takisto mi ponúkla mnohé zamyslenia a témy, o ktorých som niekedy ani len neverila, že by sa mohli zmestiť do takejto útlej knihy.Vďaka dynamickému deju som takisto nemala možnosť sa nudiť. V konečnom dôsledku som si z knihy odniesla oveľa viac, než som očakávala. Hoci v prípade tejto knihy bolo ešte o čosi náročnejšie odkryť jednotlivé vrstvy a témy. Vďaka tomu sa, rovnako ako Struny času, radí medzi tie jedinečné príbehy, ktoré mi pri každom novom čítaní predstavia nejaké doteraz nepovšimnuté myšlienkové zákutie. recenzia: https://lili-darknight.blogspot.com/2..."

Though, I feel like I had a few problems with this book - mostly, it not living up to the first.Firstly, the good parts - I still adore these characters and how AMAZINGLY creative L'Engle is! She really knows how to tell a story. And just like the first of this series, this was incredibly charming and again felt like I was a child again reading a story like the hobbit or narnia. Also this story lowkey cracked me up cause it was sort of a sciency/creepy Magic School Bus???Also I could legit relate to this story - the realistic parts at least lol - SO MUCH. In this book Charles Wallace goes to school for the first time, and there he is reprimanded for being smart, he gets beat up by the bigger kids and is bullied, teacher do nothing to help, and even put him down for being smart and getting him in trouble. I don't wanna say I was THAT kid but I kinda was. I've spoken about it a few times on my channel but I was a VERY early reader - because of my parents I was able to read around the age of two/three before I even went to preschool. So, after preschool, where I had an incredibly supportive, nurturing teacher who got me every book she could get her hands on for me, I went to an elementary school that had a ""everyone needs to be at the same pace"" learning environment - which meant slowing down any kid who was like me and excelled. I got in SO MUCH TROUBLE, I was basically in the principal's office EVERY DAY because I would finish my work quickly, I wasn't allowed to read, and would annoy the teachers and distract the other kids from their work. I got put down SO MUCH by my teachers who told me I should stop showing off, even though I was simply reading at a faster pace than my peers. I was a total little shit to them and my principal (mostly cause my parents told me to just ignore all of them lolllll) but seriously, reading about Charles Wallace in this book brought on such a surge of RAGE because DUDE I KNOW HOW IT FEELS.I love when books are able to bring on THAT type of emotion, ya know? that's WHY I read.Next, the parts that bothered me a bit. None of them are anything major but they definitely did hinder my enjoyment.- Why didn't the plot from book 1 carry over????????? I legit picked this book up so fast cause I wanted to know what was going to happen next???- on that same note, the kids all ignored the fact that anything from book 1 even happened???- This book DEFINITELY suffered from the classic kids book/middle grade book thing of having wayyyyyyyyyyy too many characters- It simply wasn't as magical/sci-fiy as the first which was a let down to me personally- just not as good as the first book :(other than those things though, I really did enjoy this book! I'm not sure if/when I'll go onto the next novels since they aren't direct sequels, but we'll see!"
76,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4063913-beth,Rating 3 out of 5,"I never liked this much as a kid and I don’t enjoy it now, either, except for the parts with Calvin. Love those. I don’t remember thinking of this as a bridge book, either, but this reread I found myself thinking of it as such: it’s got the love of A Wrinkle in Time and the Echthroi and kything of A Swiftly Tilting Planet - but somehow it has the incoherent aspects of those elements. Andree called this abstract, and I think that’s a great description. It’s so theoretical and yet its theory has immediate practical ramifications in a way that I found to be poorly explained. This is also in-between with regard to Meg: she’s not the sullen difficult relatable child she was in A Wrinkle in Time and she’s not the more confident adult of A Swiftly Tilting Planet. She’s somewhere in between, and she vacillates, and somehow it doesn’t feel like the process of growing up. I think it could feel like that, but instead L’Engle uses that vacillation to create the conflict, and it just doesn’t work for me. This is no “Meg, I give you your flaws.” It’s so much less decisive - sure of itself - convinced it can also tell a character story.There’s Calvin, though, and Calvin is great. The best part of this book isn’t Meg or Charles Wallace or Mrs. Murray’s groundbreaking scientific research or three doodled Greek letters: it’s Calvin’s story about Mr. Jenkins and the sneakers. I reread this book just for that."
77,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21496159-jessica-mae,Rating 4 out of 5,"I am just amazed by Madeline L'Engle's ability to write a sci-fi novel with religious undertones. She talks so much about science and balances it nicely with the relationships between characters. (Also, props to her for writing about women in STEM fields before it was ""cool."") There are many parts of this book that could be an allegory for principles I learned in Sunday School growing up. In particular, I loved the theme about how knowing who you are gives you strength and power, and there are forces out there trying to get you to forget that. I don't know how they'd ever adapt this into a film, and I honestly hope they never do. Many of the concepts - like ""kything"" or being inside a mitochondria - would be downright bizarre to see on screen. Like a live-action episode of The Magic School Bus. There are concepts you just wouldn't be able to portray, and it's better to just imagine them. When I read this book as a kid, a lot of it was over my head because I'd never even heard of a mitochondria. I'm glad I decided to give it another chance, because it made a lot more sense. It's still ""out there"" and probably not for everyone, but I enjoyed it. My one complaint is that much of Meg and Calvin's relationship happens ""offscreen."" I think they're adorable and I love how easily they connect; I just wanted to see more of it."
78,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47448891-e-b-dawson,Rating 3 out of 5,"Difficult book to review. L'Engle has a knack for turning the world as we know it inside out and making me look at life in a completely different way. I liked how this book took place almost completely on Earth. Instead of getting swept away from her everyday problems into a greater universal battle, Meg has to face those problems and realize how very important her actions are. I loved the concept of being Named and the importance of Naming other people. I loved Mr. Jenkins' role in the story and how Meg had to learn to see him through different eyes. I LOVED the concept of Deepening and how when even the tiniest microscopic beings in the universe refuse to fulfill their roles, the universe suffers. The imagery of a star being born and of creation's song was stunning. But I did struggle a bit wrapping my head around some of the concepts L'Engle introduced. (The idea of Xing and being Xed was a bit confusing at times, especially when Progo talked about Xing himself and it almost sounded like suicide.)Very thought-provoking with some beautiful concepts."

I'm also always a sucker for Names being a theme, and Meg's role as Namer thus spoke deeply to me, and all of those bits were beautiful.And I love how L'Engle fits scripture in, but doesn't make it obvious, so it's only visible if one knows scripture from a lifetime of reading/hearing it. And especially how this makes it clear that God is very much present in her Kairos-world.Kything is so cool. :)I love the extra subtle sweetness between Calvin and Meg, which I only noticed this time around. Oh, and Proginoskes. I <3 Proginoskes. 5 stars!"

It doesn't overstay its welcome, ends on a very high and emotional note, and left me eager to continue on with the series and discover what other ways Madeleine L'Engle might mess with my head."

There are some mind blowing ideas in here though about man’s ability to comprehend the micro cosmos and macro cosmos, what reality means versus what we can comprehend, religious battles, and how viewing those different than us can only hurt us when it counts. I know A Wrinkle in Time movie just came out, but I would see #2 being much more difficult to translate visually. Is Hollywood is for it?"

To try to help her brother out, Meg visits her formal school's principal Mr Jenkins, not realising how much she will need her former principal to help assist in the next adventure.Book Review: A Wind in the Door By Madeleine L'Engle | Time Quintet #2My rating: 5 stars | Pages: 224What made me pick it up: Read a Wrinkle in Time last year for book club and wanted to continue on with the series. Format: Hardcover | Source: Library2018 challenge/s: Goodreads 2018 Reading ChallengeTRIGGER WARNING FOR BULLYING. PLEASE CONSIDER AS TO WHETHER THIS IS THE RIGHT BOOK FOR YOU.One of my favourite parts of A Wrinkle in Time was the close sibling relationship between Meg and her youngest brother, Charles Wallace. My favourite part in the second book of the series, A Wind in the Door, is again, that relationship and how Meg is prepared to travel the lengths of a universe, a galaxy as big as space or even as big as a human body to save her brother. THERE ARE DRAGONS IN THE TWINS’ VEGETABLE GARDEN— CHARLES WALLACE, A WIND IN THE DOOR, BY MADELEINE L'ENGLEThe opening line above is the very first thing you open up to and the story continues in its marvels from there. Of course, it doesn't end up being dragons at all but Progo or Proginoskes, a cherubim who along with Meg and Charles Wallace, is a student under the guidance of Blajeny. Their mission is to help stop the Echthroi, the enemy, this evil force that is X'ing things out of existence, like stars.Meg and Charles Wallace are given lessons in what the Echthroi are doing to the universe and then it gets personal when it is discovered that the Echthroi are in Charles Wallace body, destroying his farandolae (a made up organelle of the mitochondria). Sound complicated? Well, it is but when you read it, it all makes perfect sense. I love Madeleine L'Engle's imagination and how she doesn't talk down to her audience. She uses a metaphor that the human body is a galaxy to what lives inside it and makes it work. The idea that the enemy, the Echthroi are eliminating thing and turning living things into nothing is terrifying to kids but as an adult I picked up on the metaphor that the Echthroi could even be symbolic to our negative thoughts, or even go as far to say it could be linked to mental illness, the idea of X'ing, of disappearing, of blackness. What is the magic power to be used against Echthroi? Love. Of course. Love can literally lead to the creation of humans but it love can also help support someone when they are under threat of the Echthroi, slipping into the darkness, or 'X-ing'. In order to save the day, Meg has to find love, in a strictly platonic sense, to her old principal Mr Jenkins. This is hard for her to do as he did not always treat or her brother very nicely. Meg learns to accept him for what he is and realises he was only doing the best that he can do. There comes a time in every kid's life when they realise that their parents aren't perfect, that they too can make mistakes, and some kids end up resenting that their parents don't fit the hero mould anymore. Was that the message? Don't hate your parents or teachers, they are only doing what they can and you should love them because of that. Overall, while I was very disappointed that there were not dragons in the vegetable patch, it turned out to be a pretty awesome adventure that made me think a lot deeper and a lot harder than even some adult fiction books I have read. I would have thoroughly enjoyed this series as a kid or teenager and I can't recommend it strongly enough to anyone (kid, teenager or adult), who loves a good story, where science and magic coexist and love does save the day. See the review at Bindro's BookshelfI read A Wind in the Door during the 24in48 readathon and it was a great pick, short but captures your attention. You do not have to have read A Wrinkle in Time, you can read it as a standalone, but why would you miss out on this magical series?Have you read A Wind in the Door? Do you have any other recommendations with a similar theme to the Time Quintet? I would love to know your thoughts and recommendations in the comments below.5 stars."
92,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4269099-angela-blount,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 StarsI’m rounding up the rating on this, because I sincerely think this book is better than the first one. (I suspect the 11-year release gap between book 1 and 2 may have positively contributed.) The writing, the cohesion, the clarity, the emotional conveyance... everything is taken up a notable notch. Not to mention, the focal idea of the vast and infinite being both macro and micro is the best kind of brain hurt this reader could hope for.This second book in the series stands alone quite completely. So much so, there’s almost no sense for (or reference to) the cross-universe rescue adventure that composed the previous book—though this was largely the same cast of characters and took place just a year after. The closest we get is Meg's hinting that the reason Calvin is so close to her and her brother has something to do with what they've been through together. But while I found that a little strange, it didn’t distract from the overall narrative. Helpful Vocab Words: Yadah: the third person singular form of the Hebrew verbal root ydh, which depending on its conjugation carries a range of meanings involving throwing or praising.Kything: derived from the Old English kythe, cýðe; a word known from both The Vespasian Psalter (c.825) and the West Saxon Gospels (c.1025). [1] Meaning ""to announce, proclaim, declare, tell, to make known in words, to manifest, to make visible"", it survived as the Scottish dialect word kythe.Echthroi (Ἐχθροί): is a Greek plural meaning ""The Enemy"" (literally ""enemies""). The singular form of the word, Echthros (Ἐχθρός), is used in many versions and translations of the Bible for ""enemy"".While I enjoyed the Fantastic Voyage flavored premise with its philosophical and moral emphasis, it did bother me a bit that L’ Engle didn’t get the science quite right. (i.e. mitochondria don't produce oxygen. They USE oxygen, though, to generate ATP--which the cell then uses as a source of chemical energy. Mitochondria are essential to our utilization of oxygen as an energy source.) One can look at this as a simple reminder that these books are sci-fi FANTASY. But In doing a bit of research, it seems that L’Engle was likely inspired by the endosymbiotic theory of mitochondrial origins, which had been proposed by Lynn Margulis just six years prior to this book’s publication. She may have confused mitochondria with chloroplasts (found only in plants, which DO do produce oxygen as a byproduct of the conversion of carbon dioxide and water during photosynthesis.) But this particular misunderstanding doesn’t seem to have hampered the passion for science these books have inspired in many over the years. I have to applaud it for the wonderfully healthy sibling relationships that are depicted, and the overall functionality of the Murry family. I may have hesitated a bit over the biology, but the relational aspects were seamlessly portrayed."

Si en Una arruga en el tiempo el viaje a través del espacio y el tiempo desarrolla una visión macrocósmica de nuestra relación con nosotros mismos y el cosmos, en Una grieta en el espacio, el concepto es totalmente microcósmico, pues la aventura se desarrollará en el interior de una mitocondria de uno de nuestros protagonistas. Hay algunas escenas maravillosas, llenas de lirismo y corazón, pero también es científica y muy moderna (minispoiler: atención a la invención del Sr. Smith de Matrix).Bajo mi punto de pista, el rescate de estos libros en lengua española está a la altura en importancia de “Las Crónicas de Narnia” de C.S. Lewis. Ojalá los lectores de todas las edades sepan apreciarlo."
94,no user info,Rating 2 out of 5,"This two-star rating is a combination of three stars from my nine-year-old daughter and one star from me. She found it reasonably exciting and was captivated by the (dodgy) science and the concepts of mitochondria, multiple copies of Mr Jenkins and entire universes within a single person. I thought it was tedious and pretentious, a self-indulgent mixture of religious preachiness and poorly developed philosophy. There seems to be little connection with the previous book: characters barely acknowledge that they all went on an interstellar adventure together and seem abnormally sceptical about dragons and other supernatural/extra-terrestrial occurrences, given that they had been hanging out with aliens a few months previously. I also took issue with some specific ideologies of the book. Intellect and extremely high IQs are idolised and people of normal intelligence ridiculed. Anyone else feel sorry for Calvin’s poor mother, with her grey hair, missing teeth and huge brood of children? She’s depicted as disgusting and contemptible, particularly in comparison with the glamorous Mrs Murry (who airily tells her beaten-up six year old that he needs to adapt and toughen up). That’s another plot point which bothered me. A small child is being bullied at school to the point of being physically beaten up and neither the school nor his parents seem to think this is a serious issue for the school to deal with. Yes, I will probably read the next book in the series just to see if things improve and if Charles Wallace is any less irritating as a teenager. "
95,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6535930-pamela-shropshire,Rating 5 out of 5,"Like A Wrinkle in Time, A Wind in the Door is about the never-ending battle between good and evil, or as the book puts it, between Something and Nothing, between between being a Named one or being Xed. In the first book, Meg had to rescue her father and Charles Wallace from a malevolent, autocratic brain called IT on a distant planet; now she must help save the life of Charles Wallace who has become ill because his mitochondria are ""sick"" by becoming microscopic in size and going inside him.Underneath the admittedly fascinating science and science fiction and fantasy, this book is about human relationships and the self, about self-discovery and belonging, about love and sacrifice. It is every bit as wonderful - and maybe even more so - as the first book in the series.One of the important concepts that I picked up on in this reread is that Meg is always looking for someone to swoop in and save the day. In book 1, she thought if they could just find their father, all their troubles would be over, that he would fix everything immediately. In this book, she wants either Blajeny, a Teacher, or Proginoskes, the cherubim, to miraculously stop the other kids from bullying Charles Wallace. In both books, Meg must learn that the answers are not so easy or so cut-and-dried.I find that many Christians are like this, expecting God to step in and fix their life's problems as though he were magician waving a magic wand, rather than doing the hard work necessary to fix problems of their own making. Again, I highly recommend this book to all ages."
96,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7206839-jenny,Rating 5 out of 5,"I reread this book with my dad. He really liked it, and I loved it just as much as I did the first time. L'Engle's themes are, as usual, universal love, the connectivity of all living things, the importance of every single creature, from largest star within largest galaxy within largest solar system to smallest farandolae within smallest mitochondria within smallest cell within smallest human being. L'Engle's fantasy mixed with science fiction mixed with magical realism is the perfect blend to convey her themes. The main human characters, Meg, Charles Wallace, Calvin, and Mr. Jenkins are no more real than cherubim Proginoskes and farandola Sporos. Every character matters, conveying L'Engle's overarching theme even further. The story is interesting and beautiful with moments of poetry and beautiful descriptions such as the one of Meg and Calvin's deepest kything.I love this book. I love L'Engle, and I love her themes. Love matters. Matter matters. Everything that was created matters. If you hate something, if you hate someone, you make it less important than you, and the whole balance of creation is thrown off. Love doesn't take; it only gives. That's the most beautiful idea I can think of."

It is not easy but it is bearable, we have been given as much as we can carry. And to have Madeleine L'Engle write in Walking on Water: Reflections on Faith and Art that ""reading about the response of people in stories, plays, poems, helps us to respond more courageously and openly at our own moments of turning"" gives me fresh fortitude for whatever God sends my way. Lord have mercy.♥️♥️♥️What an exquisite book and I seem to like it every little bit as I did Wrinkle. The author's acute ability to blend science, faith, the natural and the human, the spiritual and the everyday, the wonderful and the beautiful is a trait which she develops masterfully in this second book of the series."

While the first will always be one of my favorite stories, I think I've gained an appreciation for this follow-up, and a desire to read through the rest of the quintet. If anything Wind in the Door suffers from expectation of similarity to its predecessor. And it does continue similar things but often in an even more ethereal way. There's a great deal of poignancy here and relevance to our modern world. I'd love to see what L'Engle would think about deepening and Ecthroi in the current political climate...."

108,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5395467-n-t-embeast,Rating 1 out of 5,"A Wind in the Door by Madeleine L'Engle, also known as: Child Abuse the Enabler, Rehashing the Same Old Story with No Character Growth to Speak Of, and Halfway Decent Concepts Executed Far More Poorly than Most People Are Willing to Admit.Before we get into the issues I have with this book, some good thoughts: I can still see the concepts that influenced me so much as a child in this book. Kything is the key one, because it gave a name to something that I, as a child and even now as an adult, do regularly. I speak to things and emote with them, commune with them, because I love to connect to others--inanimate, nature, human, animal. It's something that's always been a part of me, since I was very young. ""Kythe"" is a word that names that type of communication, that sharing of beings and emotions and experiences with another thing. It's probably my favorite concept in this book because it's one that hits so close to home for me. It could have been used more skillfully but that would have required skill on the author's part, and I'm going to bring that point up next.I'm still undecided on whether L'Engle has brief moments of beauty and wonder in her writing because she gets lucky or because she works really hard on conveying certain parts of her stories over others. Because her writing is dumbed down for all audiences. Children, adults, anyone reading this will be hard pressed not to find it tiring at a certain point. Things are repeated, needlessly, because the book is not long and the concepts not difficult to grasp--for children or adults or otherwise. And yet she has a habit of over-explaining things that have been talked about previously, at length, several times before. It makes me feel like she's not proofreading her own work because she forgot she already mentioned something a couple of chapters or pages before. My humble recommendation is that she needed a thorough class in how to write persuasive arguments as well, because by the end of me hearing the same sentence for the twelfth or twentieth time out of five different people's mouths, I'm just writing off her ability to pull anyone over to her side, regardless if that side is good or bad.It's a shame, really, because occasionally she has what she had in the first book: brief, shining moments of ingenuity and creativity that authentically pull you in and make you want to wrap your mind around the concepts she's presenting you. The scientific ideas she has are marvelous for exploring, and some of the descriptions are absolutely beautiful. But she ends up over-elaborating the same points without exploring them further into their countless possibilities. It's like she has an idea, but she never really got far in thinking it through to what it could be beyond the initial concept, which just leaves you wanting more, and not in a good way. In addition to that, the concepts that she does portray and try to elaborate on, she tends to limit by forcing them into the ""Send This Message to the Reader"" structure, trying to convey something's importance without letting the reader discover for themselves the importance of the concept she's trying to portray.For example, if you really wanted to convey this message of ""the entire universe is connected, from the smallest creatures that live inside of creatures that live inside of us, to the greatest stars and their galaxies"" then you could have done it in the same way, by showing how Sporos affected Charles Wallace, which affected this galactic battle for existence versus non-existence, but without the heavy-handed ""But this character is so unlovable, how could I ever care about him?"" that we were beaten over the head with every. single. page. It. was. brought. up. relentlessly. endlessly. exhaustingly. There are better methods than repeating the same line over and over again to try to convey its importance to us. Especially when it takes you almost 60 pages to convey that single concept to an actual conclusion. Ugh. This does *not* make reading *fun* for ANYONE.And what's sad is that wasn't even me going into the problems I have with this book. Many, numerous, exacting problems that have filled my status updates. Most of those updates have addressed them, but I have to go into them here as well, because I can't not bring them up.I don't care who you are or how well beloved you are to people, L'Engle, you do NOT get to use the message of ""Everyone has a place in the grand scheme of things"" to excuse adults not doing ANYTHING about bullying and child abuse. Charles Wallace was BEATEN every single day of school. He came home with black eyes, bloody noses, bruises everywhere. And you had Meg, his older sister, his mother Mrs. Murry, his father Mr. Murry, his teacher, his principal Mr. Jenkins, Charles Wallace HIMSELF, the Teacher character of Blajeny, Proginoskes the Cherubim, almost EVERY CHARACTER in this book say that he ""had to learn to adapt"". LEARN TO ADAPT TO BEING BEATEN UP IN SCHOOL EVERY DAY?! BECAUSE HE WAS DIFFERENT? And then you give us the excuse that his test in life was to ""Learn to adapt while staying entirely himself""-- You're teaching kids that they cannot be THEMSELVES around their family, their friends, in school, or ANYWHERE because IT IS NOT SAFE FOR THEM TO BE WHO THEY REALLY ARE AROUND OTHER PEOPLE! And this is OKAY?! THIS IS CONSIDERED ACCEPTABLE? The parents and teachers and principal and the OTHERWORLDLY BEINGS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO GUIDE US tell us this is OKAY? TO BE BEATEN FOR BEING AN INDIVIDUAL?!THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE READING MATERIAL FOR ANYONE OF *ANY* AGE, LET ALONE CHILDREN!How do you EXCUSE this?! How do you ALLOW THIS BOOK to be considered a CLASSIC?! This is parents brushing off their SIX YEAR OLD BOY being BEATEN, DAILY by saying they can't DO anything about it?! TAKE HIM OUT OF SCHOOL! Demand meetings with the teachers and principal! Demand the school board get involved! Get the government involved if you have to! THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS BEHAVIOR BEING TOLERATED. AT ALL! And if you begin to tell me that Mr. Jenkins said that he would change things when he got back to being the principal of the school after this adventure, I'd like to point you to page 236:""What will you do, Mr. Jenkins? Can you make things different?"" [Meg asked]""I don't know. I cannot dictate Charles Wallace's safety. He must learn, himself, to adapt.""THIS IS FOUR PAGES FROM THE END OF THE BOOK. THERE IS NOTHING LEARNED FROM EVERYTHING WE JUST WENT THROUGH ABOUT VALUING THE SMALLEST FORM OF LIFE BECAUSE IT AFFECTS THE ENTIRE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS. And we, as the reader, are just supposed to be OKAY with this?! This is absolutely disgusting.And that doesn't even touch on the problems I have with Meg. Oh, boy. That's an entire other issue that I don't even want to bring up because of how problematic it is. Meg was the main character in A Wrinkle in Time, and yet she has grown 0% since then. She is superficial, has no independence or willpower of her own, needs a minimum of 33% of the book to be goaded, urged, yelled at, excruciatingly explained to, guided, encouraged, told, BEGGED to DO ANYTHING of substance, and then only because several people around her were spending that 33% of the book telling her to do it. And then we have another 33% of the book coming up where we rinse and repeat the same cycle for her to do anything ELSE.Which might make a great comedy, but see, the issue here is that Meg supposedly adores her baby brother, Charles Wallace. It's HIS life that is at stake here. We are told, repeatedly, by Meg and others, that Meg *loves* Charles Wallace....why then are we spending 99.9% of the book with other characters trying to motivate Meg to do ANYTHING to save his life?When you love someone, and they are in trouble, and someone tells you that there's only one way to save their life, what do you do? Think of the person that's most important in all the world to you: your partner, your sibling, your parent, your child, your friend. They are going to die. Someone tells you, ""You must save this person you don't like in order to save your loved one."" What do you do? You look the person straight in the eye and say, ""I'll do it. Anything, for the one I love."" Yes, I've simplified the concept, but that is the concept from this very book. Otherworldly guides are telling you that you must save a man you hate in order to save your baby brother. Why in all that is good are those other characters MAKING YOU DO IT when you supposedly LOVE Charles Wallace and would do ANYTHING for him, according to your own words, Meg? Hm?There is a level of unbelievability in this book that stems directly from Meg as an impossibly thick-headed, irrational character. There is no brain there. There is no thought. She does not take 1+1 and find 2, she finds excuses for why she shouldn't have to add 1+1 in the first place in order to get 2. She wants things done and doesn't want to put in any effort to do it. Which is infuriating because we, as the reader, are supposed to be convinced that she CARES ABOUT HER BROTHER'S LIFE AND WELLBEING. And yet she does everything imaginable to detract from that and take you, as the reader, outside of the immersion of the story because of her inane actions!*Exhales* Let's wrap this up.TL;DRThis was a book that had potentially good ideas that were executed terribly on a whole. The characters are like paper in the wind: occasionally they appear to have some depth to them, but at the whim of the wind, you see them for their lackluster construction and realize they're props for an unlikable and impossible main character, and meant as tools to drive home a ""Message of the Story"" that comes across more as beating a dead horse. Worst of all, the message trying to be conveyed is overshadowed by the message that children NEED to conform, or else they will be abused and eventually die if they do not, just as Charles Wallace is abused throughout school and through the negligence of his family and mentors, winds up on his deathbed, and is saved only through the conforming of his farandolae to their ""ultimate purpose"" and the rejection of the pursuit of pleasure because it brings about ""nothingness"".Don't read this book. It's monstrous and poorly written."

OK, I'm getting more and more perplexed as to how this is a children's book? First, when the book started I was really excited. Meg and the family seemed familiar and I couldn't wait to start on another adventure with these characters that now felt like friends. I love how sweet and caring all the characters are and I love how the theme of science is woven throughout the book. However, when L'Engle introduces Blajeny the Teacher you just KNOW that there is some bigger message lurking around the next page. But ok you keep reading... and then what the hell?!! Mr. Jenkins, her brother’s principle, splits into 3 people while Meg and the Proginoskes (which by the way still have no idea how to picture him. I've settled on something that looks like a Shetland pony covered in eyes and feathers) have about a 7 page philosophical discussion about knowing who you really are and evil and love. All the while, the 3 Mr. Jenkins are just running around in front of a school with kids being unloaded off the bus. Then the real Mr. Jenkins says to Meg, you have to pick me as the real Mr. Jenkins and I don't know why but I know its important. My feeling is that the situations in the book are only props for L'Engle to get across some bigger message she wants to convey. I'm just saying if 2 people came to my place of business and started impersonating me I would call the police immediately, not debate with a young girl to prove that I'm the real version of myself. And don't get me wrong, I not against L'Engle’s bigger picture...or at least I don't think I am based on what I think she is trying to say. I'm all for teaching kids morals through stories. Like in every good fairy tale there is a lesson to be learned. That's great, but it’s also wrapped and packaged in a more fluid story...something you can follow. Anyway, by the time I got through that scene I needed to take a mental health day. I think I'm letting it all get to me so much because I really like the story and I just wish she would have spent a little more time on scene development and the character interaction. Well, off to A Swiftly Tilting Planet!"
110,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10781987-hannah,Rating 5 out of 5,"I think I actually enjoyed this more than my memories of reading A Wrinkle in Time many years ago.I listened to the audiobook at 2x speed and the format of the book was very similar to Book #1, but in a familiar and comforting way. It was also a good thing that I recently watched the movie adaptation because there is no recap or ""As you know, Bob"" moments for the reader to recap what happened in A Wrinkle in Time. Everyone seems to be acting like everything is back to normal and nothing ever happened.Once again, a group of clever, insightful children are swept up with a company of whimsical, magical beings with many philosophical (and religious) overtones. This time, they are also accompanied by an adult of the most horrible sort: an uncompromising principal. I do take some issue with the childish way Mr. Jenkins is viewed (dull and lifeless), but I have added some adult headcanon that he has depression, which solves many issues for me.For the audiobook version, kudos for how much Charles Wallace's teacher and Mr. Jenkins' indifference makes my blood boil - both the words used and the voices thrown.I also especially appreciated how the dragon/cherubim mashup was a mass of wings and eyes (true to mythology) rather than a stereotypical European fantasy dragon or modern depiction of an angel.Along with His Dark Materials and The Chronicles of Narnia, I am glad this series is part of the children's literature canon as it relates to re-imagining Western philosophies. As in, it is thoughtful and inclusive and demands questioning rather than being preachy.I will continue this series with much more enthusiasm (the paperbacks have been on my shelf for years)."
111,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/98630867-monique,Rating 3 out of 5,"I feel like I enjoyed reading this book, but it was not nearly as good as A Wrinkle in Time (AWIT). I feel like A Wind in the Door functions as a pretty good children's novel, but it doesn't have the same of universal attraction that AWIT had. The plot of this book was definitely written in a style characteristic to Madeleine L'Engle, but I felt like the premise was not as compelling. The themes sort of repeated those emphasized in AWIT. Moreover, while AWIT had an original, intriguing story line. The scientific ideas mentioned, integrated with biblical allusions, all seemed to fit together well. While the narrative diverged from archetypal children's stories, everything was easy-to-follow. The suspense and the narrative arc were built up very well. However, A Wind in the Door (AWITD) fell short when it came to developing a cohesive plot. Again, L'Engle included scientific principles integrated with spiritual/religious ideas. However, the execution was a little choppy. The explanations of the newly invented scientific-spiritual hybrid ideas within the novel were muddled and confusing at times. Moreover, the premise was not as compelling. All in all, I still enjoyed reading this book mostly because I enjoyed the opportunity to revisit my favorite characters (Meg and Calvin hehe). While I do wish their relationship was developed a little more deeply, I still enjoyed watching them grow and learning more about their backstories. I felt like L'Engle could have done more to demonstratetheir closeness rather than just saying ""they kythe"" (meaning connect telepathically), so therefore they must have a close relationship. Nonetheless, it's always a joy to watch your favorite child characters learn and grow, and this book has been on my bucket list for a while, so I'm glad I finally got around to reading it. I will say, since the time gaps between this book and the sequels is so large, I don't know if I'll continue with the series. (I'll miss reading about teenage Calvin and Meg too much.) However, I feel like AWIT and AWITD make sense as a pair, so I'm glad I read them both!"
112,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51182403-trenchologist,Rating 3 out of 5,"3+Second of third from the stack of childhood books I found in the attic and decided yes, wanna reread those. Not as memorable to me as Wrinkle, and while reading I soon knew why.It's engaging, loose in structure but full of emotion and event just as Wrinkle -- and follows nearly the same course as its predecessor as well. The heart of what makes L'Engle worth reading and the journey breathless (particularly for younger readers I should think) is still there, but the mass and tissue around it isn't as coherent or strong as was Wrinkle.Meg was more annoying to me in this one. -Did you learn nothing from your first incredible journey?- Charles Wallace more an obvious device. -Do more than exist to incite action.- Too little Calvin. -He remains the anchor, that's important, but is given no wins.- I love the examination of us as our own galaxy, full of creatures that Know us as their whole universe. That this journey was within instead of to the far outer-reaches of space, and that it's equally vital and important. A singing kelp forest deep in our cells--wonderful.The home and family still warm and vivid and uniquely their own. After all that effort to rescue the father, I wanted more of him. The action was too repetitious, the trials too similar--the whole too similar to Wrinkle. It's all fine, and the very end grabs you, and while I continue to admire L'Engle's storytelling and huge|infinitesimal ideas and grasp of character, it doesn't quite soar."

Místo hledání tatíka tu tentokrát máme nemocného Charlese a cestu do hlubin lidských buněk. Jako jo, čtivé a docela zábavné, ale mým favoritem zůstává jednička. 3/5*English Review: A Wind in the door is sequel to bestselling A Wrinkle in Time, which was also adapted to movie this year. Second book from Time Quintet takes place few months after events of the first book and follows same bunch of characters we know and love. Meg and her brother must face another challenge - possible invasion from space, something which looks like dragon and unknown illness. Sounds promising, right? Well, unfortunately, second book did not impress me as much as the first one. Why? I think that the main issue I had with this book was just the whole plot and characters. I loved strange and foreign atmosphere in the first book + characters. I like heroic quests and the one Meg had to take in Wrinkle in Time was surely enjoyable. I am not big fan of biology, meaning I did not understand half the stuff Meg and her friends dealt with in A Wind in the door. It was also slow paced compared to the first book and I missed the spark I felt in A Wrinkle in a Time. I still enjoyed it, though. Meg and Calvin are my favourite couple for sure. 3/5*"
114,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9656259-c-p-cabaniss,Rating 3 out of 5,"I read A Wrinkle in Time for the first time a couple of months ago and really enjoyed it. I liked the quirky characters, the writing, and the odd story. At the time, I wasn't sure if I would continue the series, since I've heard negative things about the rest of the books. Since my library Overdrive had the audiobooks, I decided to give at least this second one a try. While The Wind in the Door did not impress me as much as its predecessor, I still enjoyed it. The characters were still likable, the writing still good, and the plot still strange. There is still a fight between good and evil and a lot of focus on the power of love. And while this can be a frustrating approach to a story, I find that it works well in this series. I really like Meg and Charles Wallace's mom. I appreciate the fact that she stays at home a lot, caring for her children, while still making discoveries and conducting experiments in her personal lab. She's brilliant and she wants to share that with her children. This is one of my favorite aspects about the stories and the family. I will probably continue the series and listen to the final two books over the next few months. The audio for this one was well done and overall I enjoyed the narrator. "
115,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4428746-sarah-cavar,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book is Torah. That is, it teaches me how to be in the world, and to act in a way that prefigures the world we fight for. L'Engle insightfully explores disability and neurodivergence in a way both inflected with magic, yet not so obscure as to feel tokenizing or distant. More than that, this story provides us possibilities for a love that defies spacetime –– love that even defies the ways kids are bound to hate the petty tyranny of school-middle-management! I'm so glad I returned to this series. As a kid, I didn't like A Wrinkle in Time too much, and never read the rest of these. As an adult, I think, I feel more emotionally and intellectually ready to approach this level of relational death and intellectual exploration. Humility –– an angel learns with mortals, we learn all powerful and non-powerful creatures require each other, always, as Gd (the concept, entity, whatever) requires an ""us"" to know it –– is a major theme in this work. As an adult reader, I, too, am humbled by the magnitude of impact a nominal childrens' book has had on me now, and will continue to have on me. Truly, read this book, it is instructive on living with other human beings and astoundingly, uncannily timely as we deal with a resurgence in fascist violence against humanity itself."

I could never personally fathom how this story was designed for kids: there are parts that I enjoyed and could draw lessons from as a child, but I lost interest as soon as mitochondria and farandolae entered the conversation. This was partially because I was allergic to anything that felt like learning science at that age, but even as an adult I found my attention wandering while some of the concepts were explained. The most touching part of this story is actually the evolution of Meg's relationship with Charles Wallace's severe and uncompromising principal Mr. Jenkins, and embedded lesson about to move beyond our preconceived notions of people and their abilities and find things to value about them. There are also some poignant metaphors for growing up, as Meg, Calvin, Charles Wallace join with creatures from across the galaxy and try to understand each other's rituals for coming of age. If  A Wrinkle in Time was about the relativity of distance in space, A Wind in the Door is about the relativity of size in space, as the humans make friends and get to know creatures as large as galaxies and smaller than human cells."
117,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28598311-d-viaurvandil-ericsson-e-pereira,Rating 5 out of 5,"I read A Wrinkle in Time several years ago and loved it, so recently decided to reread it and continue with the whole ""Time Quintet"". A Wind in the Door greatly surpassed my expectations. I always hold the highest esteem for books that are not only enjoyable to read, but that call me to something higher and have the moral depth to continue doing so for the rest of my life. 	Having recently celebrated another birthday, welcomed my second child into the world, and begun seeking spiritual help for some long-term struggles, I have been recognizing the dire need for authentic and deep relationships with people whom God has put in my life to help me toward holiness. I have tended to be 'transactional' in my dealings with others and turned to myself as the only person I can really know and understand. There are glimpses though, of times when I was able to lay aside concern for myself, open the ears of my heart, and listen to the soul that was in that moment interacting with me -- time of particular tenderness with my wife, time of awe-struck wonder at the birth of my children, time of shared grief at the senseless loss of a family member. It is these glimpses that A Wind in the Door peers through and turns into mighty gusts of inspiration to love. To know somebody, to truly know somebody, and to love that person in truth and spirit, that is one of the highest heights of human experience.	To know someone, to love someone as he is, and to see the Good in him when one is tempted to see only the Bad is a spiritual weapon. It is one of the primary spiritual weapons God uses with us to fight off the seductions of Satan and his demons. When one has received Christ in death and rebirth, has been anointed to be His ambassador, and partakes of His Body and Blood, one can more easily recognize those times when the temptations of the Enemy only lead to a personal un-doing, to a disintegration of the person that is only truly whole when serving God. This starts with God seeing one as he truly is, the faults, the heart, the desires, the potential, and the good one has done and will do. He meets such a person where he is – as He met Abram with his desire to be a great nation and turned him into the spiritual father of countless billions, as He met the apostles and turned their nets to a much more important catch, as He met the woman in sin and transformed her future. God starts by seeking us out, seeing us bare and raw, and asking us to follow – there is no greater way to destroy the machinations of devils than this.	We too have this power. How many accounts do we have of martyrs willing going to their deaths and converting the dutiful soldiers around them? How many have been brought into the Faith because the liturgy was so beautiful that those who were looking for Heaven didn’t know if they had suddenly entered it? How many have had their lives uprooted from a diseased tree and grafted into Life because of a heartfelt listening, talk, and wise counsel? How many passions have been starved due to loving discipleship from a caring leader? Countless many. This power comes from a heart full of love, especially the kind of love God has for us.	A Wind in the Door shows us how something as simple as finding a way to love someone unlovable is greater than being able to move mountains, how a little girl, unsure of herself, misfit, and not popular, shows herself mightier than angels and more important than queens. She is powerful because she learns how to love.	Loving someone is not always easy, nor does it seem Important to love in little ways everyday. A kind response even when exhausted is a little thing and a little love, a letter received in the mail is a little thing and a little love, a chat over a pot of tea is a little thing and a little love, but they have the power to set someone on to greatness, and in that little act of love, a person can be a hero.	One has the temptation to view the ‘little things’ in life as of hardly any cosmic significance. This is especially true of those who love epic fantasy literature of heroic eucatastrophes or science-fiction stories which explore the extreme limits of human experience and speculation. But the everyday actions of a typical daddy at home – reading bedtime stories, playing hide-and-seek, getting honey-do lists done, or picking up flowers and a card for one’s wife “just-because” – are not easily understood as Significant.	Significance comes though, not selfish honor, or grand adventure, or danger and suffering, but how your actions weave into the tapestry set before you. How are your actions, no matter how mundane, contributing to the pattern, design, and beauty that only you, and your unique position can create? Of course, a good number of people have the calling to great deeds of daring, as the need arises and as Providence dictates. As Gandalf says, “All you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to you.” But a great many of us have deeds need-doing much more pressing than slaying dragons and throwing down corrupt rulers. 	So the tiniest of creatures can be a miracle-worker. A farandolae who lives in a mitochondrion can affect the fate of lives. Sporos of a Wind in the Door can be a slayer of those evil beings who desire to un-make (destroy) everything, even though he is made up of nothing but a few atoms himself! All through accepting his calling in life, to choose to direct his love outward, to others, instead of toward serving his own particular personal fancies. 	You too, stay-at-home mother, are essential to the great Providential rescue of all of history, you too, dutiful husband of a typical job, are a man of great renown, you too, obedient child of the Father, add a necessary gust of breath to the great and mighty Wind in the Door."

O primeiro livro, possivelmente por ser o mais famoso da série e pelo filme, torna os personagens e ambientações mais fáceis de serem digeridas. Neste, a mente de Madeleine vai longe. E entendo como isso pode afastar diversas pessoas. Mas, para mim, o como essa história é cativante e as mensagens importantes que nos passam são muito legais.

If A Wrinkle in a Time was a foundational exposition for the Time Quintet series, providing language and world structure, A Wind in The Door was the first taste of Rising Action and a development in the trajectory of the Murry family’s story. The concept of Teachers and Namers and the calling of Creation to step into vocations like these captivated my attention immediately. I observed it as a unique expression in this storyworld of helping readers to recognize the sacred that blooms in every crevice of Creation, and our responsibility to steward that beauty with care and intention, with the very heart of God that does all things out of love. How glorious a calling to be given to be deemed a Namer, and declare the love of God over another, to proclaim that they are beloved through and through?The way in which L’Engle wove the self-sacrificing love of Jesus throughout every galaxy and microscopic world was invigorating and challenging to grasp, and called out to that piece deep in my soul that longs for the Kingdom to come in full throughout all of creation. I think I’m most impressed by the imagination within writers like Lewis and L’Engle to extrapolate basic gospel truths and weave them so seamlessly into worlds of dizzying glory and complexity.

157,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70579317-jerrod-griebel,Rating 4 out of 5,"""Here we are, at the height of civilization in a well-run state in a great democracy. And four ten-year-olds were picked up last week for pushing hard drugs in the school where our six-year-old is regularly given black eyes and a bloody nose"" (97).And with this quote, Madeleine L'Engle welcomes the deeper story behind her novel A Wind in the Door (the sequel to A Wrinkle in Time). The basic story of this novel is both simple and complex, and it could be summarized in a sentence or two. But the depths of its implications and the layers of its meanings are deeply spiritual, theological, and philosophical. In an effort to save her brother Charles Wallace from a mysterious sickness, Meg joins forces the Teacher Blajeny, the cherubim Proginoskes, her best friend Calvin, and a most unlikely character from her brother's school in order to fight off the Echthroi (fallen angels) and convince the faradolae to Deepen within the mitochondria of Charles Wallace's biological cells. Sound too complex for a young-adult novel? Well, that goes to show the depths that L'Engle is willing to journey in her novels.As I read, though, it wasn't all that hard to follow. And that actually leads to my only complaint: occasionally, the characters spend so much time explaining what's going on to one another that I began to lose interest. I'm sure it's important and necessary for youth reading this book, though, so I can't be overly critical. Why I did give this novel a higher rating though, lies in its references to the Bible and the nature of our existence in a sinful, broken world. On this journey, Meg is partnered with Proginoskes and must complete three tasks, the first of which is to Name which of the three Mr. Jenkinses is the real one (the other two being Echthroi). In doing so, L'Engle alludes to Genesis 2:19-20, looking at the power of humans to Name and speak the truth of someone or something, a power that we often overlook and abuse in our day-to-day lives as we speak of others. Later, Proginoskes is described as putting off ""a violent wind, searing tongues of flame"" (212-213), which is a clear reference to Acts 2:2-3. It's these references, along with quotes like ""If someone knows who he is, really knows, then he doesn't need to hate"" (111) or ""Love. That's what makes persons know who they are"" (114) that give this novel a unique richness that I found so appealing. By no means are L'Engle's A Winkle in Time novels for everyone. But her attempts at speaking spiritual truths in young-adult fiction (especially in writing these during the 1970s, just after the ""sex, drugs, & rock-n-roll"" era) show her tenacity and resilience in speaking truth in fiction.To finish this review, I'll end with a profound, sincere quote that speaks a lot of truth, especially to overly-analytic people like me. At this point in the novel, Meg overhears her scientist parents speaking about the seriousness of what's occurring, both in their son and in the galaxy. (Did I mention there are rips occurring out in the galaxy? Yeah, there's a lot happening in this book.) Amid all of that, though, Mr. Murray says this to his wife: ""There are still stars which move in ordered and beautiful rhythm. There are still people in this world who keep promises. Even little ones, like your cooking stew over your Bunsen burner. You may be in the middle of an experiment, but you still remember to feed your family. That's enough to keep my heart optimistic, no matter how pessimistic my mind.  And you and I have good enough minds to know how very limited and finite they really are. The naked intellect is an extraordinarily inaccurate instrument"" (98, emphasis added)."

Also, I love how she melds science fiction with fantasy in somewhat believable ways.I enjoyed this sequel to A Wrinkle in Time but not as much as the first.

Jeśli ta książka dedykowana jest młodemu czytelnikowi, to bardzo mu współczuję. Postaci są tak słabo zarysowani, że szok. Ojciec Meg?

160,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22208207-tessa,Rating 1 out of 5,"I loved A Wrinkle in Time, but I don't think this sequel lives up to it. My biggest issue was that it seemed like such a rehash of Wrinkle, but instead of expanding on it, it retracted. The theme of overcoming hate through love was exactly the same. Unlike the deft social commentary in Wrinkle, though, this book didn't touch on conformity/individuality; instead, it decided to focus on heavy-handed environmentalism, a random dislike of cities, and a rather unfair criticism of the ""younger generations""--unfair considering this is a book about children, written for children. The climax, which involves lots of feelings and mental telepathy just like Wrinkle, went on for too long and was too vague. Once again, Meg has to save Charles Wallace, who seems to be the keystone for all humanity even though he's kind of a pretentious little brat. Once again, Meg expresses all kinds of insecurities and doubts right up until the key moments of the book, when she miraculously comes through. And why do we need to go over the disbelief in the extraordinary, the doubt at meeting new life forms and communicating in new ways? Didn't all these kids just meet strange witch/alien/angel things in the last book, and spend the whole time traveling to other planets? They, more than anyone, shouldn't be surprised when a dragon shows up in their backyard. And yet, they are, and we have to waste time watching them struggle through their doubt all over again. It's as if the first book hadn't even happened (did their memories get erased at the end, and I'm just forgetting that part? If so, sorry for being a jerk). Which is also frustrating--we learned all about dark planets and evil and good beings in the last book, and none of them make an appearance here, even though it's clear this is a sequel and the events in the first book were never totally resolved. This book is the equivalent of having read the first Harry Potter and then, in the second book, having to explain to him that he's a wizard all over again. I do think this book has one strong point, which is the thought exercises it sets up for readers. It doesn't condescend to children, who are the focus audience; it simply is, and children can take it or leave it, just like Wrinkle. Instead of limiting its vocabulary and themes and complexities, as many children's books do, it challenges children and trusts that they can meet that challenge. What could be better for encouraging young readers?"

Moving forward in time a couple years, we catch up with Meg, Calvin, and Charles Wallace as they take on another cosmic adventure. This time around, Charles Wallace is very ill, and Meg and Calvin meet new beings who help them try to save him. Once again, I listened to the book with my 11-year old daughter (after reading it several times in my youth and as an adult). We both found the story somewhat interesting, but not nearly as good as the first book. I felt the story tries too hard to get across its messages of ""everything is connected"" and ""love everyone."" The concepts used became increasingly repetitive and unnecessarily confusing. We both became bored with the Meg's tests, meanwhile, we both were able to figure out and solve Meg's problems well before she did.Ms. Ehle does a good job with her narration, although I did enjoy Ms. Davis's performance in A Wrinkle in Time a bit more. At first, it was hard not to compare the two performances, but after a while, I could appreciate Ms. Ehle's work on its own merit. She has a calming presence and captures the exuberant nature of Meg.

162,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30274173-colleen,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 Stars This series meant so much to me growing up. Rereading it as an adult has been both nostalgic and enjoyable. A Wind in the Door is a slightly different turn than A Wrinkle in Time. Both stories look at the state of humanity as well as the importance of each person’s action. Whereas the plot of the first book had a marco view, A Wind in the Door has to do with micro. Very micro. As in mitochondria. L’Engle was so great at weaving scientific theory into engaging stories. 
“You and I have good enough minds to know how very limited and finite they really are. The naked intellect is an extraordinarily inaccurate instrument.”
This really challenged my perceptions when I first read it. Part of the story has to do with forgiving someone who has wronged you. And I won’t lie, my fourteen-year-old self was full of righteous indignation at the thought of just forgiving and forgetting. But Meg struggles with that same issue in A Wind in the Door. Good books make you think. They challenge your views. They can help you grow. And when all of that is wrapped up in a smart compelling story with magnetic characters, then you definitely have an amazing book on your hands.RATING FACTORS:Ease of Reading: 5 StarsWriting Style: 5 StarsCharacters and Character Development: 5 StarsPlot Structure and Development: 5 StarsLevel of Captivation: 5 StarsOriginality: 5 Stars"

It was my first experience with an audiobook, so that was neat, and I did enjoy it. The story itself was enjoyable—nothing extraordinarily good or bad. The characters definitely grated on me a bit, but mostly, I liked them. I did really like that Mr. Jenkins became such an important character in the story. It was completely unexpected but I enjoyed how it turned out. That said, I think my annoyance with some characters was just a symptom of my actual problem with the novel: the pacing. It was all over the place. One scene could be stretched out for a ridiculously long time (i.e. the opening chapter) and others would be over in a second. I think it was particularly noticeable with regards to the three ordeals. The first ordeal was stretched and stretched well beyond necessary, and then the second and third happened within minutes of one another and not long before the end of the novel, making it feel like they were suddenly crammed in. The odd pacing made for a very jaunty reading experience.Other than that, it was fine. I liked the science-fiction elements and Proginoskes was rad, and the rest was good. I'll definitely continue with the series, but at this point, I have very three-star expectations for the rest of the series."

A Wrinkle in Time was a pivotal book for me. I identified with Meg, and I loved the Murry family with their emphasis on studying the world and making the world a better place. I couldn't wait to read book two, but the ending left a lot of things unclear, and remember also being frustrated with how the battle against bad guys not only had to be fought in outer space but also on a microscopic level. I felt those same things with this read, but somehow time has tamped that down and I have a new appreciation for the wisdom of the fight and the ways that Meg and her companions were able to overcome the bad with good. Just a bit about the plot: Meg's younger brother, Charles Wallace, has started school and he is suffering from bullying as well as from some mysterious mitochondrial ailment. Meg is approached by a cherubim and a teacher who guide her into action as Meg and her companions (one of whom is, intriguingly, her arch-enemy and former principal, Mr. Jenkins) must leap into action."
166,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"A Wind in the Door by Madeleine L'EngleThis is the second in a series of five - I read ""A Wrinkle in Time"" quite a while ago and it is one of my favorite books (although I hardly remember much of it - thus why I've started writing book reviews, to remember how and why different books moved me). A Wrinkle in Time amazed me for its incredible interweaving of science, science-fiction, and faith - it was so unique and I feel as if many books that are popular today, are just (mostly bad) variations of this original.A Wind in the Door reminded me of this again.It had been too long ago for me to remember the characters - but I had to assume they were the same ones - Meg was the central character, beginning high school I guess but worrying over her youngest brother, Charles Wallace, who is in first grade and getting beat up everyday because he's different. The father is off in Washington addressing some galactic phenomena, the mother is working on proving the existence of something immeasurable small. They are scientists, and the children are unusual and smart too - they are all open to the unknown especially because of what they know. So when the story begins with Charles Wallace claiming to have seen dragons, Meg believes its what Charles Wallace believes he saw - but she's not so sure it to be true - in fact, she realizes how sick Charles Wallace actually appears. Through several phenomenal events, she is quickly pulled into a fight for Charles Wallace's life and the balance of the universe with her friend Cal, her principal, a cherubim, and a Teacher. what I liked: Wow. There were many lines I connected with - Meg's ""hate"" for not loving Mr. Jenkins, which was actually hating herself. The power of being Named. For most of the book I had the Moana song running through my head - when she faced the lava monster in the end, unafraid and sang:I've crossed the horizon to find you.I know your name.They have stolen the heart from inside you.But this does not define you.This is not who you are.You know who you are.This, along with Greg Boyd's mantra of telling individual's ""you are of unsurpassable worth"" - it's powerful stuff - for in all of our growth and gain, we are forgetting and losing the most central part of ourselves.What I didn't like/confused about: Meg's doubt was so redundant. I'm a bit confused about the setting too. They feel and sound British to me - but I think they mention finally New England. The year is confusing too - it sounds modern, but I keep picture an English countryside. When I looked up the books online -even the publishing dates of the series was confusing. This one was published in 1978? There was scene where Mrs. Murry and Dr. Lousie were recalling the man on the moon - and Dr. Louise said Mrs. Murry would have been too young which isn't believable considering she has four kids, and probably more than one PhD, and its confusing too as the characters came across as they same age to me.Two quotes I'm not sure I agree with:""Why do people always mistrust people who are different?""""People are always hostile to anybody who's different.""I think you could make a case for the opposite - that people are drawn to different. There is a type of different that is refreshing, and there is a ""different"" that we all may not consciously search for, but we know it when we see it.What I would have like to read: There was was a lot of dialogue indicating urgency and time pressure, but then a lot of continued dialogue. The actual action ended up being very little.Quotes:Interesting line: ""The gaping rows where once beans had stood, and lettuce, and peas, had a forlorn look; there was an air of sadness and confusion about the carefully planned pattern.""Lines that rung true to me: ""I think your mythology would call them fallen angels. War and hate are their business, and one of the chief weapons is un-Naming - making people not know who they are. If someone knows who he is, really knows, then he doesn't need to hate. That's why we still need Namers, because there are places throughout the universe like your planet Earth. When everyone is really and truly Named, then the Echtroi will be vanquished.""""Oh, Mr. Jenkins, don't you see? Every time I was in your office, being awful and hating you, I was really hating myself more than you. Mother was right. She told me that you underestimate yourself.""""So you mean on your earth host you never communicate with each other and with other planets? You mean your planet revolves about all isolated in space? Aren't you terribly lonely? Isn't he?""""He?""""Or she. Your planet. Aren't you lonely?""""Maybe we are, a little,"" Calvin conceded. ""But it's a beautiful planet.""""But human beings need Deepening Places, too. And far too many never have any.""""Mr. Jenkins. Unique, as every star in the sky is unique, every leaf on every tree, every snowflake, every farandole, every cherubim, unique: Named.""""'All I need to know is that all the galaxies, all the stars, all creatures, cherubic, human, farandole, all, all, are known by Name.' He seemed almost to crooning to himself.""""The temptation for farandole or for man or for star is to stay an immature pleasure-seeker. When we seek our own pleasure as the ultimate good we place ourselves as the center of the universe. a farm or a man or a star has his place in the universe, but nothing created is the center.""""We are the song of the universe. We sing with the angelic host. We are the musicians. The far and the stars are the singers. Our song orders the rhythm of creation.""'It is only when we are fully rooted hat we are really able to move."""

I was prepared to be a little let down, to discover these books weren't as brilliant as they seemed to my pre-teen self, and sure enough I was a little let down. HOWEVER, I was thrilled again by the mitochondria, alive in a way that I'd never thought of microscopic organisms could be. Perhaps the stars and the atoms aren't as sentient as L'Engle portrays them, but the possibility that they COULD be just fires me up. I've never forgotten about mitochondria all these years because she enchanted them for me. I studied them later in my life and found the scientific study of them more interesting because of this. If I ever write my book, I can't wait to find ways to re-enchant the world in the way L'Engle did for me."

Or were those who had Xed themselves that she might live the only ones who would defy the Echthroi?""So this is on page 189 of 212, but I can assure you that if you read the book from the beginning, it wouldn't make any more sense than if you only read that paragraph.

It was very sciencey and I wasn't really sure which parts were real science and which parts were science fiction. Frankly, I was very bored by the halfway point. I will still continue with the series to see what happens, but I really hope the next book is a little more exciting. "

Personally, I loved the identification through “Naming” found throughout the book. The idea pushes me to consider who I am and what else actually matters. Meg and especially Mr. Jenkins struggle to release themselves from physical constructs, but their journey is realistic to how I imagine most of us actually dealing with the ideas L’Engle portrays. "

The nature of love, of the self, of “naming” others, of our role in being (more than doing). I’m here for the collateral “damage” the book has done to me. "

202,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9086236-chaitra,Rating 2 out of 5,"One of the things I wanted to know in this book was what happened to Camatosz. Turns out A Wind in the Door is set two years after A Wrinkle of Time, and there is no mention of Camatosz. Neither are Mrs. Whatsit, Who or Which present. I should have liked this better, and I might have, if I didn't feel like throwing things at all characters except for maybe Charles Wallace. What is it with Meg? There's her six year old brother, black and blue because he gets beaten by bullies in his school, talking about how difficult it is for him to be the brilliant son of two brilliant people. Meg, agreeing with him that their parents didn't do them favors, but in her case it's because she'd never be as beautiful as her mother. Her brother is very sick and hurting and this is what she thinks of. God Meg, get some perspective, why don't you. Then we get told over and over that she loves her family, and yes, she does, but this girl is so tone-deaf and needy that it's awfully annoying. And there's the giant Teacher, who teaches, I'm not sure what. He says Meg has to do three tasks, and then says he's not sure what the trials are. Meg has to find it herself. She has a partner, a cherubim, who recognizes the tasks for her. Why the teacher was needed, I'm not sure. However, I do think Meg drew the short straw in the Teacher department. We get to meet two other Teachers and both of those seem more responsible than Meg's guy. Especially the snake. And in any case, ancient beings once again shirk their duties and let teenagers do their jobs without even any instructions. There is Calvin. The random dude has a name I can finally retain. He's quite randomly added to the plot even when he's not anywhere close to the events occurring. He is also actually quite sufficient to the plot without actually adding another character, Meg's real teacher. He's okay for Meg's first task and the denouement about what the evil things really are, but there was no real reason for him to join them in their further trials. He gets a choice and he opts to go with them, so it's not like he was ""really"" needed. It's more like Meg gets a chance to throw some exposition at him for the benefit of the reader. But, Meg is usually the one the exposition gets thrown at - in fact she's being told what to tell Mr. Jenkins by the cherubim - so there wasn't any need for Mr. Jenkins' character. I'm not willing to believe in Meg's growth arc yet, because whatever maturity Meg had gained at the end of the first book, there was no evidence of that in the second.This is a book of Madeleine L'Engle's philosophies, and while I don't think they're necessarily bad, there's one thing I really can't get on board with. It's conforming to mediocrity - Charles Wallace is brilliant, others in his school are not, even the teachers. And the solution is for Charles Wallace to hide, to pretend that he is less than what he is, so that the bullies can feel better about themselves I guess. No. One of the main reasons I didn't want to read the first one out loud to my own child is because of the same theory present in the first book. It's a little exacerbated here. Stop protecting the bullies, maybe the kids who are so intimidated by a few big words that they throw punches at little ones are the ones that need adapting, maybe they are the ones who need lessons by beings who do not look like them, and are vastly wiser than they are. (That is why I prefer Narnia, with all its Christian connotations, where one arrogant thing gets turned into a dragon to learn compassion). The final thing that bothered me, and it's not even important at this point, but the end plot is pretty much the same regardless of the setting. There is someone whose arrogance is their undoing (Charles Wallace in the first, Sporos in the second) and Meg is the only one who can save them because she can fill everything with love. It's kind of not even mentioned any more that Meg's intelligence sets her apart, her sole concern is for her appearance. I'm trying to read these with an open mind because this book series is so beloved, but I can't see what others are seeing. "
203,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27138736-amy-meyers,Rating 2 out of 5,"Sigh. 2.5, maybe a 3? I don't think I'll re-read this one ever again. There were a lot of things about it that really didn't make sense to me. If L'Engle is trying to help Christians in their faith, she's way too mystical to help much with this one. It actually irritated me at times: She still pushes evolution ""I've been reading Darwin, but he hasn't helped me much,"" says Charles Wallace; I can't tell how much of her science is fiction, how much fact (it seems mostly science fantasy), how much religion; I hate books where the main characters go through ""tests,"" but it's not clear what they are or why?--basically bad plot development; bad character development--why is Mr. Jenkins a major-ish character in this sequel at all??; kything seems like some sort of Buddhism or Hinduism or just plain sorcery but prettier; terms like ""Xed"" that you're not sure how to say for a while...just oddities all throughout it. I didn't feel a tie to Meg or Charles Wallace either in this book or in Wrinkle, but at least in Wrinkle, it was much better. Sometimes the philosophizing is good, sometimes a bit pushy. Some quotes:""Her father must have mentioned the terrible thing which Proginoskes had just shown her, the terrible thing which was terrible precisely because it was not a thing, because it was nothing. She could hear, too clearly, her father's voice, calm and rational, speaking to her mother, 'It isn't just in distant galaxies that strange, unreasonable things are happening. Unreason has crept up on us so insidiously that we've hardly been aware of it. But think of the things going on in our own country which you wouldn't have believed possible only a few years ago.""This reminded me a little of C.S. Lewis:""Meg had turned...at the pain in her mother's voice, and had seen her father reach across the table for her mother's hand. 'My dear, this is not like you. With my intellect I see cause for nothing but pessimism and even despair. But I can't settle for what my intellect tells me. That's not all of it.''What else is there?' Mrs. Murry's voice was low and anguished.'There are still stars which move in ordered and beautiful rhythm. There are still people in this world who keep promises. Even little ones, like your cooking stew over your Bunsen burner. You may be in the middle of an experiment, but you still remember to feed your family. That's enough to keep my heart optimistic, no matter how pessimistic my mind. And you and I have good enough inds to know how very limited and finite they really are. The naked intellect is an extraordinarily inaccurate instrument.'""I wondered if Andrew Peterson got his idea of the importance of names for his Wingfeather Saga from this:""...one of their chief weapons is un-Naming--making people not know who they are. If someone knows who he is, really knows, then he doesn't need to hate. That's why we still need Namers, because there are places throughout the universe like your planet Earth. When everyone is really and truly Named, then the Echthroi will be vanquished."" Mph. This was too close to ""knowing yourself"" postmodern jargon and hate speech connected...didn't feel comfortable with that.I kind of liked the importance of denying yourself in order to grow up...""When Sporos Deepens, it means that he comes of age. It means that he grows up. The temptation for farandola or for man or for star is to stay an immature pleasure-seeker. When we seek our own pleasure as the ultimate good we place ourselves as the center of the universe. A fara or a man or a star has his place in the universe, but nothing created is the center.""I think the conflict resolution was really stupid. She named WHOM??? Are you kidding me???????? Not saying more, because it's a spoiler, but it just doesn't make sense at all, to any Christian. The enemy as presented in this book cannot ever be reclaimed or evil is good and good is evil, and nothing is nothing anymore. Just doesn't make sense."

I picked it up for a little escapism (as a treat), and while some bits reminded me of the struggles our own country and world are facing at the moment, overall I found it a good read. It was great to see some more non-earth characters and settings, though they could have been a bit better developed; my imagination is out of practice, so sometimes it was hard for me to picture them in my mind's eye.Passages that stood out:Meg asked nervously, ""Is it dangerous, this-this ripping in the sky, or whatever it is?""""Meg, we really know nothing about it.

As the dance progressed, the movement accelerated, and the pattern became clearer, closer, wind and fire moving together, and there was joy, and song, melody soaring, gathering together as wind and fire united.""You must stop thinking about size, you know.

205,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43483275-andrew-sammut,Rating 1 out of 5,"There are very few books which I give a single star upon completion. This is one of them. It's a shame since I had higher hopes after enjoying the first book so much. Meg being in Charles Wallace created a very weird aura. And if there's a character who knows the names of all the stars in the universe, why doesn't he just go about and name them all before they are wiped out of existence? This volume literally just went about in pointless circles and it just feels as though L'Engle is proud to have created so many new words to describe the universe and creatures which have very little character development despite their lengthy descriptions and extended narrative. Bored me out of my mind ngl I think I am going to get rid of the box set because I don't see myself reading the rest of the series. Frankly, I am surprised that this one has an average rating of 4 stars. At least we get a glimpse of Meg's future love life, Calvin. As a Family Guy enjoyer, the name Meg never rubs me the right way and Meg's character and attitude in this volume is almost as terrible as the family guy Meg who is one of the few characters I despise. They both deserve all the bullying for being pretentious and acting superior just because of their parents' intellect. They should be smarter than that, they should know how to behave socially and what's expected from them by society and how to act in a social context. Both Meg and Charles Wallace suck, one could perhaps also blame the way they were raised. I suppose you could argue that geniuses are hardly ever respected by society but an author has to at least have a shred of intelligence to write genius characters and L'Engle obviously lacks such a trait. The interview provided even confirmed this. There were points in this book that were hardly comprehensible and L'Engle lost her own trail of thought, describing the same scenarios and giving the same details over and over again. Awful read, it's a shame that kids are exposed to such novels because they are hardly imaginative or original. Very disappointed :(What do you think of this one or the series in general?"
206,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5082359-bev,Rating 4 out of 5,"Meg Murry and Calvin O'Keefe are off on another fantastic journey. This time to save Charles Wallace and the universe. Charles Wallace is very sick--that is, his mitochondria are very sick. And Charles Wallace is one of those people in history who is so important that their existence has wide-ranging effects. If Charles Wallace dies so too will much of what is. To save Meg's brother, they will need to team up with Proginoskes, a cherubim who looks like a drive of dragons; Blajeny, a cosmic Teacher; Sporos, a farandola (a fictional part of the mitochondria); and...of all people, the despised Mr. Jenkins, school principal.Most of the responsibility will rest on Meg--who is, in the grand scheme of things, a Namer. She has the power to give people and things the understanding of their real name. As Proginoskes tells her, once people really know who they are, they don't have any reason to hate. Hate and war give power to the Echthroi (likened to fallen angels) who are driven to un-Name everything and destroy all of creation. Meg is given three tests--through which she learns how to name, how to love--even those we don't really like, and how to overcome power of un-Naming. She draws strength from her friend Calvin and from Mr. Jenkins--who learns to value his own worth enough to make sacrifices for the children. I can remember reading this series as a child and loving the mysteriousness, adventure, and wonder. It is very easy to lose yourself in L'Engle's world and not worry whether everything makes sense or not. She has a very sure way of combining science with religious themes that makes them all tie together very nicely and gives reader very interesting battles between good and evil that capture the imagination as well as entertain. It was great fun to revisit the world of the Murrys again and lose myself in fantasy as I did when I was young.First posted on my blog My Reader's Block."
207,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"“The Time Trilogy” is a set of three science fantasy books written by Madeleine L’Engle, including: A Wrinkle in Time, A Wind in the Door, and A Swiftly Tilting Planet. In the second book, A Wind in the Door, Charles Wallace is feeling ill. Ms. Murray identifies a problem in the farandolae of his mitochondria. On top of that, he is also being bullied and isolated at school because of his extremely high intelligence. His school principal, Mr. Jenkins, refuses to protect Charles. One day Charles tells Meg about a drive of dragons that Charles has seen roaming around. Meg gets proof of this when she finds weird feathers. They also identify the dragons as a single Cherubim. The Cherubim is led by a humanoid creature named Blajeny. Benjy then tasks the kids with defeating the echthroi, the things that been destroying Charles Wallace's Farandolae. Meg's first task is to differentiate the real Mr. Jenkins from the two ecotri fakes by trying to find the potential good in him, which meg is successful in. Instead as viewing Mr. Jenkins as a purely hatred filled person, she views him as, “ something deeper, more real, beyond, past, through the senses, something which was the true person” (455). This shows that it may not seem like it, but there is good in everyone. The protagonists then travel into Charles Wallace's mitochondria to persuade a larva farandolae to pursue its role as a mature fara. However, Mr. Jenkins is invaded with the echthroi and the cherubim has to sacrifice himself to save them. In my opinion, this story was a little but easier to follow that the first because you are already familiar with the characters, so you can understand the plot better. However, I didn't know that there was any relation with the previous book besides the characters and that made the story seem a little odd and out of place. The conversations seem a little bland and not smooth enough to seem realistic. Overall, the second book is similar to the first in that it is too fantasy-like to be fully convincing."
208,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53920101-shannon-greene,Rating 2 out of 5,"I feel sort of bad for giving this low of a rating, because this is such a quintessential children's novel and because Madeleine L'Engle is such a legendary author. But try as I might, I could not get into this book.First of all, it is super weird that in this book there is absolutely no mention or no connection to ""A Wrinkle in Time,"" the first book of the ""Time Quintet."" Meg and Calvin and Charles Wallace had previously gone on this crazy adventure to rescue Dr. Murray, and yet their experiences are never once discussed even in passing. It is like ""A Wind in the Door"" is completely standalone book with no connection to ""A Wrinkle in Time.""Furthermore, it is as if no character development happened between ""A Wrinkle in Time"" and ""A Wind in the Door."" Throughout the whole second book, Meg was still the same insufferable, whiney girl that we discovered at the beginning of the first book. She had traveled to other planets and other galaxies in ""A Wrinkle,""--risking her own life for her father and her brother--yet she was still disbelieving and hard to convince during her adventures of this book.Finally, the book had a super abrupt ending. There was this huge buildup with a lengthy amount of time introducing the characters, explaining farandolae and mitochondria and Echthroi, and going over the need to be ""Named."" Then, there is quite a bit of time spent on Meg's first ordeal (naming the true Mr. Jenkins) and Meg's second ordeal (getting the farandola Sporos to deepen). Then, very quickly, readers are moved to the third ordeal, and then it is over in flash and a bang. Suddenly, they are all back in Charles Wallace's room as if nothing had happened.Overall, the most redeeming quality of this book was the idea of being ""Named,"" and that everyone has something within them that is worthy of being loved, even the mean principal Mr. Jenkins."
209,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30079754-octavia-cade,Rating 3 out of 5,"I know there are people that simply love this series, but I've yet to manage anything more than basic liking. It baffles me, mostly. There's a lot of it I do like - and I liked this better than Wrinkle in Time, if only because less of it is this strange semi-religious view of the universe. Basically, as in the previous volume: I like the characters. By which I mean the human characters. The determined mysticism that wafts around all the non-human characters leaves me absolutely cold, though. And when that mysticism touches the human characters, I kind of stop caring about them too. Let me give an example: I felt much, much more for Meg when she went to see Mr. Jenkins to try and stop her little brother being bullied than I did when she was in screaming agony from the creatures that wanted to X her. That... doesn't do much for suspension of disbelief.I do see what L'Engle is trying to do, and I'm going to keep reading the series regardless, but if a children's fantasy series is going to play with spirituality and the structure of the universe, then the approach that Philip Pullman takes, in his Dark Materials universe for example, is one that really speaks to me. This doesn't. And that's alright, because different approaches appeal to different people... and L'Engle's approach, I can't help it, reminds me of crop circles and crystals and all things woo. Meg's parents can be as super-sciency as can be, but when their daughter is dancing circles within the mitochondria of cells as they sing to the universe, while mentally communicating with an invisible dragon who is really a cherubim, well. This is the type of thing little Fox Mulder ate up with a spoon, I bet. "
210,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29990277-chad-ryan,Rating 3 out of 5,"I wanted to like this book more than I did.Conceptually, the book is really cool. I love how L'Engle jumps around from the cosmic to the microscopic, ultimately to show the interrelatedness of all things (which our fixation on size & time masks, which results in seeing reality as fragmented). (Whereas A Wrinkle in Time took the characters further & further out into expanse of the universe, A Wind in the Door takes them further & further into the recesses of the human cell!) The bizarrely diverse cast of characters are quite fun, and they also demonstrate interrelatedness, but of a different type: of the material, magical, & spiritual dimensions of reality. In terms of themes/meaning, like A Wrinkle in Time, there are a number of dialogues w/ gems of thought-provoking wisdom. (I especially liked the concept of being ""X'ed"": you either join the bad guys and get X'ed...or you join the good guys and allow yourself to be X'ed--either way, you will getted X'ed. L'Engle brilliantly leaves unresolved the question of the fates of those who have been X'ed in these two different ways, ultimately leaving it up to the reader to discern what fate God [I suppose?] assigns them to.)But there are significant weaknesses in this book. Although the concepts, characters, & themes are entertaining & thought-provoking, they are also half-baked (or even a quarter-baked in some cases!). This is mostly b/c there are simply too many of them! Some concepts aren't given enough space to be developed, and others are developed extensively but poorly so that it is difficult to understand what it even is (e.g., naming/loving, kything). As for themes/meaning, I'm convinced that it's a difficult book to analyze b/c the book itself isn't even sure what it's about."

The emotions and innocence between the characters is beautiful and adorable all at the same time. I love the relationship between the siblings ESPECIALLY. The imagery that she uses is so thematic to today's world even though it was written 50 years ago. She explains (on multiple levels) how caring for your peer is caring for yourself and she also dives deep into the theme of depression and the allure of feeling nothing and how nice that must be. There are characters that try to derail their lessons purely by saying ""come with us and you will be nothing and FEEL NOTHING"" and to so many people fighting depression this rings SO TRUE it's incredible. Lastly, she talks about looking for the good in people who you are certain are you enemy and find that good and holding on to it for dear life because it could save you. Empathizing with others will save us all <3 Going to take a break from this series for awhile because it honestly takes up a lot of head space to imagine all the things she wants you to imagine.Favorite quotes: ""she saw with a flash of intuition that her kything was like a small child's trying to pick out a melody on the piano with one finger, as against the harmony of a full orchestra""""I don't understand your feelings. I'm trying to, but I don't. It must be extremely unpleasant to have feelings.""""Meg sighed with a kind of anxious fatigue"" ""But human begins need Deepening places too. And far too many never have any. Think about your deepening places, meg."" ""It is only when we are fully rooted that we are really able to move."" "

I liked it enough to pick up a sequel when I saw it at the library. If I had to buy the book I probably wouldn't get it or read it. What I found really weird about this book is there was absolutely no mention of the events that happened in the first book, not even a smallest nod to it. You could read this as a stand alone, never knowing it's a part of the series.The characters in the first book were tolerable, but in this one they were utterly annoying. Meg was still whiny as ever. And don't get me started on how everyone in this book is sooo special. The mother cooks stew on a Bunsen burner and remembers to feed her family even though she is in the middle of an experiment! For heaven's sake! I couldn't get passed that sentence and it annoyed me throughout the whole book!The last third was so boring and repetitive. First, things were explained to one group of characters, then when they got it they explained it again to another group of characters! I was like alright, I get it! I realise that this book is for children, but I don't think children are that stupid that they couldn't get it the first time. It was a bunch of nonsense, anyway. I thought about reading more from this series just because they are available at the library, but as I'm writing this review (or maybe even a rant!) I realise I don't want to waste any more of my time on this, even though they are fairly short and quick reads. "

Is he sick and seeing things b/c he’s started school and kids are beating him up every day?The “dragons” are actually a cherubim, along w/ a tall, black teacher whom I picture as Lawrence Fishbourne, although he’s described as black, not Black. Anyway, Meg has to learn to “kythe” ( mind read) w/ the cherubim in order to pass three “tests” — I’m not really clear why, but it has to do w/ saving the universe and also saving Charles Wallace from his illness, which is apparently mitochondritis. He is running out of energy, literally, b/c his mitochondria are shutting down.Meg learns that size does not matter; that we are all “one” in the universe; that even nasty old principals have a role to play in “saving” said universe; and that, again, love conquers all.I liked “...Door” better than “...Wrinkle...,” maybe b/c I actually understood about mitochondria, my favorite cell organelle. (Yes, I am a fan of cell biology.) The major fault I kind find is that the black teacher just “disappeared” and didn’t matter much to the plotline thereafter. He was set up to be a major player. Oh welll. I would actually give “A Wind in the Door” 4.5 stars."

I mean sure, he was spoken of a lot, but it's just not the same :/ and the whole bit with him being sick because his farandolae were f---ing up, and thus his mitochondria were dying and thus he was dying and yet somehow Meg (and Calvin and Progos and Mr Jenkins (x a million I swear) and kind-of Sporos) were somehow able to go inside one of his mitochondrion and convince a Farandolae to ""deepen"" and thus save him from death (because clearly ONE mitochondrion dying as a result of Sporos not deepening is going to kill him or somehow have a ripple effect and kill off all the others..I just didn't feel that the story was as well thought out as the previous one, and the new terminology every few sentences (with no REAL explanation to what they were) was just irritating.

Tutaj poznajemy nowych bohaterów, cherubina i nauczyciela, ale ich osobowości są słabo zarysowane w porównaniu do pań z ""Pułapki czasu"". Podoba mi się, że ""Przeciąg w drzwiach"" oddaje skalę mikro problemu, który w poprzednim tomie został zarysowany w skali makro. Na poziomie komórkowym zachodzą te same mechanizmy, co na poziomie astrofizyki, wszechświat przegląda się sam w sobie, gwiazdy mają swoje obicia w mitochondriach i wszystko jest połączone. To jest przekaz, który rozumiem i który uważam za rozpaczliwie potrzebny w naszym skazanym na zagładę świecie. Problemem powieści jest to, że nie tyle próbuje coś przekazać, co wbić do głowy młotkiem. Meg staje się niemal figurą chrystusową, ze swoją zdolnością do miłości i samopoświęcenia, co byłoby ciekawe, gdyby zostało lepiej napisane. Wiem, że to przede wszystkim powieść dla dzieci, więc subtelność jest tutaj na poziomie ""Opowieści z Narni"": nieistniejąca. Z drugiej strony, tak działa konwencja, więc trzeba to przełknąć. Ale cieszę się, że mogłam sobie przypomnieć lekturę z dzieciństwa i mam nadzieję, że w końcu wydadzą w Polsce kolejne trzy tomy, których nigdy nie miałam okazji przeczytać. "

That evening, Charles Wallace accompanies Meg and Calvin to the vegetable garden to meet Blajeny, their teacher in this adventure, and the “dragon”, Proginoskes. It turns out that Progo isn’t a dragon at all, but a cherubim, a type of angel. Blajeny tells them that Charles Wallace is quite ill, due to an imbalance in his mitochondrion. Meg, Calvin, and Mr. Jenkins, along with Sporos, who is a farondola from one of Charles Wallace’s mitochondria, must figure out a way to save Charles Wallace. In doing so, they will keep the balance of the universe in check and protect it from the evil Echthros, who are the cause of all war and evil in the universe. In my experience, sequels don’t always live up to the original story. That’s definitely not the case with A Wind in the door. It’s just as well written as its predecessor and I really enjoyed getting to know the Murry family and Calvin better. Once again, Madeleine L’Engle manages to incorporate both science and Christian concepts in a way that shows that the two don’t have to be at opposition with each other all the time. While, at first, I was a little disappointed that our beloved ladies from book one: Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Which, and Mrs. Who didn’t return, Blajeny and Progo were excellent additions and teachers. The story does an amazing job at showing that even something that seems to be too tiny to make a real difference, it can have a major effect, that one person can affect the entire universe. It also shows that even those that we consider unlovable are worth reaching out to and finding out what makes them unique and lovable. I dearly loved this book and am looking forward to further adventures with these wonderful characters."

The MC shows no growth in maturity from the last novel, in fact, she seems to have digressed. Also the exact same story template is used, which makes it much to predictable and does not keep the reader interested, I doubt I will continue to read the series unless I hear it gets much, MUCH better. Sooooo much of the book is just dialogue composed of Meg asking the same questions over and over again, which gets so exhausting I just want to shake her and say, are you just messing with these people or what? It made me really fall out of love with her. I am also INCREDIBLY concerned as to why Charles Wallace has symptoms of leukemia and is being treated by a non-medical doctor and a family doctor making house calls - not a good book for a nurse. The writer should have placed him in a hospital, it makes me think she didn't want to research anything about medical care. That is a copout, writers should be learners because what they write, teaches.I wish I would not have read this second one. Two stars only for the creativity, would have otherwise given it a one. I would not recommend reading this. :( "

(An odd coincidence: my grandmother’s married name was Margaret Murray.) Here Meg is teamed up with a cherubim and her brother Charles’s struggling head-teacher to learn lessons and fight mystic battles among the mitochondria of Charles’ failing body. To be honest, it’s less humane and less magical than the previous book, and there are several longish chapters of Meg lost in the void, without physical form, communicating through dialogue with unseen allies and enemies, Proust could (just about) get away with taking fifty pages to walk up a flight of stairs, but L’Engle doesn’t quite pull it off. Still, it’s an encouraging, positive, imaginative book, and I think the yung readers of 1973 would have been glad to have a sequel, even if it wasn’t quite up to the mark."

The characters are much more complexly drawn and the situations they face—adapting to new surroundings, dealing compassionately with people they deeply dislike, etc. are presented much more compellingly, even though the stakes in the first book could be argued as being higher (saving the galaxy and all that). There’s a lot more philosophical/religious talk here, which might be off-putting to some readers but which I quite enjoyed, and at times found frankly beautiful and inspiring. The blend of science (molecular biology) and magical / religious elements is mostly very well done, though especially toward the end it tips a bit into too-outlandish / hard to follow territory (hence losing a few points from me.

221,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,I read the book A Wind In The Door by Madeleine L’engle. I really liked this book because it was very interesting and had a lot of exciting adventures as the book went along. The main characters of the story were Meg and her little brother Charles Wallace. Throughout the story meg and her brother have some complications with his health. During the story everyone knew that Charles was special because even for a little boy he was very smart and I don’t think it helped that both of his parents were scientists. While in the school the kids would bully Charles because they knew he was different. During the story Meg and Charles go on different adventures but her friend Calvin also comes along and helps. Although Charles Wallace cannot come on all of the adventures because he is sick he still gets to know all the fun. In the story I like how the author wrote the story and how she got her fans reading the book to get sucked in by all the drama that was happening. I also like how the author ended the book with a happy ending and how everything just fell into place. I think this book would be good for teen readers because it talks about going to a different time in place and also has dragons which I think all teens like. I would recommend this book to people who like time travel and dragons and adventure I know I sure did.

It is most similar to(yet much better than) A Swiftly Tilting Planet than to the others of the series. The scenes are mostly slow and drawn-out, but somehow they are immersive instead of tedious. There are wonderful intersecting character arcs for Meg and Mr. Jenkins, and some enigmatic but oddly appealing new charactersI was much sadder than I expected to be when Progo Xed himself.. Despite the odd pacing, A Wind in the Door is a graceful and tense story that builds up to a harrowing peak. It's not my very favorite of the series, but L'Engle still did a great job at building a story around her own unique blend of religion and science."

It opened my mind to a lot of ideas and being ok with not knowing everything but trying to learn as much as I can because new ideas can truly be mind-blowing.I LOVE the theme that we are all connected and we have to care for each other, even if we don't necessarily like or understand each other.There is a LOT of re-explanation of the same ideas over and over again...which is part of Meg's character not understanding the situation.

This started well, and there are some fine elements - the whole face off of the multiple Jenkinses is well done with proper gradations of voice. Once we get to the dancing Farandolae I wanted the plot to be over, done, finished. I don't think L'Engle is able to make more than one character per book three dimensional, and the rest just stand around mouthing fine speeches or reacting. I know there are many readers who treasure these books, and I'm not saying they are wrong, I'm just saying that I don't. I'm going to read all five books, and after that I think I'll delete them. "

It was fascinating to hear the harmony and peaceful sounds of different vitamins and minerals like magnesium and then the sounds of the heavy metals, etc that sounded like death and chaos.

I love the REAL-ness of these books, how everything is explained in such a way as to make you go ""yeah, that could totally happen and make sense!""

I don't think I would have liked it half as much if the characters I admired in the 1st book weren't in this one.

230,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58131375-kate,Rating 4 out of 5,I think there’s something really special and wonderful about children’s books. Especially this series. It gives you this warm feeling inside and reminds you that the innocence of childhood is important and that teaching children about doing good and being good in all circumstances to all people is important. Le’Engle (much like Rowling did years later) focuses on the importance of love in combating the bad things in the world. That loving is probably the most important thing we can teach people to do and to especially use that love to combat evil in the world. It’s so interesting re-reading your childhood favorites later. Side note - glad mitochronditis is actually not a real disease.

Well you could take my word for what that looks like or you could just read about Meg’s journey in A Wind in the Door. L’Engle’s science fiction world expands her readers’ imaginations of the cosmos not as empty space, but teeming with life and beauty on the macro and micro level.

Even still it’s interesting and I like the dynamics between the kids and at the attempt at embedding something of the author in the text. I’d much rather a book be about something then not, even if it’s got a pinch too much religion. I couldn’t handle Narnia at all, so this is much better than that at least, imo. "
241,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/102051822-kristin-mooney,Rating 3 out of 5,"I really want to like this series, and on some level I do, but...It's definitely meant for kids, which is ironic because I think the message of it would have totally been lost on me until my late 20s. As a kid, I could definitely see myself laughing derisively at L'Engle explicitly stating over and over again the need to love one another, especially those who are difficult to love. As an adult, this is something I firmly believe about life, with or without any religious implications. Reading these books make me think that L'Engle and I have pondered the same things about life. I also love how she combines religion, theoretical science, and straight fantasy. We need more books that show science and religion in harmony with one another. Plus, science is just cool, and I love seeing it in kids books. It is just a really cool concept, but the execution does feel like it was meant for younger kids. I am hoping I get to read these to my son one day, and I think it will be a lot more fun that way."
242,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"It is asked again and again over the course of the narrative - ""what is real?"" I adore how my mind (all adult and unimaginative) is challenged and opened up by this book. And the vivacity and beauty of the scenes the author conjures up, as well as the glimpses of stark and terribly dark things, stay in your mind and surface when you look again at the world in which we live...A wonderful adventure story that lingers and leads you to question and think."
243,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19428076-ciara-wilkie,Rating 3 out of 5,"The sequel to A Wrinkle in Time is not what I expected. I expected more fighting the Darkness but instead we are introduced to a new villian. A lot of this book went over my head, it's much harder to imagine than the first. The concepts are more difficult. There's telepathy and a lot of talk of size and time not mattering. It didn't feel as well done as the first one. I also didn't like that they didn't mention their previous adventure at all other than meeting a cherubim before but no specifics. I hope I enjoy the 3rd novel more."
244,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32930845-becky,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book was actually quite disappointing after “A Wrinkle in Time.” It didn’t feel as deep, and the character and place and creature names were a little too awkward—they interrupted my reading and slowed things down. Plus the story itself moved relatively slowly compared to the first book. Some scenes dragged on and on...a little too close to reality to keep my interest. Not sure I’ll read the third. At least not for a while."
245,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8320288-heidi,Rating 4 out of 5,This is one weirdly trippy sequel. The final third of the book felt like experiencing a Sunday mass listening to the church choir while tripping on LSD. Still feeling that theistic vibe throughout — which got more and more overt as I progressed towards the ending. I got the impression that the younger farandolae and their rebellion against Deepening is a metaphor for today's generation abandoning organized religion… 
246,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a strange book. It has so many adventures, complicated situations and impossible things that even I can hardly explain it. It pulled me in just by its weirdness; but it is weird in an interesting way. It continues the story of the original characters (Meg, Calvin and Charles Wallace) who, along with new strange creatures that they meet, venture into Charles’s sick body. There, they have to convince some strange creatures inside his body, communicate using just the power of their minds and face the creatures that destroy the universe. The fact that Meg and Calvin had to face the most dangerous creatures in the universe and cure an unknown sickness really made me love this book. This book is perfect if you loved the first and are ready to face another whole word of complicated strangeness. "

Charles Wallace Murray, who for the young age of 6 is already a genius, but he is now very sick. His mother fears it has something to do with his mitochondria. Meg, his sister, is determined to do something about it and with the help of her friend, Calvin O’Keefe she travels inside Charles’ body to fight an evil force that may kill him. L’Engle weaves such a tale of imagination that it is hard to put down."
248,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63864557-tiffani-reads,Rating 3 out of 5,This book was underwhelming compared to the first book in the series. The whole concept of mitochondria and everything discussed in this book is not as new of a concept as it would have been when this book was published so this just felt outdated. The idea that Charles Wallace holds the fate of the universe in his DNA was even too far fetched even for me and I enjoy my fiction of the weird and unbelievable side. I’m continuing on in the series but so far the first book remains my favourite. 
249,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15825999-johanna,Rating 2 out of 5,"I did not enjoy this one as much as the first in the series. The ""naming/nothing/x-ing"" plot was just a lot and really on the nose. I know it's the allegory and it's for children, but I read a lot of children's books and just couldn't get behind it at all to enjoy it. I also found the audiobook a bit annoying - if I had to hear ""Mr. Jenkins"" or ""Charles Wallace"" one more time, I was going to scream, and the narrator for the first was much better and more engaging."

I've read it like a dozen times at least, but this time I read it as a writer, and noticed all the beautiful sentence structures, the diction, the way L'Engle SHOWS you her characters so effortlessly, using the most minimal language...it's just beautiful. And hopeful. And scary and lovely and smart. These books captured my imagination as a kid and I'm still grateful for them and learning from them today."

I read it very quickly and my comprehension was good but reading pleasure was diminished. The word were just words and the pictures painted in my mind were limited. I wish I'd had word runner in grad school though.Great book. Not as wonderful as a wrinkle in time but still good. A book of ideas of univerces within univerces within univerces.

This one doesn’t quite have the same tight pacing as the first novel- the climax feels a little strange to me. Some of the religious rhetoric is a bit more on-the-nose here as well. Don’t mind if, but I liked the subtlety of it in A Wrinkle in Time. Will commit to at least read the third book! I’ve heard this one may be the weakest of the 3, so I have high hopes!"

As an adult, rereading A Wrinkle in Time, I still enjoyed it but I definitely did not remember how religious it was. This one was interesting. Very scientific and a little religious, but it felt more subtle. I don't know how any young child reads this and understands it because even I struggled. I do really like Meg, Calvin, and Charles Wallace so next book I go."
256,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24663865-justyna,Rating 4 out of 5,"I'm still surprised how deep and wise these books get. Several quite life outlook changing conversations the characters have had are still in my memory, and I highlighted a lot of quotes. Despite (or thanks to) somewhat presently off kilter science and metaphysical aspects, a great follow up to 'Wrinkle in Time'."

258,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7873928-rebecca,Rating 3 out of 5,"For me, on the re-read this book wasn't my favorite - it got a bit bogged down with abstract concepts like ""Naming"" and telepathy-like ""kything"". But one of the strengths of the series is the cosmic scale, and the larger theme that even the smallest persons and particles have value and a purpose in the larger universe is lovely, and deep for a children's book."
259,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5488767-cassi,Rating 4 out of 5,"As CS Lewis said, “A children's story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children's story in the slightest.” This series is technically for younger readers, but it is so, so good. The writing is both intelligent and whimsical, the characters both fallible and noble, and the themes are strong and very moving. I especially loved how this one focused on the importance of being “named,” or known and loved. "
260,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5944863-janelle,Rating 5 out of 5,"I loved this story, possibly even more than A Wrinkle in Time. L’Engle’s messages of love vs hate are so beautiful. “It is only when we are fully rooted that we are really able to move.”“It is the nature of love to create, it is the nature of hate to destroy.”“Love isn’t how you feel, it’s what you do.”"

Esta continuación se sintió como un libro aparte: pese a que tiene los mismos protagonistas, pareciera que los acontecimientos del primer libro nunca pasaron. El rumbo que tomó la historia me pareció un poco infantil y L'Engle utilizó elementos clásicos de la ciencia ficción: quizá en sus años fue innovador, pero para mí no lo fueron. No estoy segura si continuaré la saga o lo dejaré aquí."

The characters were a lot of the same from the previous book with little to no evident character development which was frustrating but it was enjoyable just the same. I do want to keep with the series though as I’m curious as to where the story goes. "
263,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12634700-emma-hughes,Rating 4 out of 5,"It's like if the writers of The Magic School Bus were really into kinda experimental theology. It's fascinating. You read it and you're like ""ok what the actual heck is going on"" but then it also just invites you to admit how much you don't know and how much you're incapable of knowing, and how wonderful that is because there could be so much more to the universe than you would ever imagine. "
264,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"Overall, a good read. Makes one think about God's value of a single indivdual - Charles Wallace, or you and me. And it made me reflect on unspoken communication (kaiving, in this book). There were some Aristotelian-esque concepts of evil being nonexistent and seeking to draw others into their nothingness. Interesting world and concepts of size and transformation. Had difficulty following (or didn't follow) the location/distance analogies though. "

There were several times I found myself lost in the narrative and feeling it over my head--which was concerning considering that this is a middle grade novel.Still, L'Engle's writing remains magical and amazingly imaginative. There are great teaching points for humanity and several timeless messages of goodness, evil, and the need for improvement in the human race.I don't know where the rest of the series is going to go, but I look forward to finding out--especially since the ending of this felt a little overly cliffhangery."

The second book makes no attempt at connecting those dots. As in the last book, the concepts are very unique and cool and probably 80% of its redeeming qualities. Maybe I just don’t understand it. Maybe I’m forgetting details but it seems there are loose ends of storylines draped over the landscape that…I lost my train of thought. The cover art is 9/10. "

On the one hand, I wasn't as delighted reading this book as I was (at age 7) reading its predecessor. It felt just okay, I guess. And yet, I still care so much for these characters, and I have a great fondness for a story that can make science fiction feel like fantasy. Not to mention, I was late to work this morning because I had to finish it first. So, a solid 3/5, I guess."

Started out interesting and liked it, but once they got to like yada and mitochondria and stuff that just got so confusing. "
