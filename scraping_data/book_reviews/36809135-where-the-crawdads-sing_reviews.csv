0,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2840210-brandy-painter,Rating 1 out of 5,"Wow.Like so many people, I read this book because my book club chose it. Unlike so many people, I am not impressed. Not even a little bit. A lot of times when a book is rated this high, I tend to think it's me and not the book. But nope. This time I fully believe it's the book.This will be ranty and in the order in which things made me want to rant. No apologies. I should've known things weren't going to go well from the title alone. Crayfish are all over the place, but they don't sing in any of those places.*I definitely knew this wasn't the book for me on the very first page. I absolutely abhor overwrought prose that reads like the author sat down with the intention of writing the next Great American Novel and therefore had a certain number of adjectives and metaphors to fit on each page to prove their work was worth the accolades it was sure to get with sentences like: ""Swamp water is still and dark, having swallowed the light inits muddy throat. Even night crawlers are diurnal in this lair. There are sounds, of course, but compared to the marsh, the swamp is quiet because decomposition is cellular work. Life decays and reeks and returns to the rotted duff; a poignant wallow of death begetting life.""There is beautiful imagery, and then there is pretentious cobbling together of SAT words and figurative language so it seems deep but really isn't. For me, this was the latter. And so much of the book is just that overly flowery language barfed over every page for no reason, saying nothing or not making a lick of sense with what it does say. But it sounds pretty! So! Art!Then there was the massive eye-brow raising I did when I discovered this was taking place in North Carolina. The dialect. AGHHHHH!!!! This is why authors shouldn't use dialect when they write. You have to know a place so well in order to do that. Southern hick does not equal southern hick does not equal southern hick. There are (at the very least) five different dialects spoken in North Carolina. I attended Appalachian State University in Boone. The majority of my professors could tell which region each NC native was from by a couple sentences. I had a few who could get within two counties of where they were born after hearing them speak. Yeah. Kya's father's dialect would be exceedingly different from everyone else in their community as he is from the mountains and they are in the Outer Banks. Those are so distinctive and nothing alike. No one else in the world speaks like the Pamlico Sound people of NC. And it is rather hard to capture its cadence and brogue on page so just don't try. You will fail. (Owens totally failed.) Is that nit-picky? Maybe. But I'm more concerned with how the dialect was used. Every ""good"" person in the book overcame their dialect to learn to speak ""proper"" (ugh I hate even typing that word) English. Are you telling me Kya, who didn't have TV or radio as influence, lost her dialect with no practice and no outside influence because she was just...smart??? Good???? Same with Tate. But Chase kept his so we knew he was bad and a threat. There's some classist nonsense imbedded deep in that, and I am not here for it in any way. It's particularly annoying as it reads the way I imagine people pretend to speak when they're speaking ""southern hick"" to be mockingly superior but have never actually heard a real human in the south speak.**Then I reached the part on p57 where Kya's dad says of his family:""They had land, rich land, raised tobacco and cotton and such. Over near Asheville. Yo' gramma on my side wore bonnets big as wagon wheels and long skirts. We lived in a house wif a verandder that went a'the way around two stories high. It was fine, mighty fine.""I actually took a screenshot and sent it to my husband who was born and lived his entire life ""near Asheville"". His response, ""What in the world?"" What in the world indeed. A. No one from western NC talks like this. And Kya's father didn't move to the OBX until he was an adult, so he would still have his home dialect. Any student of language knows you don't shed and switch an accent easily once you're in adulthood. It takes practice. And even then the results are dodgy. Also this is not how Pamlico people speak anyway. See my rant about dialect above.B. Does Owens know Asheville is in the mountains??? (Tobacco was grown in the mountains though not nearly as much or as successfully as in the Piedmont. Cotton is waaaayyy harder. It gets too cold and rains too much. Also there's just not enough flat, arable land to make it worth the effort. I know there was a cotton mill in Asheville at the time, but I've never heard about people growing the cotton around there. If they were, it had to have failed more than half the time and not because of weevils. It's just not hot enough long enough. And no one was getting rich off agriculture and building plantation style houses there with slaves as was mentioned later in the book. Western NC was not like the Deep South. Because it is MOUNTAINS. Anyone who has ever driven to Asheville from the Piedmont knows exactly how mountainous. It's like flat flat flat whoa we're going UP. There's not enough flat land for plantations.) Then there was the part where Tate's mom went to ASHEVILLE for a bike because they didn't have it at the local store. Like WHAT??? She didn't try Wilmington? She drove past Greenville, Raleigh (the capitol), Durham, Chapel Hill, Greensboro, Winston-Salem, missed exits to CHARLOTTE (the largest city), to drive up a mountain for a bike? Literally no other city in NC had it? it takes SIX HOURS to drive from the Pamlico Sound to Asheville on a good traffic day in the year of our Lord 2019. Do you know how long it would've been in the 50s??? Good Grief, what is this woman's obsession with Asheville? And does she believe it is somewhere near the coast rather than on the complete opposite end of a rather long state?Which is how I knew no matter how smart she sounded or how much she might know about science and wildlife, Delia Owens didn't bother to research squat about North Carolina. Or she did and then disregarded it for whatever reason. Maybe she thought the Outer Banks and Asheville as NC's top tourist destinations were the names she needed to drop to make her book sound authentic??? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Huge parts of the novel are a giant snooze fest of nature this nature that and here's some more nature. And also grits. Because this is SOUTHERN y'all. In case it hasn't been hammered in yet.There were some freakin' awkward sexual scenes. Then there were the long drawn out court scenes that were just so tedious. I gathered from these scenes Owens is also unclear about travel times from the Greenville to the OBX. (Also I’m not sure if there ever was a Piedmont Hotel in Greenville, which is in the coastal plain and not the Piedmont. However, there IS one in Waynesville, which is also not in the Piedmont. Waynesville is in the mountains near.....guess where....Asheville.) Someone buy the woman a freakin’ map since she clearly doesn’t know what Google is. The working of the town vs Kya also bothered me. It's like Owens knows that the OBX people are a difficult community to become a part of without truly understanding the whys and hows of it all. Kya's character development was just so frustrating overall. And some of the stuff she accomplishes requires a tremendous suspension of disbelief. Owens definitely wanted the reader to see her a certain way. She is a manic pixie dream girl in a marsh until suddenly she isn't... I was SO MAD about that. Because I hate when men write manic pixie dream girls. But when women do it? I'm enraged. Way to take it to your own gender. Then it turns out Kya should have a shirt that reads, NOT YOUR MANIC PIXIE DREAM GIRL in fluorescent letters. When I got to the end, I was so angry. Because the Kya we got a glimpse of those last couple of pages, WHER THE HECK WAS SHE THE ENTIRE BOOK? I want to read a book about that complicated, brilliant girl and recognize her as such through the whole thing. Ugh. Give me the Kya who can cold-bloodedly commit a well thought out murder, convince a jury she didn't, make a good portion of the community feel guilty for even suspecting her in the first place, and live a happily contented life forever after. It would have been way more interesting than what came up to that point. I FEEL SO CHEATED. And you know it's just because Owens wanted the element of surprise. But it wasn't really THAT surprising. Why wasn't I allowed to appreciate Kya for the vengeful goddess she was in planning that and executing it beautifully. Don't give me this knowledge with no insight AFTER SHE'S DEAD. Let me SEE ALL OF THAT. And finally rant-wise, Owens doesn't seem to know quite what she wants this book to be. Is it an ode to nature? Is it a crime novel? Is it literary fiction? It's kind of like she wanted to write the crime novel but genre writing is too plebeian, so here comes the overwrought language and navel gazing. Because ART. The nature part was her falling back on what she was comfortable with I think. *Crayfish do, I learned from my research, make a noise but we don't often hear it as they can make it underwater as well as out of water. It sounds like tap dancing. No singing even remotely flirted with. Where the Crawdads Tap Dance doesn't have the same ring I guess. And also doesn't narrow things down geographically. I did wonder why it wasn't called Where the Cicadas Sing. Because those sing. And are on a 17 year cycle. Which would have fit PERFECTLY with the timeline of the book. So color me confused. I know NC can be overrun with cicadas, but I'm not sure if the Pamlico region has them or not. Still would have made more sense than the actual title. (Again, it sounds flowery and important. Doesn't mean it has depth or meaning.)**My husband decided at age 13 to get rid of his accent. He worked long and hard at it. He did it by listening to network TV anchors and copying their speech patterns. It took years of concentrated effort. It's still not completely gone though he can pass for not being southern in other parts of the country. And when he's home? It comes back full force with all its dialectic eccentricities. I've lived the majority of my life in the Southern Appalachian mountains. Everyone here still knows I'm an outsider the second I open my mouth despite the fact my midwestern relatives swear up and down I have an accent now. And people here in eastern Tennessee are uncertain about my husband because he sounds kind of like them but not quite. (He's let his accent come back more since settling here because it helps with the not being considered an outsider. That's as important in southern Appalachia as it is in the OBX if you want to be embraced by the community.) But a single gorge changed the dialect between eastern TN Appalachian and western NC Appalachian just enough natives here recognize his accent as being not quite theirs. BY THE WAY my husband was just as smart after training out his accent as he was when he had it at its thickest. He knew he needed it gone to be a journalist, so he got rid of it. He was literally asked to ""speak southern"" by people in Michigan when we lived there briefly more than once so they could laugh about it. Which is f***ed up. Southerners speak the way they do for cultural and geographical reasons and it has nothing to do with the amount of intelligence or righteousness they have."
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5149179-betsy-robinson,Rating 1 out of 5,"9/8/20 note: Dear Goodreaders, If you loved this book, I'm very happy for you. As a reader and also somebody who works in the publishing industry, I want all readers to like or love as many books as possible, so the fact that you love this book is, in my opinion, a good thing. If reading a review that does not agree with your opinion enrages you, don't read this review. I do not believe there are spoilers in my opinion, but a couple of commenters think there are. So if you have not yet read this book, you may not want to read my review. I read it quite a while ago and have moved on to many more books that I'm more interested in. So I won't be joining conversation in the comments. If you disliked this book, you may enjoy having some company in your opinion. --Betsy RobinsonThe Review (November 18, 2018)Normally I would not finish let alone review a book I disliked as much as I did this one, but since I bought the book and am reading it for my book club, I’ve decided to say what I think:I found the writing of this romance/murder mystery to be painfully split—almost as if there were two different authors: an experienced one for the vivid narrative and an amateur for dialogue and character development (which in fact may be the case, since the author’s an experienced nature writer and this is her first novel).The story is told in two time periods: Young Kya, left alone in the marsh to fend for herself, starts the story in 1952; and police investigate a murder in 1969. The opening lyrical descriptions of the swampland and inner thoughts of the swamp kids had soul—I loved, felt, and smelled the land, sea, air, and dense plants. But when people started talking, the writing became stilted, overwritten, and unbelievable. This happened in the earlier time period with Kya and a boy and the boy and his dad, and same thing with the 1969 police dialogue. The kids’ scenes had an after-school TV special sound and the police scenes sounded canned, like a marshlands-of-North Carolina version of Law and Order, where exposition is awkwardly inserted to move the story forward or there is overwriting that takes away from what could have sounded more authentic to the region. For example, a deputy says to his sheriff:“I’m hungry. Let’s go by the diner on the way out there.” “Well, get ready for an ambush. Everybody in town’s pretty riled up. Chase Andrew’s murder’s the biggest thing’s happened ’round here, maybe ever. Gossip’s goin’ up like smoke signals.”“Well, keep an ear out. We might pick up a tidbit or two. Most ne’er-do-wells can’t keep their mouths shut.”(61)Why not just, “I’m hungry,” and cut to the wonderful description of the Barkley Cove Diner and the scene of people gossiping about the crime? In real life, people do not say everything they’re thinking or narrate everything that’s happening or is going to happen. In fact, most of us lie about what we really think—if we are even self-aware enough to know our subconscious thoughts. Leaving out thoughts, leaving gaps in truth, and trusting the characters a writer has created allows subtext and real character to drive things forward. There is none of that here.I found the character development absurd: Simply put, there are no authentic, complex characters. Kya starts as a believable swamp rat, which is inconsistent with what we learn about the derivation of her parents. Her voice is unbelievably inconsistent throughout the book. Then there are the two one-dimensional romances, one of which allows her to learn to read at age 14 and grow into an educated, sophisticated, poetry-reciting biologist, knowing lyrics to songs she never would have heard, etc., and the other, a sexual relationship where she doesn’t even think about getting pregnant although she seems to have learned all her biology from the esoteric scientific texts she reads.I finished this book by skimming large sections, starting at page 164 when the entire plot became apparent, sans an end-of-book twist which was intellectually fun, but just as unbelievable as the manipulations of Kya’s character. Sorry, friends who adore this book, I’m an outlier on this one, I guess."
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22227336-susan-stuber,Rating 1 out of 5,"Seeing as to how I skipped most of the second half of the book, I have no choice but to give it one star.There are so many things wrong with it, I hardly know where to start. The only thing it really had going for it was the plot, which was definitely a good one, and it is too bad that it got wrecked. I am at a loss to put this book into any kind of genre. Romance? YA? Courtroom drama? Murder mystery? I rather suspect that the author had the idea, first and foremost, to weave a story around how human behavior imitates that of wildlife, was fascinated by the marsh area of NC and fashioned a story around this. As a result the book neither flies nor swims. We might, on one page, get a lot of scientific information about insects, birds and plants, then we are back to the romance style of “her cheeks burned,” “her groin throbbed as if all her blood had surged there.” “her long hair trailing in the wind” and “he reached out and ran his fingers across her firm breasts.” Did I mention that she had black hair and red lips? And that she spontaneously recites poetry out loud on the beach?Some books have unlikely coincidences, some have downright contrived ones and others have those that are highly unlikely and therefore plain unbelievable. In the first and second cases, a book can still make it if the characterisations, settings and plot are well done. In the third case, unless you are talking about a fairy tale, you have to be either really romantically minded or you just go along with whatever for the sake of entertainment. “Crawdads” falls into the third category.It is rather unbelievable that, even with an abusive and alcoholic father, the rest of the family would simply abandon their six-year old daughter and sister, unless they were totally depraved, which the author portrays them as not. It is unbelievable that not one single adult in the nearby town would know that the girl was in the marsh by herself and thus make some effort to help her. I will put the rest of the “unbelievables” at the bottom in a spoiler alert. Aside from them, there are the errors and other annoying facets.Such as the author’s use of the vernacular, but only for the bad folks. The good folks all speak proper English. Such as the author’s fascination with southern food, especially grits, black-eyed peas and turnip greens, which are mentioned ad-nauseum.Spoiler alert: Unbelievable that the girl, who did not learn to read until age 14, would then go on to become a self-educated scientist and artist and even write several books, all while being entirely on her own in the wilds. It is unbelievable, since she wasn’t that far from town, that she would never seek out any contact with anyone besides her two suitors and an old black couple. Especially since she was a “looker” and wore white cut-off jeans (really??) when she went to town to buy groceries. How could everyone be so mean to her unless she was plain weird (which we are assured she was not). No, it was that all the town’s people were just narrow-minded and mean…except for of course the one golden boy with the golden locks."
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5032725-debra,Rating 5 out of 5,"All the Stars!!!!!Can I just say that I loved everything about this book and leave it at that!?!Where the Crawdads Sing is a story of resiliency, survival, hope, love, loss, loneliness, desperation, prejudice, determination and strength. This book goes back and forth in time to tell the story of Kya Clark a.k.a. the Marsh girl. She lives on the outskirts of town, in the Marsh, and the locals look down their noses at her, she is judged, ridiculed and bullied. But there are those who show her kindness, friendship, and show her love. Oh, how I loved this book!Kya was a young girl when her Mother walked away without looking back. Soon, all her siblings followed suit, leaving Kya alone with her often absent, drunk, and abusive father. She is left to care for their home, to cook, clean and take care of both of their needs. How her situation pulled on my heartstrings. She had to learn to shop, to cook and to provide food for herself in her father's absence. All while dealing with loneliness, feelings of abandonment and loss. Always wondering when and if her Mother will ever return. She was a smart and clever girl who knew the marsh and found ways to make money and provide for her basic needs. Soon 'Jumpin and his wife, Mable, show her kindness, generosity and love. I dare you not to adore this couple!As Kya grows and learns more about life through her interactions with the creatures of the Marsh, two young men enter her life. One is her brother's older friend, Tate, who teaches her to read and shows her acceptance and happiness. Another brings her hope of a future but won’t introduce her to his friends and family. Could one be her chance at happiness? A chance at belonging? A chance at being accepted? A chance at being loved? A Chance for growth? Or will history repeat itself?In 1969, local football legend, Chase Andrews is found dead. Rumors swirl as to motive and possible suspects. Rumors have been circulating for years about Chase and his involvement with the Marsh girl. Could she be his killer? What motive could she have?This book had a little bit of everything that I love: a likeable main character who pulls at your heartstrings, murder mystery, atmosphere, drama, coming of age, and romance. There are several characters who give and show kindness including, Tate, the cashier who gives back too much change and the couple who make sure Kya has what she needs. What is the saying? Those that have the least to give, give the most! There is a police investigation and court room drama and some twists and turns I did not see coming.This book is beautifully written and contains poetry and vivid descriptions of the Marsh. I highly recommend this book! It's thoughtful, evokes emotion, and transports the reader back in time to the Marsh. I loved every page. Read more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com"
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4971692-kristin-kc,Rating 5 out of 5,"*5 Stars, easily!*WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING is a gentle yet symbolic depiction of the valiant survival of Kya Clark—a reclusive young girl who has been abandoned by her parents, siblings, school system, the entire town surrounding her, and what ultimately feels like life itself. Mother Nature has quite literally become Kya’s caretaker, and deep in a lonely Marsh along the North Carolina coast is where Kya will not only hide, but blossom into a primal independent being, coaxed inside the embrace of an indiscriminate wilderness as she embodies its uninhibited spirit. Until a boy from “yonder” befriends Kya, and her lonely existence is shaken straight to its solemn core. Add to that the curious unsolved murder of the town’s local “Golden Boy”, and all that’s left to say is game-on. Although this story delivers one hell of a powerful punch, it is sculpted with a humble hand; a delicate wind that keeps building and building until it ends up emphatically blowing your mind. The writing. Is. Beautiful. Prose so unique and so breathtaking that a single description of a firefly suddenly grows so intimate and probing, and I might have gotten something in my eye—*sniff*. Here you’ll find sentences that read like poetry, with a lyrical rhythm that sways the reader like the gentle rocking of a boat. Yet it is not showy nor over-the-top --- but pretty perfect. Owens doesn't tell us what to think, but alludes to each message through writing so alive you can almost hear it breathing. She carries us through her dense, atmospheric tone and persuades us to seek and find; discover and examine, all on our own. She allows her striking imagery to guide us as the marsh has guided Kya, and I felt as though I could smell the sea and taste the sweetness of new love. Kya’s journey spans years, the reader present from her childhood into maturity. I love this story’s ode to wilderness and Mother Earth with her instinctual need to nurture and protect. I love each character’s flawed nature as well as those redeemed. I love the heart and soul that saturates every inch of this story, and more than anything, I LOVE that spectacularly bold ending! To the reader who appreciates nature’s effortless beauty honored in fiction; to those who seek a love story every bit true as it is tender; to the one who needs a tantalizing murder/mystery to spice things up, and for those who tend to root for the underdog in hopes she’ll someday sparkle like the gem she is—this one’s for you.

5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,Rating 3 out of 5,"Phew, I finally made it through this book! My apologies to everyone who loved this, but unfortunately, I did not, and no one's sadder than me.Reading Where the Crawdads Sing was like stepping back in time to high school, when class-assigned books meant lots of award-winning fiction. Sure, there were plenty of literary merit found in these pages, but little joy was actually experienced from reading them.Starting at the age of six, Kya was slowly abandoned by everyone in her family, until she was the sole person left living in a little shack at the edge of town. As the years went by, shunned by the entire town, she slowly became known as the ""Marsh Girl,"" a wild and lonely creature that few knew and most feared. This is her story. And when the town's golden boy dies, old prejudices flair up, and Kya finds herself at the receiving end of the town's anger and suspicion.This story is descriptive prose at its most verbose, and no detail—the marsh, waterways, bugs, trees, animals, and sea shells—was too small to be included. But the story has little plot and even less character development. Especially in the beginning, when Kya didn't talk to or interact with a single person, the monotony of the writing almost did me in.The other big issue is that the story is pretty hard to believe. We're supposed to accept that Kya is able to fend for herself, which includes cooking, cleaning, going to the store, buying things, and coming up with ways to make money, all at the age of six. That is way beyond the realm of possibility, let alone probability. There's only so far my beliefs can be suspended, I tell you.That's not to say I didn't enjoy a single thing here because I did. I found the middle of the book to be the most engaging. That was when Kya started interacting with others and the writing became a little bit more interesting as a result. Tate and Jumpin' were my favorite characters, and every scene they were in grabbed me. But the juxtaposition of their scenes (alive and compelling) against the ones without them (descriptive and unchanging) made the latter feel even more dull and plodding by comparison.In the end, this book just isn't for me. Everything that others loved are all the same things I didn't. I prefer my books to have interesting plot advancement, nuanced character growth, and zippy writing, none of which this book had. Instead, the plot is straightforward, the characters all remain stubbornly the same throughout, and the writing is long-winded enough to deflate even the most enthusiastic of readers.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧"
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury,Rating 2 out of 5,"All of you talked me into reading this book. The Goodreads reviews were virtually unanimously good, not just good, great. It had to be good, I thought. And because I needed an extra audiobook I bought it on Libro.fm and locked myself into reading it. Bad decision.This book is just a pile of tropes and cliches dressed up in some nice nature writing. The plot is not much of a plot and the mystery makes up only a small section of the book, and much of it ends up being courtroom scenes and not much mystery. This book is basically Manic Pixie Dream Girl In the Marsh. We spend a long time with young Kya, abandoned, fending for herself, almost entirely isolated. I was willing to be patient through all that, to see what kind of person she would grow into because that had the potential to be very interesting.Except it was not. It became less interesting the longer I read. Because Kya doesn't act like a person who has been almost entirely isolated. She just acts like a regular loner. Sure, she may have some habits that fit with her strange upbringing, but she seems to understand people and language just like a regular person. I was nearly out of my head with frustration that the book had spent so long telling me how different she was only to have her be just the same as most people. (Deciding to never love again because everyone leaves you is a pretty regular-person thing to do when you're in your 20's, for example.)This isn't a book of deep psychological insight. You can probably guess from a couple of chapters in how it will end. (And you would be right!) There are no real revelations, the plot is pretty obvious ahead of time. And it's all rather confusing because there are sections where Owens writes well, her courtroom scenes are actually quite competent, but on both the broad strokes and the specific details nothing here really rings true. And the more time that passed the more I got annoyed with this book so it finally fell from 3-stars to a rare 2-star review. (I usually quit a 2-star book.) If you're going to give me a plot I've seen a thousand times, at least wrap it in some keen insight or character development. But sadly this was a failure for me all around."
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5512657-sara,Rating 2 out of 5,"I seem to be finding myself in the minority a lot these days. The first half of this book was pretty close to marvelous, and then it went south on me (that is a pun). Anyway, after my attempt at weak humor, let me resume in a serious note to say I was expecting so much more than I got here.Kya is a mere ten years old in 1952 when she is deserted, albeit gradually, by all the members of her family and left to make it alone in the marsh country of North Carolina. She forms a real attachment and understanding of her environment, which would be a necessity to survive in such a place, and she mostly works that to her advantage. When a young man who was once a friend of her brother finds her alone and begins to offer some help and company, she learns to read and her life begins to take a turn toward something more than isolation and running barefoot through the woods.That part of the story was interesting to me. I was interested in how she would survive, whether she would connect with the outside world, and of course how she would tie into the parallel story of the 1969 murder of a young man from the neighboring town. Then, in what seemed an abrupt change of tone, the story devolved into what I would deem chick lit. The plot became shallow and the author seemed to me to have lost the thread of her story and veered into another realm.I am sorry this didn’t work for me. I wanted it to, indeed I thought it was going to. Perhaps it is me. Since it is a group read, I am anxious to see what the other members of the group saw that perhaps I did not.I had originally rated this a 3-star read, but after reflection I find that I strongly feel it was only ""OK"" and therefore I have revised the rating to 2-stars. I think I felt shy of giving it only 2 when so many of my respected friends had given it 5...but truth should prevail."
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb,Rating 2 out of 5,"You know that person? The one who doesn't like what everyone else seems to love? There has to be someone in the outlier club and this time it is me. I was highly anticipating this book after reading all the praise from readers whose tastes usually align with my own. Unfortunately, I should have DNF'd this one when very early in the book, my eyes glazed over and I began skimming pages and pages of descriptive writing. The author is a nature writer and those sections were undoubtably well-written. But I don’t care for overly descriptive writing. And then there's poetry. I skipped over those as well. Everything other reviewers say they enjoyed were things I intensely disliked. I struggled with believability. I won't list them all, but the implausibility of every single plot point was something I couldn’t get past. To make things worse, romance is not a genre I enjoy and the romance in this book had a very YA feel to it. Finally, I found the use of dialect distracting to read and often in the same paragraph a character would switch from local dialect to proper English.Sometimes my love of the story or the strength of the writing is enough for me to ignore implausibility and move past a few things I don't like. This wasn't one of those times.Recommended for readers who enjoy long, descriptive nature writing, and those who have no trouble suspending disbelief. If I had known these things before starting this book I would have skipped it, so perhaps my review will help other readers like me.* Thanks to Edelweiss for a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review"

I’m sorry. I do realise with those numbers it is definitely me. I read all of Part 1 and the first chapter of Part 2, then I gave up at page 156. Nothing seemed to be happening other than Kya fishing and cooking grits. There are lots of pretty nature metaphors like:
Waves slammed one another, awash in their own white saliva, breaking apart on the shore with loud booms— energy searching for a beachhead. Then they flattened into quiet tongues of foam, waiting for the next surge.
But I just don’t enjoy descriptions of trees, swamps and bugs that much. It's funny. Usually when a book doesn't float my boat, I can still totally understand the hype. I wouldn't have called this one, though, I must admit. Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"

This book exceeded my already high expectations; it emanates a quiet power, a slow drawing in and connection of reader to book, one that I found myself able to get lost in due to the lush atmosphere and the depth of emotion. I can see now why this book is getting so much attention, and am thrilled to see that for once the hype train was right on track. "

15,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 stars rounded up .A story of survival, of what the depth of loneliness feels like when a young girl is abandoned first by her mother, then her four siblings. Even at five Kya understands why they left - because of her father, because of his meanness, his abuse, his drinking. What she doesn’t understand is why they left her behind and neither could I. She remains pretty much alone since her father comes and goes until he doesn’t come back. It was gutting as she sits on the beach with the gulls not wanting them to fly away and leave her too. Heartbreaking how she is neglected and abandoned, remembering the beatings, trying to figure out a way to eat. Atmospheric is an understatement, and I don’t use that word often because it seems overused sometimes but this place, the marsh permeates just about everything that is meaningful in this story beginning with Kya’s realization “And the marsh became her mother.” The marsh becomes her life, her livelihood, the essence of who she becomes through her self learned expertise of the insects and the birds, her art. But is it enough to heal her? The kind hearts of Jumpin’ and Mabel who help a little girl alone and in need, the only human contact she has until her brother’s friend Tate comes into her life, but is that enough to help her heal ? I love the writing, fabulous descriptions of the marsh. The marsh and its inhabitants, the insects, the fish, the birds which pique Kya’s curiosity, give her so much joy and company, and allow her to become the expert she does become on the marsh and marsh life. But is that enough to make Kya whole after so much hurt and loneliness?There’s a murder mystery, not my usual fare, but I was totally engaged, trying to come up with who the murderer was, totally engaged in the courtroom scenes. I gave it 4.5 stars because there were a couple of things that felt not quite realistic. But when I woke up thinking about this story, I knew I would round it up to 5 stars . I don’t often cry over books, but this one definitely brought me to tears at a number of places. Overall it was such a fabulous read, heartbreaking in so many ways, with wonderful writing and characters, a stunning portrait of a place, of the trauma of loss and loneliness. My heart was always broken for Kya, a character to remember. An unforgettable ending. This was a monthly read with Esil and Diane and as always I appreciate their thoughts as we read together. In this case, we have very similar feelings about this beautiful story.I received an advanced copy of this book from G.P. Putnam’s Sons through Edelweiss. "

The author who is well versed in non-fiction and has a strong background in nature has beautiful prose and really captures the essence of nature in her writing. Over the course of her life, Kya forms certain connections particularly with two young men from town. When Chase Andrews, a young man from town, is found dead, Kya is a suspect. Did she do it? What happened? This book goes into so many different topics: class, how you can really ""help"" someone, judging someone else, what real love is, what family is, the beauty of relationships and connection. In many ways, this book is relatable. Most people have felt like an outsider at some point in their lives. In this book, Kya was very lucky to find some people who actually cared about her. Also, the author talks about this fear that Kya felt. This is normal. Women are normally afraid unfortunately. Always looking over our shoulder. Always told to not go out at night. Always travel with someone. If anything, I think this book is a good reminder that some things haven't changed in 50 years. Women are still beat by men, and even if they do go through the law, it does not always work out. This book.....Wow! It definitely deserved all of the buzz. That being said, I did NOT like the last 2 pages of the book. I thought that the ending should have been more open.2024 Reading Schedule	Jan	MiddlemarchFeb	The Grapes of WrathMar	Oliver TwistApr	Madame BovaryMay	A Clockwork OrangeJun	PossessionJul	The Folk of the Faraway Tree CollectionAug	Crime and PunishmentSep	Heart of DarknessOct	Moby-DickNov	Far From the Madding CrowdDec	A Tale of Two CitiesConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta"

Starts out OK though from the beginning you have to suspend logic to go along with the plot; by midpoint it falls apart into a series of cliched, trite, unsupported, silly plot points. The character development, so-called, is frankly unbelievable and downright ridiculous. I’m giving it an extra star because in the age of Trump I’m trying to be kinder in general.No. Just no."

Why? because this was a wonderful tale that had everything; from the imagery, sentiment, character appeal, and themes that were interwoven into a story so perfectly that nothing appeared overworked but all of it caught me in 'the feelers'. But most of all it had a child's / woman's determination at the centre of the story. My heart was invested. Is it a stunning piece of literature, well no it is not? Is the writing style to everyone’s taste, well no to that as well? I can empathise with readers who could not connect with the dialogue particularly at the beginning. I could not get my tongue around some of the slang in the opening chapters but then it softens as the book progresses. Was it plausible for a young girl to live in the marshes – perhaps no to that as well?However, could I connect with a story of hardship, isolation, courage, endurance, and overcoming prejudices, then yes, I could. I love the stories of drive, strength, accomplishment and determination, despite the odds, and this book has it in abundance. A beautiful story told with so much heart.The PlotKya is a Marsh girl, deserted by her mother and left to a drunk and violent father, who eventually abandons her along with all her other siblings. She was not school educated, and so she begins to learn her lessons in life through nature, the wildness surrounding her and with a little help from her friend Tate. Possessing an irrepressibly curious mind Kya finds a dizzying array of new ways to live and learn through nature, she learns to love and cope with disappointment. She learns trade, life skills, and even to read and write but above all she learns to depend only on herself.What is beautiful about this story is the journey of Kya into adulthood as she learns to trust only to be disappointed, but the coming of age was handled with such delicacy and sensitivity that I can only applaud the author. I loved that Kya was not someone who would indulge in the softer emotions of self-pity and disappointment but accepted her earlier demise and went about changing it. At the end of the book we see the poor 'marsh girl' replaced with something wonderfully unique but still true to her inner values. A girl who did not need to wear fancy dresses and depend on social acceptance to define her - because it was the torn clothes, years of rejection, isolation, and abuse that she would go on to wear as badges of courage and of survival.The sensory descriptions, the beautifully described landscape, the character development through the book and the storyline made this a 5-star read for me. The simplicity of this story was its beauty, Kay’s isolation and growth was its crowning glory and so the Crawdad's Sing!!!!"
22,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew,Rating 4 out of 5,"At the time of reading, this book seems to be the most hyped book in my Goodreads feed. Not a minute goes by without a review or update from this book popping up. If you know me, you know that no matter the type of book or the subject matter, if it is hyped I want to give it a go. With that in mind, when I started this, the only thing I knew about it was its hype – I knew zero about the story, genre, type of book, etc. I just had a cover and a title!Did it live up to the hype?I think it did. I was entertained by the story and found it very easy to follow. It was a bit of historical fiction with some mystery involved eventually rounding off with a little courtroom drama. One of my favorite phrases to use when applicable is that “heart-strings were pulled”, and there was definitely some of that happening here. I think if you like a good, well-told story you will like this one. Who do I recommend it to?Historical fiction fans for sure. Especially those interested in mid-20th Century American fiction. Issues of race and public perception at that time are key to the plot.I am not sure there was enough mystery/courtroom drama to interest fans of those genres if that is specifically what you are looking for. But, there is enough if you just need to satiate a small hunger.Also, while only a little steamy at times, I think fans of stories with some romance will enjoy this one. Again, if you need a lot of hot a heavy in your romance, you will not find it here, but the relationships in the story should be of interest.Should you read it?I feel like this story has a little of a bunch of genres and not too much of any. Because of this, I think it will appeal to a wide audience. So, if you have seen the hype in your feed, too, and have been wondering, I think you should try it out. You may not be blown away, but I don’t think you will be disappointed."

There are some who can live without wild things, and some who cannot.
Kya Clark -
 the Marsh Girl 
- led a lonely life.Her mother left her, her siblings left her, her father went out and never came home. The townspeople abhorred her and left her well-alone. But when you are only a child yourself, how do you survive?
Kya laid her hand upon the breathing, wet earth, and the marsh became her mother.
And so Kya learns to love and live by herself. 
Most of what she knew, she'd learned from the wild. Nature had nurtured, tutored, and protected her when no one else would.
And as she grew, so did her curiosity. 
She could read anything now, he said, and once you can read anything you can learn everything. It was up to her.
Since she could read and write, and she had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, she did the only logical thing - she taught herself. 
I wasn't aware that words could hold so much. I didn't know a sentence could be so full. 
But then, Chase Andrews, winds up dead. Kya Clark, now an adult, is the prime suspect.Just when her life was finally picking up, it goes to pieces.Whew. Guys. Girls. People of all ages.This one was STUNNING. Like absolutely *stunning*. I don't even know where to begin - there was so much to love about this book.The setting was absolutely magical - every time we talked about the swamp and the life within it, I was absolutely riveted to the book. Kya was such a gorgeous main character - I felt for her so much and I wanted to just wrap her up in a hug the whole time. Kya's first love was so beautifully done - I literally had the hug-the-book-to-yourself-and-squeal moment when they found each other.I also have now developed an addition to nature-themed books thanks to this gorgeous one.In short - there's a LOT to love about this book and you NEED to read it as soon as possible.This one was absolutely stunning.

24,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5463364-david-putnam,Rating 4 out of 5,"This starts out as a wonderful book well worth a five-start rating. The voice of the coming of age Kya is truly amazing. Had the craft been sustained through to the end of the book this could have easily been compared to, To Kill a Mocking Bird.The setting is marvelous and carries the same weight as a main character. Absolutely wonderful descriptions.The author does a magnificent job creating the character of Kya, with details that make her come alive on the page. This book would have worked fine just as a coming of age novel minus the mystery of the murder.The insertion of the secondary plotline is disruptive and breaks the flow of the story. Part of the problem is the dramatic shift in voice from Kya to the sheriff. Kya is handled masterfully, the sheriff, not so much. These disruptive scenes are kept short but they are still speed bumps that urged me to put the book down. The author is a wonderful craftsman. At about page 150 the author wanted to emphasize one part of a scene and shifted from past tense to present tense just for a few paragraphs. The transition and its impact were wonderful, and done so well it was practically invisible.The story is character driven which is my favorite kind of book, however when handling the mystery part of the story, the protagonist doesn’t dig up the clue. Two different witnesses at two different times, and long after the crime has occurred, comes forward and says, “Oh, I might have seen something that night. I just didn’t think it was important.” For me this too is a minor distraction but it could have easily been avoided. The character voice matures as the character gets older and is real and believable. This is difficult to do and the way it is done here is truly an art form.I all but put the book down three quarters of the way through when the murder case was described. I just couldn’t buy it. The quick alternating scenes in that last quarter of the book, the jail and court scenes too often disrupted the fictive dream and tossed me out of the story. There is a definite tone change that comes from a shift in the craft. The voice is lost with the shifting from character to character, too many points of view. And the use of cliché’s like “I walked into a door,” and “I jus’ didn’t fall off a turnip truck.” didn’t match the wonderful craft in the first three quarters of the book. It almost feels as if the ending had not been planned, or more likely was rushed.The ending was predictable because of the way the protagonist pov was handled (or avoided), and that there really wasn’t any other possibility, no red herrings to choose from so it left only one possible outcome. There wasn’t twist at the end. I wasn’t surprised at all. So reluctantly I have to give this one four stars instead of a five plus.David Putnam author of the Bruno Johnson series"

26,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s,Rating 5 out of 5,"MEMORABLE CHARACTERS AND MEMORABLE STORY. For me to rate a book five stars it has to give me something bout of the ordinary, make me feel. Most of all it has to be a book or contain a character or characters that I won't forget. Above all it has to make me feel. This book did all three. Kya, aka Catherine Clark, the Marsh girl is an unforgettable character, abandoned by her mother at she six, her siblings shortly after. By ten she was alone in the Marsh raising herself, her main source of comfort the natural life found in the North Carolina Marsh, the gulls she fed daily. She learned not to trust nor depend on anyone but herself. She was smart, curious, feArless and so lonely. As if this character wasn't enough to remember, there are also some supporting characters that play an integral part in her life. Jumpin and Mabel, a black couple that try to help Kya in whatever way she will accept. Tate, who has known her since she was small, teaches her to read anc much more. What will one do in the face of such loneliness? How much will they sacrifice if they reach out, trust? Prejudice is a big theme, because as the Marsh girl she is considered illiterate, unclean, and none in the village reach out to help. There is of course a villian, who claims to love her, but marries another, breaking her heart . This is there another thread comes in, a story told in alternate chapters, as when he is murdered , she is accused. Also where another wonderful character comes in, a man, 74 years old, a retired lawyer who comes out of retirement to defend her against a town that already assumes she is guilty.I could nitpick a few things, but I won't. I loved and learned much about the natural world, a different way of looking at things. On walks I take along the river I will look at things I ordinarily wouldn't. A survival story, what Kya has to do it not easy, but since she has little choice it is what she does. Making the most of what one has, regardless of how little. More than one I had tears running down my face, so this gets five, big marshmallow stars from this reader.This was mine, Angela and Esils August read, and as always our reads and discussions are something in which I look forward.ARC from Edelweiss."

Kya  has my heart, she is such a vibrant and strong character. Her struggles with life kind of resonated in some places. The way she took care of herself with no one around and even when people came and betrayed her trust, she never lost herself. She made mistakes, but she learned. Chase was honestly, the worst thing to happen. Tate although imperfect was better than Chase. These two guys make and break Kya but I never really cared about the guys as much as I did for her. I didn't particularly care for the romance as I did for the character development.  Sure, there were some sweet moments but wasn't really impactful for me. I liked Jumpin' and Mabel wayyyyy more. The marsh descriptions were vivid and well written. I was fully immersed in it tbh and didn't really want to put this book down. The legal aspect was interesting to read. I knew how it all ends and I still found it to be satisfying.  Highly recommended  if you're looking for a story that revolves around a character and her journey. It's a coming of age story with murder mystery aspect.  ⚠️TW- Domestic abuse, child abandonment, abuse and neglect, bullying, racism, socioeconomic discrimination, and attempted rape.  ~•~•~Have I seen the movie?

And the story! How can your heart not help but ache for Kya? First her mother leaves, then her siblings, even her ne’er do well father. Left to her own devices by the entire town, she survives without schooling or any aid. The preacher’s wife calls her white trash and hurries her child away from Kya convinced she carries disease. The marsh is a character in its own right. Owens does a magnificent job describing it so that we feel we are there, seeing every plant, bird and insect along with Kya. Owens paints the surroundings just like Kya paints, with a fine brush intent on getting every detail right. There are so many heartbreaking moments in this book. Kya just can’t understand why everyone leaves her. The murder mystery was very well done and I had no clue how it would play out. The suspense was killing me. So, this is my first five star book of 2019. It has everything - beautiful writing, great characters and suspense. Highly recommend it!"
29,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie,Rating 4 out of 5,"Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens is a 2018 G.P. Putnam's Sons publication. One part mystery, one part legal drama, one part coming of age story, and one part love story- equals a full heartrending poignant tale that will leave you gasping for air. Barkley Cove, North Carolina- 1969Kya Clark- aka- “The Marsh Girl’ has been abandoned, one by one, by every single person in her life. She lives by the seat of her pants, in a shack, eluding everyone, except a friend of her brother’s named, Tate. Tate watches out for Kya, when he’s able, and teaches her to read, among other things. As time moves on, however, despite a deepening affection for Kya, Tate knows he'll have to leave, and go away to college. While he's away, the myth of ‘The Marsh Girl’ will solidify forevermore. Kya will face a challenge like no other, and her fate will rest in the hands of the residents of Barkley Cove, with folks who have taunted her, shunned her, and judged her, her entire life.In 2016-17, there were several stellar novels written, which centered around children or teens raised in a turbulent, ‘off the grid’ environment, living in harsh conditions and under the care of an unreliable, or unstable father. While they were all quite compelling and effective, I wasn’t sure I wanted to tackle another one with a similar theme. Yet, with more and more high praise pouring in and one stellar review after another posted by readers, I began to regret my decision to pass on this one. So, obviously, I succumbed, and checked it out of the library. I never doubted the book would be a good one, I just didn’t know if I had the emotional strength right at this moment to tackle the topics of abuse and neglect. But as it turns out, this story isn’t really about the escape from an unconventional upbringing, or about the harsh survivalist or endurance skills needed to cope with an unforgiving landscape, as I had originally thought. While the story certainly drives home the cause and effects of abandonment and the cycles of domestic abuse and violence, this is also a very tender coming of age tale, a story of survival, but also a story of real friendship, true love, and what it means to truly feel free. Kya suffers a great deal of heartbreak, even from unexpected sources, but seems to have resigned herself to a way of life she believes is really her only true option. But, all of it is threatened when a body is found in the marsh, and Kya’s life is suddenly under a white-hot spotlight. The author does a fantastic job with the ecological descriptions and drawing the reader into the beauty Kya sees in her environment. The rich characterizations, especially with Kya’s character study, is another area in which the book excels. There are layers of thought -provoking topics, and a stunning revelation that knocked my breath out, but for those who are sticklers for realistic fiction, this one stretches the boundaries of plausibility in many places. However, you should allow yourself to go along with it, because that is part of the beauty of fiction, and it is well worth any required suspension of belief. Ultimately, I was exceedingly glad I gave this book a try. It was everything I knew it would be, but it was a lot more than I anticipated. As a fan of courtroom drama, I enjoyed the trial scenes, and the mystery elements, but of course it is Kya who stole my heart and made me feel envious for to the kind of freedom and way of life she willingly sacrificed so much to maintain. 4 stars"

I plan to buy the physical book, too. I want to re-read many of the sentences - see them in written book form...and own a book by Delia Owens. She’s a one-of-a-kind-author!!!This book could easily become a modern classic!  The prose is so outstanding — gorgeous—that the smells and visuals of the wildlife — made me feel as if I was there too.  — a world with no walls—birds, nests, water, shells, mussels, grasses, trees, — — the *marshlands* - becomes a living character in this story. Listening to this novelwhile being outside —surrounded by plants -birds - squirrels- trees- and water myself- added reminders of respect for the world around us....which those who spend time alone in nature know what I’m talking about: quiet transformative thoughts arise with the beauty of the ecosystems.Our human energy is tantalizingly free in ways it never is when indoors behind our computers and other technical devices. The Audiobook narrator -Cassandra Campbell, completely transported me to this world. The voice of Kya was PERFECT!!!! She used many different inflections for each character. I wanted to know Tate Walker and Jumper...but it’s Kya Clark, who dominant my heart and thoughts. She was not only abandoned by her family - but so many in her town rejected her. Abandonment as a child - hours upon hours of a solitary life ... playing in creeks, climbing trees, mudboarding the surface of the beach waters, digging for crabs, no parents around - is a memory which comes back to me from my own childhood....wandering outdoors...Kya Clark is tenacious- brave - resilient- an indomitable heroine....but has flaws too...which made me like her more. The circumstances of her unfortunate family inheritance is heartbreaking enough...but to suspect her of a crime... of murder? - it was almost hard to suspend belief. And so ugly to have a reputation as ‘swamp trash’. And how is it possible - and why - for heavens sake would a little girl kill an older bigger football player, Andrew Chase? There is suspense in this novel that I didn’t expect or know anything about when I started reading this. I had no idea I was about to read about a murder mystery...not that it’s the prime focus.. but... so much about this book with ‘mostly’ positive reviews....were surprises to me.

31,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41918078-debbie-w,Rating 2 out of 5,"I must be the last person on Goodreads to read this massively-popular book (and one of the few who weren't all that enamored with it!)Why I thought this story was just okay:1. the vividly-described biological insights of marsh wildlife along the U.S. eastern seaboard are obviously due to Ms. Owens's forte as a wildlife scientist;2. I could understand Kya's sense of loneliness/abandonment/rejection as she wouldn't have been privy to appropriate socialization skills in her formative years; and,3. the use of dialect (although I question if it was realistic or stereotypical?)What made me give this story only 2 stars:1. some scenes seemed too nicely wrapped up and tied with a bow - they lacked plausibility for me;2. the ""mystery"" part was redundant to me; 3. the courtroom scenes dragged the plot; and, 4. the dialogue seemed simplistic and/or forced.Over the years, I've read several debut novels with much more sophisticated writing in regards to plot and characterization. I think without the ""murder mystery"" plot line, this could have been written as a strong character-driven story. Or maybe not."

I’ve moved this book to the #1 spot in my list of favorite books of 2018. Thanks to my Goodreads friends Angela and Diane for bringing this book to my attention :)This 5* book is masterfully written, with outstanding character development. That alone would be a great book but there is much more. There is a love story and mystery woven through the story, and add art and poetry to that and you have this incredible book. Well as to the plot I will give you a little information on that, although you’ve all probably read the book blurb. At the beginning of the story we are introduced to Kya, a 6 year old little girl who has already been traumatized for life. Her mother leaves her father and the five children and never returns. Then slowly throughout some years her older siblings leave and then finally her brother whom she was very close to and her drunken father. They leave her completely alone in their falling down shack, no provisions and barely any clothing. She was only 14, she was completely alone and had no idea how to survive, but somehow she does. She has an incredible will and she loves the marsh, it’s the only home she’s known. She learns to fish, cook and clean just by remembering how it used to be. Barkley Cove, where she goes for groceries and gas has a store that is run by an extremely kind and generous couple who have lived on the marsh their entire life. She exchanges mussels and then smoked fish for gas for her motor and a few groceries. Mabel gives her used books, shoes, anything that she can get donated. They were her only friends.Kya has two real love relationships in the book. Tate she has known all of her life but now that she is older she views him differently, she begins to feel real love. He teaches her how to read which opens up the world to her. He is in her life for quite a few years and she seems happy, her life is good. She loves the marsh and all that inhabit it. She collects many things and categorizes them. From the books Tate brings her she learns biology, math, how things grow and change and she is fascinated by the marsh. The author describes the marshland so well I felt myself transported there, felt the humid air, the squashing feel when I walked and encountering all of the creatures described in this book.It’s incredible to think that this could happen but I really think there are those people who live in the marsh. Quoting from the book “this infamous marsh became a net, scooping up a mishmash of mutinous sailors, castaways, debtors, and fugitives dodging wars, taxes or laws that they didn’t take to. The ones malaria didn’t kill or the swamp didn’t swallow bred into a woodsmen tribe of several races and multiple cultures. .. . . . .two hundred years later, they were joined by runaway slaves, who escaped into the marsh and were called maroons, and freed slaves, penniless and beleaguered, who dispersed into the water-land because of scant options.""After being disappointed in her relationship with Tate she finally decides that perhaps she could be more trusting. She shares things with Chase, a boy from town who tells her he loves her, talks about a future. But everyone always leaves Kya.Then one especially happy day for Kya, she had met with the publishers of her books, two at this time, but gets an awful message from Jumpin’ upon her return, Chase is dead. The sheriff is looking for Kya and there are rumors in town that perhaps Chase’s death was not an accident.Oh my gosh this review is too long and there is so much more to say. I don’t want to spoil any portion of this gorgeous read. There is beautiful poetry and paintings that I felt I could see. Read this book, you will be wonderfully surprised, entranced and feel great about a book again. Read Kya’s story, she will stay with you a very long time.I received an ARC of this book from the publisher through NetGalley and Edelweiss."

I definitely thought it improved in the second half. 3.5 ⭐️ “Go as far as you can - way out yonder where the crawdads sing.”  I was nervous to say the least when I picked this one up. Hyped books worry me now as I’ve disliked a few and people can be really nasty about it. I got to about page 140/150 and I wasn’t enjoying it. The descriptions were wonderful but the plot was thin. I cared about the murder mystery element and Kya’s childhood. I cared a lot less about her relationships with Tate and then with Chase. However, I pushed through and after about page 200 I found I was enjoying myself and certainly more gripped. I loved following the court case, the discrimination Kya suffered due to the small minds of a small town. Overall I did like it. I wouldn’t put it up there with all the 5 star reviews but I am glad to say I’ve read the whole thing 😊**********************50p in a charity shop! Winning!"

But anyway...I picked this up at 8:38pm last night thinking I'd just bang out a few chapters before hitting the sack....and just before 1am I turned the last page. #readerlifeBeing that I literally downed this thing in one sitting, you're probably surprised I'm not rating this higher. And so am I. I mean, I flew through it and decided to stay up to finish it when it was midnight and I was starting to get tired. But I only had 60 pages left, so...I kind of just wanted to know how it ended and figured 20-30 more minutes of reading was no skin off my nose. But I digress. I expected this book to be a little different than it was, I think. I expected a haunting literary tale about a backwoods town and an abused girl's childhood struggle through the marsh. What I got instead felt not so much haunting, but a little YA-ish (as far as the romance went), a little slapstick comedy (as far as the police and courtroom scenes went), and a little like an ad for a poet I'd never heard of (which, despite making sense in the end), annoyed me. I did enjoy the setting and the ending (convenient and somewhat unbelievable as it was), but those things didn't offset the stuff I just mentioned. Long story short: Like I said, this was missing the haunting quality I wanted...I never connected to the characters (especially Kya) the way I was supposed to...the tone felt uneven...and the poetry and writing was just not my jam per se. So, sadly, I land firmly on the outskirts on this one. Oh well."

Video : https://youtu.be/y2Ip0jZZErgThe original review:1⫸ Botswana She and her (ex)husband, Mark, were traveling around the world mostly Africa for her job, zoologiste. They didn’t like the fact the Bostonian gouvernement wasn’t exploiting the Mass Safari and started criticizing its actions to preserve and not exploit its resources.Article: *Mark and Delia Owens first arrived in Zambia in 1986 after getting kicked out of Botswana, where they had made themselves unwelcome by criticizing the government’s conservation policies.She and her husband claim on interviews that they wanted to protect Botswana’s natural resources because the Botswana was a huge exporter of beef meat. Botswana’s gouvernement says otherwise and insists on the fact that the Owens were outraged that the Botswana didn’t favorise its animal and vegetable diversity to simply serve as divertissement with safari and let’s be honest it was in the 80’s so the first and basically only people that were concerned about safari ""diVertiSsemEnt"" were PEOPLE LIKE THE OWENS. Still debatable but let’s see this article extrait.Article: * Quett Masire, the President of Botswana at the time, said of the Owenses, “If you cannot operate within the bounds of government, whom you are a guest of in this country, to work these issues out, then work elsewhere.”The Owenses felt roughly handled. Mark Owens later told People, “They fingerprinted us, threatened us, treated us like criminals. We weren’t allowed to call the Embassy or get a lawyer. We lost everything. It took a lot of healing to get over it.”* Hum.. they treated them like criminals? Still wondering why.. but anyway, Botswana 1 . Owens 02⫸ MURDER/ZambiaSHE AND HER FAMILY NEED TO BE IN JAIL. She and her (ex)husband and his son were/ are accused of committing murder in Zambia 1990-1995.

Mark said he would whip us into shape. He would beat us. He would beat us with sticks. He was a very bad man.”**Kampamba said, “He said you should teach them a lesson to make sure they don’t come to the park. The lesson was to beat them. There were many beatings.”*Reminds you of something? Yeah, the white supremacy in its splendor again. THE AUDACITY TO GO TO ANOTHER COUNTRY ""third world country"" and act like the lands are yours, terrorizing citizens and exploiting abundantly its resources. And they acted surprised when the Botswana treated them like criminals.The murder was disguised as a ""hunt accident"" but what happened there is morbid, inhumane, barbaric. What they did was a ""Tuerie ethnique"" i didn’t find the right translation in English but literally it means ""ethnic killings."" Which basically consisted on paying for safaris and hunt and kill black people these acts are more common than we can imagine mostly orchestrated by mercenaries./!\ Some gory explicit scenes/!\Article: *“I don’t know what was going on in Chris’s mind,” Everson said. “He had a rush of blood to the head.

He has been arrested numerous times, and in 2001 he was convicted for misdemeanor assault after attacking a man in a Portland bar. He has since pled guilty to misdemeanor charges of assault and terrorizing. … In December, 2003, Christopher was living in the town of Palmyra. According to a neighbor, Christopher Silva, Owens was hunting in the woods near his home when he shot and killed one of Silva’s dogs and injured another. “One of the dogs came out of the woods with one of his legs missing, and so I ran out and looked for the other one,” Silva told me. “I found the body hidden under some leaves.”  The police searched Owens’s house soon after, and found a rifle with a scope attached. In a statement for the police, Owens wrote that he believed the dogs were actually coyotes.**And I reported that the Zambian police detective in charge of the subsequent investigation, Biemba Musole, had concluded that Mark Owens, with the help of his scouts, placed the victim’s body in a cargo net, attached it to his helicopter, and then dropped it into a nearby lagoon.*Although her husband and his son are the only presumed murderers some sources denounce that she helped maniganciez it.Article : *Zambian police officials I met with are keen to interrogate Mark and Christopher Owens, but also believe that Delia Owens should be interrogated as a possible witness, co-conspirator, and accessory to felony crimes.*3⫸Racisme ? Why is the book problematic?The documentary produced on ABC in 1996 relating ""their tragic"" experience in Zambia : ""Deadly Game: The Mark and Delia Owens Story "" First can well all admire the audacity to call what happened Deadly Game this honestly is beyond me and my sanity. But again I shouldn’t be shocked by them being tactless..She clearly was inspired by the murder they committed to write the book.Article :  *Most interestingly – and controversially – the documentary included the filmed murder of an alleged poacher, a clip which can be found on YouTube today. It's explicit and in the shocking segment that shows the dead body, neither the victim nor the person(s) who delivered the fatal shots is identified.*And in an interview she even compared herself to the heroine saying she was blamed for a crime and a murder she didn’t commit as well.  yeah, i smell the ""white whining bullshit"" tooSome journalists and readers are assuring that she clearly wrote the character after her. I haven’t read her books. Article : *Readers who made the connection between the Delia Owens of Crawdads and the Delia Owens of the New Yorker investigation. So I got a copy of Crawdads and I have to say I found it strange and uncomfortable to be reading the story of a Southern loner, a noble naturalist, who gets away with what is described as a righteously motivated murder in the remote wild.”** Her heroine stand accused of murder echoes the Owens’ Zambian experience and the subsequent ordeal of becoming the subject of a 18,000-word exposé in a prominent magazine. Even more eyebrow-raising is the plot twist in the novel’s final pages: It turns out Kya did, after all, murder Chase.*She also said on an interview that black people are inferior and stupid  and you can tell that when they start talking.

36,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2431873-emily,Rating 1 out of 5,"I'm genuinely surprised by the good reviews for this book. There's some decent nature writing in here, but that's coupled with a ridiculous, hackneyed plot and some of the worst dialogue I've ever read. It would take almost complete suspension of belief to truly buy into Kya's character or any of the events of this book. For instance:* Kya's entire family leaves her, at the age of six, alone in a swamp with an abusive father. I could understand this perhaps from the older siblings, at a stretch (who don't know that she is the only one left), but every single person leaving her there?* The appearances of Tate and then Chase are incredibly silly. I could accept one boy showing up in the swamp and trying to get to know Kya, and it would make sense for that boy to be Tate given his affinity for the marsh. But two of them? And these are the only people, in the entire time that Kya is in the marsh?* How is Kya able to have conversations or function in social settings if she spends the formative years of her life alone in a swamp, hiding from her father?* I'm sorry ......... we are supposed to believe that Tate teaches Kya to read, and without any formal schooling or any association with the outside world, she starts reading complicated works of nonfiction and science? You can say whatever you want about the value of the school that Kya would have gone to, but she has had zero experience of the world or people outside of the marsh. How is she able to put any of that into context or understand it? * We get it. Kya is hot. She is SO HOT that the playboy of the town is mysteriously drawn to her and spends literal WEEKS romancing her. This is definitely something that Chase did and something that happened.On top of all of that, the dialogue in this book is atrocious. Kya - who, again, has never been to a school and has had conversations with a maximum of four people after she turns seven - somehow speaks perfect, literate English, holds conversations with aplomb, and expresses ideas like ""My mother, too, was a victim."" Her friend Tate, educated in the school system, speaks similarly, and yet the star quarterback and scion of a rich family, Chase, speaks like a caricature of a country bumpkin and barely ever utters a word that isn't riddled with dialect. I suppose you could argue that the expression of the ideas is one thing and that the ideas themselves are another. Alas, the dialogue between the two lawmen assigned to the murder case is like someone writing the script of a Law and Order episode by memory 10 years later, with a healthy amount of ""Dagnabits!"" thrown in. It's truly quite bad. The reveals at the end of the book are tough, too. LOL at Kya as Amanda Hamilton, and LOL at this courtroom scene that attempts to draw all of these threads together into something resembling a theme. I'm not even going to address the idea that Kya killed Chase. Get out of here."
37,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59568642-kevin-kuhn,Rating 4 out of 5,"“Where the Crawdads Sings” is a rich, well-written novel that, like a good southern meal, left me satisfied and content but not engrossed or astonished as the back cover promised. Maybe I’m a little burned out on young girl coming of age stories having read two others in the prior year. “All the Ugly and Wonderful Things” was more raw and honest, and “Educated” was more emotional and personal, being a memoir. Still, Owens' might be the best writer of the three, and is at her best describing the flora and fauna of the North Carolina wetlands. All three of the books are touted as debut novels (which I guess technically is true), but Owens is already an award-winning and bestselling author of non-fiction wildlife books. Let’s breakdown what I like and didn’t about this novel. Delia Owen’s and her publisher clearly knocked it out of the part with the cover and title. But more important - Owen’s writing is lush and vivid, mostly in setting, but the characters felt fully formed to me as well. The plot was rich, first with a dysfunctional family, then as a survival story, and finally as a murder whodunit. I did like how the author interspersed the beginnings of the murder mystery component in the form of flash forwards, throughout the book, increasing the conflict and intrigue earlier into the book. And while the author left me enough clues to guess the ending, it was engaging until the end. My biggest issue was that the plot was largely predictable. The plot flowing along like a meandering river, not like the twists and turns and tributaries of a dense marsh. The pacing wasn’t bad, but it did get a bit choppy in the middle. I don’t want to leave any spoilers, but let me just say, a few plot points weren’t surprising, but they popped up, out of nowhere, making me feel like I had missed some pages. In addition to the plot, I also never became invested in the characters, maybe because I’m a little burned out on this type of story line. While the swamp and the creatures and the waterways felt real enough to me, the characters themselves, while being well described and true to their motives, didn’t quite pull me in.Big picture, I enjoyed reading the story, never felt bored, but it was as much of the description of the setting and the major plot questions, then it was an emotional investment. A descriptively written, and interestingly plotted story that transitions from a coming of age tale to a murder mystery."

""Marsh is not swamp.""
Unfortunately, I am in the minority that didn't fall in love with this book. The sadness was too over the top, the writing too flowery, the plot was a bit haphazard, the Amanda Hamilton poems sprinkled here and there made me roll my eyes more often than not, and the ending didn't feel true to the character at all. Reading it was easy enough, and I was interested, but I felt sadness and anger more than anything. To be honest, I'm still a little irked about it all. So let me elaborate.The sadness permeated the book from the beginning, but the fancy writing, as well as the continuous personification of the marsh, constantly clashed with the emotion we were supposed to be feeling. It was like the tone of the book and the actual printed words simply didn't mesh. The conflicting signals made it hard for me to concentrate on and absorb the descriptions of the marsh. As far as the plot goes, it jumped back and forth in time, and it wasn't necessarily in order. At first it jumped between Kya's childhood, and the discovery of the body, and stayed in chronological order for a while, but then the timeline switch would become wherever the author felt like going at the moment. I'm not a big fan of jumping back and forth, but when it's done right, it doesn't take away from the story. This was not one of those times. The poems were incessant and always by the same made-up poet. I would've enjoyed poetry here and there by different people, but the poetry in this case was underwhelming and unwanted. Then the ending was such complete bullshit, it aggravated me. It felt completely wrong and left a lot of unanswered questions. The only things I actually liked about this were the characters of Kya and Tate, and learning about the marsh.There are tons of people who loved it, but I have to say that I wouldn't really recommend it. I don't regret reading it, but I didn't enjoy it either. However, if you like reading sad books, want your time scrambled, or don't have a long reading list, go ahead and read it. If you are like me, and that's not your cup of tea, I would have to advise you to pass on this one.""Way out yonder, where the crawdads sing."""
39,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is an incredibly beautiful novel from Delia Owens, totally immersive, an ode to the natural environment and the marshes in particular. Catherine Danielle Clark, aka Kya, is 6 years old when her mother leaves their shack in the remote wilderness of the North Carolina coastal marshes, next to the town of Barkley Cove. Her family is desperately poor, and before long her siblings follow suit, abandoning her to the care of her alcoholic, neglectful and abusive father, and at 14 years old, he too leaves her for good. Completely isolated, school proves to be a tortuous experience, she stays for only one day, avoiding all attempts by the truant officer and others to bring her back. Kya is the Wild Child, The Marsh Girl, Marsh Trash as far as the residents of Barkley Cove are concerned, directing hate, ridicule, contempt and hurtful prejudice at the bewildered Kya, as she becomes the target of harrassment and attacks, the community dehumanising and shunning her. No-one other than the black Jumpin and his wife, Mabel, offer help or advice to the lonely girl, and they face a barrage of racist attacks and humiliation themselves.Unable to read and write, longing for the return of her mother, Kya desperately desires company, and to belong. For a while, she receives some sustenance in the form of Tate, who looks out for her, teaches her to read and write, and shares Kya's joy in the marsh world with its insects, wildlife, birds, weather and her untethered hold it has on her, collecting ever rare feathers and shells. A close relationship develops between the two of them until he leaves to study marine biology at university. Tate leaving has the effect of chipping away at Kya's inner capacity to trust as she once again finds herself isolated, but her curiosity about the marshes, and her ability to paint all that resides within it, has her pursuing a deeper and more academic knowledge of it. However, she still wants to belong and her burgeoning sexuality and hopes for marriage and family are met with betrayal, treachery and worse. In a narrative that goes back and forth in time from the 1950s to the present of 1969 onwards, where the favoured son of Barkley Cove, the golden boy Chase Andrews is discovered dead by two boys, having fallen from a tower. There is no evidence of murder, but the Sheriff is uneasy, and Andrews’s mother and the town are bursting with rumours of murder so a trial ensues.Owen has written a captivating and mesmerising novel, unforgettable in its vibrant descriptions of the marsh location and the life within it. Juxtaposed with that is the small town of Barkley Cove, indifferent at best, malicious and dangerous at its worst, with none of the spirit of compassion to support a young child forced to find ways to financially survive, emotionally bereft, finding comfort in poetry that lends weight to her inner feelings. Despite all the horrors and struggles she faces, she makes something of herself, something which Barkley Cove refuses to acknowledge. Her profound sensitivity to nature, which proves to be the ultimate educator, shapes Kya's perception of the human behaviour she encounters. The marsh is where she belongs, it and all that it entails is home, everyone else has left her, leaving her exposed and vulnerable when she begins to feel fear. It is barely surprising that when elements of her life begin to shift that she would be wary and distrusting, although buried parts of her harbour tiny sparks of hope. This is simply superb storytelling that winds it way into your heart as I rooted for Kya amidst the barrage of turbulence and heartbreak she endures. Amazing read. Many thanks to Little, Brown for an ARC."

It's not about the story or the characters but again, it's the plot and the characters that made a huge difference! I read the first half really fast (I just couldn't stop reading it and then I was ruthlessly distracted by reality like exams, presentations, classes, work, family, best friends!). I absolutely loved the first half of the book talking about the abandoned youngest girl child of a broken family. This is the story of this girl who did everything on her own to survive. But what appealed more was the way she totally relied on nature and a rare few strangers to survive. This story intensely studied such a character, who's thoroughly neglected and shunned for no fault of hers, how she evolved into a woman and as one of the most famous authors writing on nature. Even though I loved the first part, I felt like I was watching a movie and I could not get the feel of real characters. It felt like the characters were some good actors. But I enjoyed the first part the most.And after a few days' gap, I finally got the chance to pick up the book again. The second half was a real struggle. It tried to work out the murder mystery in details in which our main character, Kya, was the main suspect. The chapters kept going on and on and on. I was almost about to skip some chapters but somehow I got through them and well, it was worth it. It's because of these chapters that I actually came to appreciate the last few chapters and the ending. All I want to say now is that the book started good and it ended well.This book is a character driven one in which the characters are pretty convincing. The writing style is endearing and flawless. The poetry references, the talk about books and nature; the human nature, our basic instincts and weaknesses have been beautifully captured. Even though the book was good, I couldn't love most of the characters especially the main character. And I can understand the reason why her character was made this way. It's really convincing though. Her character remains detached even to the reader. The ending though. Kya seems like a character who you can easily figure out but the last few pages have something else to say!I absolutely loved the characters of Tate Walker and Jumpin'. These characters made a huge impact in the character development of the main character. I wish the world is full of people like them.As for the romance and the relationships, I simply didn't like it. It felt more toxic and harmful. But yes, my fav character made me believe in love again.I disliked the almost similar 20 chapters out of 57 chapters on the murder mystery thing. But still, this is going to be a memorable read."

With the departure of their matriarch, the Clark family slowly but surely vanishes into the marsh that will become the only family Kya will ever know. Her siblings leave shortly after her mother, leaving Kya alone with her father who negligent at best and abusive at worst. She is left to raise herself, care for her father and their home as she struggles with feelings of abandonment, a deep loneliness and fear that during one of her father’s absences social workers will come whisk her away to the dreaded group home. She knew the years of isolation had altered her behavior until she was different from others, but it wasn’t her fault she’d been alone. Most of what she knew, she’d learned from the wild. Nature had nurtured, tutored and protected her when no one else would.It’s the 1950’s when we’re given the bulk of Kya’s story and upbringing. To say it was difficult is putting it in the absolute mildest terms. She has no education to speak of, she has no means to make money and she must rely on her whit and the lessons of the marsh and a few kind townspeople. For the most part, people avoid her, don’t let their children play with her, mock and marginalize her. As we see Kya grow, what really shows most brightly for me was her utter resilience. She is one of the strongest and most genuinely likable characters I’ve come across in a long time.While Kya’s story is our main timeline, there is a dual timeline running in 1969 that starts off with the death of town legend and golden boy Chase Andrews. As rumors entrench the town about what could have happened to Chase, what might have happened in his past with Kya things get sticky. Sometimes she heard night-sounds she didn’t know or jumped from lightning too close, but whenever she stumbled, it was the land who caught her. Until at last, at some unclaimed moment, the heart-pain seeped away like water into sand. Still there, but deep. Kya laid her hand upon the breathing, wet earth, and the marsh became her mother.This, at it’s heart, is a deeply sad but moving story about a misunderstood girl, about abandonment and loss. However, there are uplifting moments and characters that come into Kya’s life that shed light into her dreary and lonely world - through friendships with a shop owner named Jumpin’ and his wife Mabel, through a boy named Tate who teaches Kya not just how to read but about acceptance and friendship and joy. These two timelines slowly begin to converge upon one another and as it does the true gem of this story becomes apparent: nature and all it’s wonders. I really took my time reading this one, and while it did start off a little slow for me, what never wavered was the truly magnificent prose that Owen deals out with an incredibly deft hand. I’m not sure I’ve ever read something so empirically lovely, it’s the type of story that satisfies a need for a reader to love and appreciate language. One of my favorite things I’ve found in many historical fiction novels is the ability of an author to create secondary characters out of things like setting, the time period and in this case, the marsh itself. Kya was bonded to her planet and its life in a way few people are. Rooted solid in this earth. Born of this mother. I’m not sure I quite understood what the term atmospheric meant prior to reading this novel. The marsh, the insects, the birds, the mud and the sand permeate this entire story. It creates a heady need to immerse oneself fully in prose so elegant and indulgent that you can’t help but reflect in awe of the ability to weave such a vivid and emotional story in a way that becomes exceedingly difficult to do it justice with mere words that ultimately fall flat in comparison to what you have just read.I read this with the Traveling Sisters and we all mostly ended up in the same coulee of being enamored with the beautiful writing and development of this story!"

 Even though this book was there on The New York Times bestseller list for quite a long time, the first time I heard about this book was when a controversy involving the author Delia Owens started circling around the news when she was asked to attend the questioning in Zambia. The ABC documentary reported that Owens allegedly murdered a poacher in Zambia. The author hasn't agreed to any of the accusations, though.Reading this book after hearing about the details of the controversy will be a gruesome experience. There are a lot of similarities between what appears to have happened in Zambia and the story narrated in this book. This book was selected by Reese Witherspoon's book club and she even produced the movie adaptation of the same. I loved the way the author created the character arc of Kya Clark in the initial part of this book. The harsh realities that Kya had to go through in her life will bring tears to our eyes. But that is the only good thing I can point out in this novel. In the latter half of this book, the further character development of Kya is one of the weakest I have seen in any novel. I was wondering how a lady who was confined to the marsh right from her childhood and led a solitary life without much contact with others suddenly takes a U-turn and behaves somewhat like everyone else. The author utterly failed to pull out this transition convincingly. From thereon, everything in this book went on a downward spiral and felt artificial and filmy. It was like reading two books inside a single book. If the author had maintained the consistency she showed in the earlier part of this book, this one could have easily made an indelible impression on the reader's psyche. The way the character of Kya behaves is so inconsistent, and we keep on wondering what she will do next. After something happens, we again keep on wondering why she did that. I think the author wrote this book in multiple schedules, which might be the only reason we are not getting a natural flow while reading it. Everything else in it started to become so creepy that I tried to quit reading it several times. I badly wanted to know what happened in the end, so I protracted my punctilious effort to render through the appalling path to somehow finish it. There are multiple other factors I didn't like in it, like the geographical inconsistencies of narration and poor character development of Chase and Tate, disturbing smut and many others. Overall this book gave me a disappointing reading experience.—————————————————————————

And even T.Swift gushed about this? In conclusion, I had to read this! By the way, the trailer looks amazing!!I wasn’t completely wowed by this, but it was definitely a story that had me in my sad little feelings most of the time. Kya was left to fend for herself alone at a young age and it was great seeing her really well-thought-out growth. Throughout her journey, there are many (might not be that many) characters who have an impact on her growth. I didn’t really care for the romances in this book or the murder mystery, it was just being on this journey with Kya that had me engrossed in the book. I like that I realized how many things I take for granted, seeing Kya having to learn things on her own. That ending though? I did not see that coming, and it definitely added a pretty good touch to the book. I experienced little to no confusion while reading this book. There was just a lot of anticipation for the different things that could happen and most were met and some were even exceeded. I loved that Owens made it quite easy to be rightfully on Kya’s side. It is common to have characters who have a hard time trusting people because of past experiences but Kya’s experience definitely was not like others I’ve read. One thing I found really interesting was how her mom kept coming back in her thoughts. Her mom for sure had an impact on her, and that kept making this book more sad. Overall, I always get scared about reading popular books because I’m scared I will convince myself to like them. Honestly, I’m not sure with this one because it still feels like an average book, but it felt more than average!"
44,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/138801181-ali-goodwin,Rating 3 out of 5,3.75 stars! I felt a little bit mixed about this book. Overall the story was really good! I loved getting to follow the main character over her entire life. I also love that it had a good blend of genres from romance to murder mystery to literary fiction. My only complaint is that I thought it moved a bit slow at parts.

She never wore those heels and she never carried a case. That was the last time Kya saw her Ma. There has been fights before and Ma has left several times but she always came back. Over the next few weeks, Kya's oldest brother and two sisters left too. They were tired of Pa's red faced rages, which started out as shouts, then escalated into fist slugs or backhanded punches.Her Pa had fought Germany in the Second World War. His weekly disability checks were their only income. Her Pa eventually left her too at a very young age and Kya was all by herself. She lived in the marsh all by herself. She went to school once but she was teased and never went back. Steve and Benji saw a body laying in the mud. A man was laying flat on his back. Benji noticed it was Chase Andrews. They ride their bikes fast to the Sheriff's office. They let the sheriff know that they saw Chase Andrews flat out in the swamp under the fire tower. They let him know that he looked dead. The sheriff and the Dr. noticed that there wasn't any footprints near the body. None going toward the stairs or away from the stairs, none around the body and Chase Andrews footprints weren t there either. No footprints were found anywhere. This then turns into a murder mystery.I just loved the setting of this book, in the marsh. I loved the atmosphere and just felt that I was there. The descriptions of the environment, the scenery and nature was just beautiful. I am a bird watcher and loved her descriptions of the birds feathers.I also loved the mystery and suspense also.I really loved her writing style. Her writing was so beautuful. I just wanted to savor it.This was an easy five star rating for me.It just Wowed me.I loved the characters. I loved Kya the best. and felt so bad for her having to live the way that she did at a very young age. she was so intelligent. I loved Tate too, who taught Kya how to read and other subjects. I loved the poetry. I loved Jumpin and Mabel who were heroes.I could go on and on about this book but I could never give it the justice it deserves.One of my favorites for 2018?This was a Traveling Friends read and I thought it was a fantastic discussion.

By the time she is seven years old in 1952, Kya’s entire family -- two older sisters, two brothers, even her Ma -- have left, one by one, until Kya is living nearly alone in the North Carolina beach marsh, with only her Pa for company. When she’s ten, he leaves, too. But Kya stays, a true Marsh Girl and naturalist at heart. Derided by most of the local town for being “filthy” and “weird,” Kya gets just enough love and strength from Jumpin’, a black man who works on the pier; Jumpin’s wife Mabel; and a boy named Tate to keep her going despite her losses. Meanwhile, in 1969, local golden boy Chase Andrews has fallen to his death. Or was he pushed? And how does his story tie into Kya’s?
Unpopular Opinion Time Here.  I must have read this book wrong, because it has a 4.53 average rating here on GR. But what a disappointment. My friend Holly said this book gave her whiplash, and while I’m not sure it made my neck ache equally badly, it sure does have an identity crisis. It’s a sweet, heartbreaking, yet uplifting story about a lonely, abandoned child who’s been rejected by nearly everyone for no good reasons, and how she manages to bring herself up and find some success and contentment despite the long odds against her. It’s also a story of marshlands, and the creatures that inhabit them, and the seasonal shifts and movements measuring the passing of time, year in and year out. (I would have liked to read more of that story; there’s a sort-of conservation message in here but it’s pretty subtle.) And then there’s also an episode of Law & Order: 1970, or CSI: Outer Banks, following a typical murder procedural and trial format, woven in between the chapters about Kya growing up. And not, IMO, woven in very well. It’s an ugly square in a clashing color with lumpy edges that warp the entire rest of the fabric out of shape. But again, obviously I just read this all wrong, because this book was the number one best-selling hardcover in the Boston area last week. Maybe this book and I would have gotten off on a better foot if I hadn’t found the title slightly problematic from the get-go -- I’ve hung out with plenty of crayfish, and none of them sing*. The title phrase is explained as something Kya’s Ma said to mean the edge of nowhere, but it still seems to be something the author made up, not an actual thing anyone really ever says. Or, maybe this book and I were just never meant to be together. I found the whole thing to be a bit of an unbelievable fairy tale. Tate teaches Kya to read when she’s 14, and it takes, like, a minute. The next thing you know, Kya is reading heavy, scholarly tomes about the marsh and all the creatures she sees there, and becomes an expert. She goes from talking like her parents to speaking perfect English: she speaks like most people write, not how they talk. (Ugh, all the dialogue in this book is just awful, not just from Kya, but from everyone. It’s all stilted, awkward, and unnatural. I cringed every time anyone opened their mouth. And the written duplication of the local accent was just painful.) Kya also teaches herself to paint expertly, and I never stopped wondering how this moneyless child could afford all those art supplies when she could barely afford food, or soap. (Maybe it’s addressed in the story, but I missed it?) Also, the very badly done third-person omniscient POV drove me nuts. Kya is the main character, and the story is mostly told in close third-person POV through her eyes and experiences. But every so often, when it feels like it, it randomly jumps into some other character’s head for a few sentences before hopping back into Kya’s. This was jarring and didn’t add much to the story except to make sure the reader knew every male character thought Kya was beautiful and magnetic. It didn’t help that I’ve read books similar to this before. It’s slightly reminiscent of both  Island of the Blue Dolphins and  A Girl of the Limberlost. Then the ending made me throw the book across the room. First, Kya turns out to be her own favorite local poet, who is quoted extensively throughout the book, apparently so the author could put her own poems in. But the author just flat-out lies when this poet is introduced for the first time. There had to be a better way to pull off this twist, which wasn’t even that important. The poem that’s tied to the other big twist could still have been written by someone else, and inspired Kya to take matters into her own hands. Second,  Kya turns out to have murdered Chase, and I lost all sympathy for her. Yeah, he was a cad and a creeper, but that doesn’t make it okay to kill him. Am I supposed to look back at everything that happened in this story and still root for Kya? This is your typical Law & Order: SVU kind of final twist which just ticks me off and makes me feel used and manipulated.  The thing that bothers me most is, this could have been such a good story if it were just better written, tighter and more focused. I didn’t need to know every single detail of Kya’s life from age 7 to age 24. And the ending (and the entire story), would have been much more interesting to me if it had actually explored the question of “What kind of morality does a person develop when she has to raise herself, and use wild animals as her guides?” There’s a little bit of this, but not nearly enough, and it’s almost entirely applied to the “romance” portions of the story. The second twist is presented as “haha, faked you out, suckers! Now how do you feel about this girl?” There’s this beautiful speech where one character asks, “Did we reject Kya because she was weird and distant? Or did she become weird and distant because we rejected her?”, and that should have been left alone as the capstone of this story. Instead, for me, it was completely ruined. I think the biggest problem for me is what Alan says: [The author] violates her own structure in order to create a surprise ending. That means we don't really know Kya, have never really known her. Owens sacrifices narrative logic and emotional honesty for plot device. (Warning: Alan's review is a Big Fat Spoiler, so don't look at it unless you've finished the book.)But hey, almost everybody else loves this book, while I am obviously writing this review from inside a trash can on Sesame Street. So do not let my grouchiness dissuade anyone from picking this up.

47,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60866073-baba,Rating 4 out of 5,"2021 review: To call this book a unique coming of age story of a girl abandoned by her family, living in a shack in the North Carolina marshland is like saying To Kill A Mocking Bird is a unique coming of age story of a girl whose lawyer dad has to defend a Black man accused of raping a White woman in White Supremacist era Alabama! And for those of you that hate having to read a full review to get the gist... this book is a must-read!Crawdad's has fairy tale like 'good guys' and pantomime like villains; it has a pre-teen girl virtually surviving an impossible situation mainly because of her deep connection to nature and the aforementioned 'good people'; some of the romancing has echoes of the worse of 'young adult' fiction... but sandwiched between the discovery of a dead body in 1969 and the first abandon-er of the Marsh-Girl in 1952 is a pretty unforgettable, and at times deeply moving story! 9.5 out of 12, all the way! Big Four Star ReadThis was 70 year old biologist, and published science writer Delia Owens first forage into fiction, with her book that is very hard to nail down genre-wise; that is pretty well written; and is choc full of relatable and inspirational characters - ultimately sold itself, via the people that read and loved it. Even now I am not sure what to make of it, other than the movie (being filmed from April 2021) is a dead cert Oscar haul, surely? I kind of see this as a modern fairy tale for all ages... most of all I love how Owens didn't hold back on the beauty, power and resonance of nature. Is this the first big climate change pro-nature work of fiction? Just read the Goddamn book already!"
48,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9472704-linda,Rating 3 out of 5,"Jeez, Louise......I'm standing here geared up in crash helmet dodging potential house bricks possibly thrown at me. I just did not get the feels with Where the Crawdads Sing that so many of my Goodreads friends did. And, believe me, books speak to us and touch us in a whole spectrum of personal ways. We all react differently to the colors that light up on the page. But for me, I'm ankle deep in that marsh about now.Delia Owens can sure spin a tale. She absolutely did here. I stepped slowly into the initial stages of the first few chapters enthralled with the voice of six year old Kya and repulsed by the dirty end of the stick that she had been handed in life by her repugnant family. This was going to be quite the story....until it wasn't for me.In my mind's eye (me, myself, and I), I was caught up in Owens' weaving back and forth of Kya's treacherous life alone in the marsh. She did pull me in. ""As the sky and clouds struggled overhead, she said out loud, 'I have to do life alone. But I knew this. I've known a long time that people don't stay.'""But with the weaving came the reversed side devulging all the knotted threads in the background. I couldn't look away as the story began to fill with implausible situations and outcomes. I usually cut the author some slack here and there when the unbelievable starts to creep in. In this case, Where the Crawdads Sing began to lather in it. Every event had a safety net that slid in to propel the story forward. Every escalation of the plot almost came with a little disclaimer or tiny footnote explaining how that came to be. There just seemed to be some faulty scaffolding shoring this story up even in regard to the side-stepping ending.Where the Crawdads Sings is an emotional read. It draws you in as such. I would certainly suggest that everyone take it out for a test drive. I honor everyone's take on this novel. That's the only way you'll know if the glass slipper fits. Delia Owens has quite the talent here. I would look forward to her next offering. She may not have hit it out of the ballpark for me, but it did get me a seat near the dugout....and that's a good thing."

“The marsh did not confine them but defined them and, like any sacred ground, kept their secrets deep.”
This book was told in two different timelines. In the first, we follow Kya's life from age five. And the other is set in present day 1969, where Chase Andrews death is being investigated. This type of atmospheric writing is my favourite kind. The descriptions of the marsh, lagoons and all the animals were written in such a way that I felt like I was there with Kya. Kya's love for everything to do with the marsh could easily have been the opposite. She has been abandoned over and over, trapped there. But no. To Kya the marsh is her family. And I have not read anything as beautiful as Kya adoration for nature. The author really did an outstanding job at capturing Kya's loneliness and her behavior when she does interact with people was so believable. Her eventual friendships with Tate, Jumpin' and Mabel made me so happy for this lonely girl. “Please don't talk to me about isolation. No one has to tell me how it changes a person. I have lived it. I am isolation.”The mystery was fantastic. My curiosity got more intense the further I read, I needed to see how all the dots connected and I wasn't disappointed. The last 100 pages were HECTIC. I read through the night, I couldn't sleep, I was completely hooked! Those last chapters were told so cleverly, days later I'm still thinking about what happened. Where the Crawdads Sing is a book that I'll read again in a few years when the details have faded from my memory and I can experience it all over again, not new, but like visiting an old friend. 4.5 stars___Today is the perfect autumn day for me to start this book!

I’m part of the group that loved this book. ✨I'll keep this review short and sweet. I feel like I'm the last person to read this book lol Plot-  Where the Crawdads Sing tells the story of Kya, who was forced into social isolation from the age of six after her whole family, one by one, left her. The final member to leave was her abusive father. Surviving almost entirely by herself, aided only by the occasional kindness of strangers and her neighbor and his wife. Kya is ostracized and shunned by most of her neighbors. Everyone around her called her the “Marsh Girl”.Although the novel focuses on the years between 1965 and 1970, it encompasses the whole span of Kya’s life…While growing with Kya you learn of two men she falls in love with a different time in her life. Tate and Chase. In late 1969, when handsome Chase is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. Where the Carwdads Sing is told in the past leading up to the murder and flash forwards detailing the progress of the murder investigation. One part mystery, one part legal drama, one part coming of age story, and one part love story- equals a pleasurable and suspenseful story “There are some who can live without wild things, and some who cannot.”  My Thoughts-  I really enjoyed this book. This book really swept me away. I couldn’t help but get lost in Kya’s world. 1) how did she survive until adulthood? We met her when she was 6 years old… 2) who kills chase?) 3) Does she ever see her mom again? So many questions kept me totally hooked on reading this book . I just needed my questions answered. T he book is nice, but more than anything it is compelling. Kya is compelling. Her story is compelling. And with the murder mystery thrown in there, it makes it a real page-turner. Who dunnit!?! And why? And how? The compelling imagery is descriptive in the right places and sparse when it serves the story better instead. The book has a strong sense of place, transporting you to a different life where you can smell the salty air and sink your feet into the muddy grounds outside the seaside village. The book takes several various directions and merges them to form one beautiful product. The overall portrayal of the main character and her growth is just something I have never seen depicted so perfectly. The writing and story evolved allowed me to connect with it more profoundly. Oh, and that ending. Will I ever process it? Will I ever get over it? Will my love for this book ever die? No no nooo. “She knew the years of isolation had altered her behavior until she was different from others, but it wasn't her fault she'd been alone. Most of what she knew, she'd learned from the wild. Nature had nurtured, tutored, and protected her when no one else would.” 🗣️I definitely recommend this book. It a beautiful story. I think you have to be in the mood for a story like this. The pace is slow but so magical.  “Go as far as you can—way out yonder where the crawdads sing.”  Playlist- 🐚Carolina- Taylor Swift (I guess she wrote this song for this book) 🐚Have You Ever Seen The Rain- Creedence Clearwater Revival 🐚Wish You Were Here- Pink Floyd🐚Beach Baby- Bon Iver 🐚 Proud Mary- Creedence Clearwater Revival🐚Cottage Roads- The Walters 🐚Free Bird- Lynyrd Skynyrd🐚Unchained Melody- The Righteous Brothers 🐚 Stuck In The Middle- Stealers Wheels🐚Like A Rolling Stone- Bob Dylan 🐚 The Tracks Of My Tears- Smokey Robinson 🐚The Last American Dynasty- Taylor Swift 🐚 Eucalyptus- The National 🐚 Wastleand Baby- Hozier 🐚Invisible String- Taylor Swift 🐚Rhiannon- Fleetwood Mac 🐚Hello My Old Heart- The Oh Hellos 🐚River - Leon Bridges “I wasn't aware that words could hold so much.

Spoilers below, but if you’ve seen literally any Reese Witherspoon movie, you already know the story. A little Mary Sue is born into the swamp to an alcoholic father and long suffering mother, the last of a clutch of Marsh Kids. Starting with her mother, each member of the family gets up and leaves, leaving MS with but her Pa, who is so often literally or figuratively absent she is largely left to fend for herself. Little MS makes friends with all of the animals, and is effortlessly able to find food and water, cook, and navigate the swamp from age six without real struggle, disease, or injury, until her Pa finally disappears for good. She survives into adolescence completely estranged from the world save for the pair of Magical Negros “Jumpin’” and Mabel a short boat ride away, and then discovers the handsome, empathetic, brilliant, and perfect monosyllabic literal boy next door. He teaches her to read and brings her books, and they have a wholesome teen romance until he leaves for college, ultimately leaving MS to fall for the advances of the monosyllabic local golden / bad boy, the literal captain of the local football team. He sticks around long enough to take her shell necklace (yeah.) before she sees his engagement announcement on a rare visit into town. All the while, MS is unfailingly brilliant, entirely self-taught, and without any of the awkwardness or personality flaws one might expect of someone whose sole childhood contacts are an abusive alcoholic father and some gulls. She’s more educated than and perfectly able to be in town with everyone else, she just chooses not to be. Her amazing intelligence and artistic ability land her a book deal worth thousands without hardly trying, because MS needs no man to succeed.Before MS can return to the arms of the perfect boy next door, she’s arrested for the murder of the bad boy, because the jealous and bigoted townsfolk want to blame her, of course. She’s quickly acquitted because a legendary lawyer comes out of nowhere to defend her for free for some reason, and returns to her swamp, where she becomes independently wealthy from her books, given honorary doctorates, marries her perfect monosyllabic boy next door, and lives out the rest of her days in her dream home built by her swamp. She passes peacefully in a boat surrounded by her gulls, and in her death, the BND discovers that she bequeathed her swamp as a nature preserve, and secretly was actually the mediocre poet quoted throughout the book the whole time. She also had taken back her thinly veiled virginity metaphor from the corpse of the bad boy. The end."

And keep the tissues handy, you will need them.The saddest thing is that Kya's mother should leave and not take her. In the end there is never really an explanation as to why anyone could leave their five year old behind at the mercy of an alcoholic father. Still that is how Kya's story begins and also the whole wonderful story of what is her life.Kya turns out to be a truly remarkable individual and rises to amazing heights regardless of her appalling beginnings. There are a few people who help her but very few, and it is a miracle that she not only survives but that she makes something special of her life on the marsh.There is a love story in this book too. Although Kya has little to guide her in normal society led behaviours she is always aware that Tate is special and fortunately he feels the same about her. The feather boy and the marsh girl were always meant for each other .There is even a twist at the end - a surprise the reader is really not expecting. What a wonderful book, from first to last - perfect."

The writing is lovely, and the storytelling is brilliant.Barclay Cove is a quiet place along the North Carolina coast. I tried to imagine this setting and time period, as someone familiar with the area, and I could not quite fit where it was in reality; however, using the author’s extraordinary gift for description without being overly flowery, in my imagination, I can perfectly picture the mysterious marsh. The book begins with the story of Kya, a young girl whose mother walks out on the family, leaving the children to fend for themselves with an alcoholic father who is absent most of the time. Not to mention the fact that they live in the inhospitable marsh as squatters (there are, indeed, small settlements on the North Carolina coast today that were founded my “squatters”). Kya’s siblings are older, and they flee, leaving her alone with her father. She learns to care for herself at a young age because she has to. Kya is uneducated by choice and circumstance, though the town attempted to get her to attend at first. Even without schooling, she is sharp and caring, as she learns the ways of life through the marsh and all it has to teach her. For years, Kya lives this way and is known as the “Marsh Girl” by the townies. When a young man of the same age is found dead, everyone in town assumes it must have been Kya, and fingers are pointed. She has been involved with two young men who were entranced with her, but was Kya involved in the death of Chase Andrews? Where the Crawdads Sing is a glorious and equally somber coming of age story for Kya. Though she was called to a different life from the one she has always known, how much will her upbringing continue to control who she is? The writing is exquisite, the setting atmospheric on a grand scale, and Kya is a strong and unforgettable character I wanted to hug. Overall, I simply adored this book. I was immersed completely in Kya’s vibrant world, and my heart ached at every turn. The ending is memorable, and the messages are strong. Beautiful nature and a captivating story. Thank you to G.P.

Such an easy read and the fantastic storyline, this book was so GOOD! The details are rich and flavorful…I loved the walk in the marsh this book gave me. I felt all the feels and my imagination ran wild. The twists and turns were impeccable. I could only suspect how things were going to go, but nope! I like it when a book does that. Do yourself a favor and cozy up to enjoy this immersive read! I think it’s well worth the time."
58,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63328133-sheri,Rating 3 out of 5,"I enjoyed Where the Crawdads Sing, but I wasn't enamored with it as so many other reviewers seem to be. There is much that I didn't like and thus I wasn't able to rate it any higher than I perhaps generously did. I liked that so many emotions are experienced by both Kya and the reader. Delia Owens certainly knows how to engage her readers' sympathies. Kya knows joy and wonder, yet also sorrow, loneliness, and anger. Through it all she never loses her resiliency, perhaps because she knows nothing else but to just keep on. Her extremely limited life hasn't shown her other choices and you root for her to overcome her circumstances. One of the negative aspects for me is that if you take away all the nature descriptions, you aren't left with much of a story. There is extensive marsh and wildlife description, and generally such excess would have me skipping over all the description to get back to the story, but I did read all of it and learned a lot about the flora and fauna of the marsh as well as marsh living. I certainly think it served its purpose to help build Kya's character and her world. But still, at the end, I looked back at it and thought there was so much description and was it all necessary?The most major problem for me  is that there are too many unbelievable happenings for me to be fully on board with this story. Kya's character is too much; the author has written her to be some sort of uber being with genius level intelligence. I would have liked the story if Kya was just an ordinary young woman who managed to successfully overcome her disadvantageous upbringing, and even if the author wanted to take it a step further and give her a little something more like being a talented poet, I still could have believed that it was possible. But no, not only is she a talented poet, she's also an accomplished marsh botanist and ornithologist. That was just too much for me; I couldn't believe that her informal education from another youth (even if he was pretty smart himself) led her to such supreme abilities. I also found her actions and words to be too spot on when Tate returns and she yells at him for leaving her. She says exactly what you'd expect a young woman to say in such a situation, but yet being alone in the marsh she hasn't had or witnessed such experiences to learn such behavior. The words and actions she displays are learned behaviors but she doesn't have the social interactions in her background to know that that is how one reacts in such affairs.I'll list a few of the other more minor things I didn't like:-- I don't know how much things cost back then, but did she really make enough money to buy food and gas? Also, over all the years, not once did the boat need any repairs? Either minor repairs that she didn't have the ability to do herself or major repairs that would have cost a considerable amount to fix?-- I don't understand how Kya speaks standard English yet all the other characters speak the regional dialect? -- Everyone in town knew she existed, but no one was concerned about this young child's health and welfare? Even if they didn't know she was alone, they knew she wasn't in school, she didn't have much money for groceries when she did come to town, and she wore ill-fitting clothes, but no person of authority thought to look a little harder into the situation? -- Kya knows biology, yet never is there the slightest thought that she might get pregnant during her sexual escapades?-- The overall feeling that many things were tied up a little too neatly and too succinctly. Chase and the entire murder investigation come to mind, but other smaller things were also conveniently and plausibly explained in just one sentence instead of building those explanations into the storyline. I did enjoy the story overall including the nature descriptions, and if I look back it as fairy-tale fiction with the requisite happy ending, then I can give it a three star rating despite its many flaws."

While reading this novel there was always this niggling annoyance in the forefront of my mind telling me that I wasn’t connecting with the third person narrative here. I am not exactly sure what it was for me but that really bothered me that I wasn’t able to give this story my whole heart. Regardless of not connecting with the third person narrative I thought this story and the words written were absolutely beautiful though. And in the end after long discussions with my dear friend, Kris she helped me work out my feelings towards this book and come to a few realizations that were pivotal. I am so happy to say that I was able to get that warm fuzzy feeling that I was so desperately seeking from this book.WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING by DELIA OWENS was an engrossing, moving, heartbreaking and charming coming of age, love story and murder mystery novel all wrapped up into one incredible and delightful story. I was immediately drawn into this quiet and powerful story that revolves around the survival and resilience of an unforgettable young girl named Kya, abandoned at the age of 10 and growing up alone in the marsh. Kya’s story consumed my thoughts and my heart totally while I was reading this novel. She had me laughing, smiling, crying, worried and rooting for her every step of the way. DELIA OWENS delivers an intriguing, atmospheric, suspenseful and beautifully written read here that is so vividly descriptive and absolutely mesmerizing. The descriptions of the marsh and everything that it entails pertains so meaningfully to this story. Unlike Kya, I just wish that it didn’t take me as long to come to that realization of how meaningful the marsh was to her whole being and story.*Traveling Friends Read* This was an awesome group read with an absolutely wonderful discussion and with the help from Brenda and our Traveling Friends I was able to fully enjoy this novel! Thank you friends!  Norma’s Stats:Cover: Eye-catching, beautiful, and an extremely fitting representation to storyline. Title: Fits the story so well and love how it plays so meaningfully into the story. I also really enjoyed the few lines in the book that referred to the title.Writing/Prose: Well-written, lovely, eloquent, and engaging. Plot: Entertaining, thought-provoking, captivating, steady-paced, held my attention and extremely enjoyable. Even though I had some reservations with the third person narrative it did not take away my enjoyment for the story.Ending: Bittersweet, powerful, rewarding, and very satisfying.Overall: An outstanding, emotional, memorable, and heartfelt read!

61,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54886546-lindsay-l,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 stars. Heartbreakingly unforgettable. Deeply symbolic. Hauntingly atmospheric. This is the story of Kya, a ‘marsh girl’ who grows up isolated from society. Abandoned by her mother at the tender age of six, Kya is left vulnerable and constantly awaiting her return. At the age of ten, Kya is deserted by the rest of her family, leaving her completely alone to fend for herself in the wild and unruly marsh. There are a few characters that enter Kya’s life, each having a direct impact on her development and views of the world. Each of the characters are memorable and very well developed. Kya’s story is one that will stick with you - it is emotional, disturbing, shocking and touching. While I enjoyed this story, I am the outlier in the sense that I did not love and adore this book as much as most others have. The biggest thing that didn’t quite work for me was the pace of the novel – it dragged throughout. The marsh descriptions, though vivid and atmospheric, felt too much at times and I was lost in these descriptions rather than the story itself. With that being said, I feel it was fully intentional to have such overpowering descriptions and that is what many readers truly loved and connected with – it simply didn’t work for me.This was a Traveling Friends read. The discussion was wonderful! To find this review, along with the other Traveling Sister reviews, please visit our blog at:https://twosisterslostinacoulee.com/2...Thank you to Edelweiss, G. P.

“Autumn leaves don't fall, they fly. They take their time and wander on this their only chance to soar.” 
For years, rumors of the “Marsh Girl” haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet fishing village. Kya Clark is barefoot and wild; unfit for polite society. But Kya is not what they say. Kya—a young girl who has been abandoned by her parents, siblings, and the entire society, lives on the outskirts of town, in the Marsh, where she is judged & ridiculed. Having attended just one day of school, she takes life's lessons from the land, learning the real ways of the world while living in solitude forever. WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING is an incredible story of fearless Kya while she carves her own life path. Where the Crawdads Sing is a story of survival, hope, love, loss, loneliness, determination, and strength. I wasn’t really sure what to expect when I went into this book and it turned out to be one of the most compelling stories I’ve read in a long time. This was a story of survival against all odds, of love and loss, of grief and happiness, of prejudices and relationships, and discovering your true self. 
“If anyone would understand loneliness, the moon would.” 
This book is so poetic and beautifully written, that it just draws you in with the flow. The beautiful prose and the use of imagery are so to the point that you are automatically transported to the marshes where you can see the gulls, feel the sea wave, and feel the sand beneath your feet. The story is charmingly written and immensely readable. The book was perfectly paced and jumps back and forth in time without missing a beat. If I have to nitpick, the secondary plotline didn’t work for me and disrupted the flow of the story, like a speed breaker. Thankfully, it didn’t ruin my reading experience. As soon as the book starts, you are a part of Kya’s life and immersed in her self-contained world. You experience her moments of sorrow, her fleeting moments of happiness, her triumphs and heartbreaks, all of it. Another thing that takes the book to another level are the characters. Kya, Tate, Jumpin', Jodie, all are exquisitely crafted. I loved the main character of Kya. It was so interesting to watch Kya grow up without a family and deal with the world. Her amazing journey and interactions are at the heart of the book and Owens gets it perfectly right. The characters spoke in their own dialect which adds a layer of authenticity to the story. Overall, Where the Crawdads Sing is a compelling and emotional story, spectacularly written and richly detailed with a descriptive atmosphere and realistic characters. There are many heartbreaking moments in this book that will stay with you long after the story is over. This book will make you smile, it will make you emotional, at times it will break your heart and it will make you care for the characters like they are your own. I wish really the book could have gone on and on, as I never wanted the story to end. Many thanks to the publisher's Penguin Publishing Group and Edelweiss for the ARC.  "
64,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5211606-julie-g,Rating 3 out of 5,"What this novel has going for it: location, location, location.Delia Owens was a genius to choose the remote North Carolina marshlands for her debut novel; without even consciously realizing it, we, as readers, are often drawn to primordial locales: marshes, bayous, deserted islands. Even without someone like Viggo Mortensen standing in the shallow water in a loincloth, these are sexy places, teeming with life. If you think about it, even spawning is a sexy word.Marshes are hotbeds of sex and procreation, so I had high hopes for this one. I was not only raised in South Florida, fifteen minutes from the Everglades and the Atlantic ocean, I have wanted to live in the state of North Carolina since about the age of seven. The Tar Heel State has had a great pull on my heart and I wanted so desperately to love this novel.But, if you put the location aside here, you are left with the characters, and almost zero character development. The protagonist, Kya, is as unformed as an amoeba, and her two suitors could, sadly, be confused for one another at any point in the novel.I've read Ms. Owens's bio, and she appears to be a great steward of our planet, and a scientist who has spent most of her career in remote settings with animals. Unfortunately, this seems to have impacted her ability to capture believable dialogue between her characters. She seems like a decent human being, but, if I were her editor, I would advise her to start listening compulsively to other humans talk. Eavesdropping on antelopes just won't do the trick in novel writing.Other significant mistakes were made here, especially the author's decision to ignore the age old advice of “show, don't tell,” and far too many conveniences cropped up here for my taste, to artificially support the weak plot, that I was using the word “contrived” to describe the book by page 14.It seems like Delia Owens has had experiences similar to women like Dian Fossey and Jane Goodall, and it's possible she could bring these natural settings to life in future novels, but I do think she needs to spend about 10,000 hours in coffee shops first.If you would like to read two other books that magnify the beauty of the great state of North Carolina with excellent character development and dialogue, may I recommend Cold Mountain and Prodigal Summer?And, if any of you are out in the marsh with your binoculars and you spot a loincloth clad Viggo. . . please, be respectful of Nature. . . that is a rare species that needs preservation."

Lots of talk of feathers and grasses and algae? Um… But I read Diane S.’s review. When Diane awards 5 stars, I have to listen. I reluctantly put it on my list. I checked my library’s Libby App. I would be number 1752 in line. That sounded pretty safe, so I signed up. Eight months went by, and suddenly I was number one when the library obtained several hundred more copies. I immediately went into defensive mode and put the book on indefinite hold. A couple of months later I read my buddy Barry’s review. Barry gave it 5 stars, which I wouldn’t have expected in a hundred years! OK, so Diane led me to water and Barry essentially forced me to drink. Barry told me he too had resisted it forever and finally went into it telling himself he could always DNF it. That made him feel safe, that he had an out. I listened to him and told him I would rethink it but would still probably hate it. I also told him that if I tried it, I would hold him responsible if I did hate it. He said he accepted that responsibility so what could I do? I read it. Boom. 5 stars.I was irreversibly hooked after about 6 %. The nature stuff is surprisingly engaging. The characters (the good guys anyway) are endearing. And what a profound coming-of-age character study this is. Though the plot is mostly character driven, I found it extraordinarily compelling and a fast read. This story is so atmospheric. I felt like I was there in the marsh with The Marsh Girl, Kya. I could feel the heat and the humidity, hear the gulls, smell the ocean, and see the beauty of nature. The writing is just superb.I’m not a poetry fan, but the snippets of poetry offered are touching and meaningful. The jumping back and forth in time is done so well—to me the technique heightens the suspense of the mystery. The epilogue is profoundly moving, and it made me cry. Not only that, I physically felt it in my heart—a very rare thing for a book to do for me. Look at all the 5-star reviews. Believe them. I also read the one and two stars reviews and while I certainly respect those reviews, I am happy I didn’t have those reactions to this book. If you have stalled like me and like Barry did, take a chance and give it a try. You can always DNF it. I take full responsibility if you hate it.Thanks to Hennepin County (MN) Public Library and the Libby App for the loan.Special thanks to Delia Owens for writing this phenomenal book.Super special thanks to Diane S. and Barry."

I felt bogged down in all of the detail. Work is busy for me so this will have to wait for the fall or winter, when hopefully things slow down for me. Portions of this novel were good and presented interesting visuals, but when I saw that I was still only at the halfway mark, and that once again my mind was wandering away from this overly-detailed story, I knew it was time to put it aside and read or listen to something else.Things just move along so slowly.... I had to replay certain sections more than once because when I would get back to listening to the book on my afternoon walks, I couldn't remember what had happened before. This is just not like me at all. Obviously, I am not fully engaged in this story. When a book starts irritating me with over-description, I know it is time to put it aside for now."

Nell
, about a feral girl alone in the woods who speaks her own language and somehow gets all tangled up in the real world. While there is a little bit of the girl-against-the-world thing, I needn't have worried. This book is heartfelt, warm, and endearing, and utterly deserving of the praise and love being heaped on it. It is definitely a story that will live in my mind for a long time.In the 1950s, Kya is a young girl growing up in a ramshackle cottage in the marshes off the North Carolina coast. She is the youngest of five children, the daughter of a wounded WWII veteran prone to drinking and violence perpetrated on his wife and children. One day when Kya was six years old, her mother left, followed by each one of her siblings. Left to fend for herself, she learns early that she is the only one she can count on, and turns to the gulls and other marsh creatures for companionship, until she befriends a couple who runs the gas and tackle shop where she refuels her boat.""Her most poignant memories were unknown dates of family members disappearing down the lane. The last of a white scarf trailing through the leaves. A pile of socks left on a floor mattress.""As Kya grows older, rumors swirl in town about the ""Marsh Girl,"" and it becomes a show of bravery to run through the marsh, tag her house, and run freely home. But Kya is so much more than the little girl once ridiculed on her one day of school. She is sensitive, inquisitive, intelligent, and passionate about the marsh and the creatures that inhabit it. When she meets a young man willing to open more of that world up to her, she can't get enough, although it leads to the vulnerability of opening her heart as well.""'It ain't just that. I wadn't aware that words could hold so much. I didn't know a sentence could be so full.""When Kya finds someone that she believes loves her for who she is, she is fearful about leaving the marsh but willing to do so for love. Yet once again, she learns she is the only one she can truly depend on. And in 1969, when Chase Andrews, once the town's football hero and the son of a prominent business owner, is found dead, the townspeople suspect Kya, as they have never believed her more than ""marsh trash"" even though she has proven herself capable of so much more.""For years I longed to be with people. I really believed that someone would stay with me, that I would actually have friends and a family. Be part of a group. But no one stayed. Not you or one member of my family. Now I've finally learned how to deal with that and how to protect myself.""
Where the Crawdads Sing
 is a love letter to nature, but it is also a beautiful story about what you can accomplish when people believe in you and instill you with that confidence. At the same time, it's a story which causes us to examine our prejudices against those who are different from us, how readily we want to believe the worst about people we don't even know. It's also a story about the beauty of human relationships, and how much they give us, even through the simplest of interactions.Delia Owens has created an amazing, thought-provoking book. Her use of imagery is so lyrical, almost poetic, that you can see the marsh, the gulls, the feathers, in your mind's eye. As great as that is, her characters are incredibly special. Even the characters who seem the least complex have surprising moments, but characters like Tate, Jumpin', Jodie, and of course, Kya, are simply amazing.There is a simple beauty to this book and so much heart. Read this and you, too, will be thinking about these characters for a long time afterward. See all of my reviews at itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com."

First it's the very slow beginning: you have to read at least hundred pages before the story gets interesting (vague murder-mystery parts aren't as intriguing as they supposed to be). And after that reader is taken on the cheap emotional roller-coaster where author uses a lot of clichés to create a drama. All just to end it with a sentimental vanilla happy end. The only good thing about the book that kept me going were incredibly beautiful descriptions - which makes total sense if you know the author's background (and explains hidden ecological message). The way she writes about nature is grapping and hypnotizing. Which I can’t say about the dialogs in this book. The narration is more emotional than them.So all in all three stars for introducing me to the undiscovered beauty of the marsh.

I didn’t know a sentence could be so full”.If Kya had grown up in the mountains of Appalachia, townies might have looked down their noses and scoffed at her as a “redneck”, “hillbilly”, or perhaps “white trash” and “trailer trash”. But since she lived deep in the Atlantic coastal tidal marshes of North Carolina, the vogue term of disparagement was “marsh girl” or “marsh trash”. Demonstrating sensitivity and an innate intelligence that was clearly off the charts to an empty audience, Kya raised herself living alone and completely isolated for years in a shack with only her ever-growing collection of biological artifacts to love:“Her collections matured, categorized methodically by order, genus, and species; by age according to bone wear; by size in millimeters of feathers; or by the most fragile hues of greens. The science and art entwined in each other’s strengths; the colors, the light, the species, the life; weaving a masterpiece of knowledge and beauty that filled every corner of her shack. Her world. She grew with them – the trunk of the vine – alone, but holding all the wonders together. But just as her collection grew, so did her loneliness … months passed into a year. Then another.”… until she encountered Tate Walker, a young man, whose yearning for her companionship, her mind, and her beauty, blossomed into a love that would not and could not be requited in the wilderness of Kya’s beloved marsh. Kya’s world slowly began to open to new possibilities as he patiently taught her to read and write. Despite his promises to return to her and stay in touch, Tate’s departure to attend university left open the possibility for Kya’s marginal encounters with civilization to take her down a different and tortuous Byzantine path. Having encountered Chase Andrews, a second young man who offered the possibility of entry into a larger world of possible friends, family and love, Kya’s world collapses when Andrew’s broken body is found at the foot of a decrepit fire tower in the marsh and she is charged with his murder.No doubt there are those that would dismiss WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING as romantic chick-lit and, to be sure, it definitely has some of that flavour that might incline readers to momentarily assign such a label. But to do so would unfairly weaken an extraordinary novel that is so much more – a murder mystery, a legal thriller, a coming-of-age narrative, a celebration of nature, science and outdoors writing, and an awesome, gut-wrenching, cautionary tale on the human frailties of racism, bigotry, xenophobia, rejection, exclusion, snobbery, and our propensity to make unwarranted judgments and draw conclusions on the basis of appearances and incomplete knowledge and information.The author herself characterized her novel in the following way:“WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING is a mystery, a love story, and a courtroom drama, but it is primarily about self-reliance, survival, and how isolation affects human behavior. Since our specises is a social mammal, we have strong genetic tendencies to belong to a group of tightly bonded family and friends. But what happens if a young girl … finds herself alone without a group? Of course, she feels lonely, threatened, insecure, and incompetent. [She] also behaves strangely, hiding behind trees when she sees others on the beach and avoiding the village. She ventures deeper into the wilds of the marsh, away from people, and in so doing begins to learn life’s lessons directly from the natural world.”WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING is a heart-warming, compelling, gut-wrenching, awesome novel that will definitely be on my TOP TEN list for 2022. Beyond that, a jaw-dropping ending inclines me to add it to that much more atmospheric list of my personal lifetime favourites. Regardless of what genre might press your buttons, I can definitely recommend WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING as an awesome read. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.Paul Weiss"

""The Marsh Girl"" (Kya) is our literary mermaid that seldom ventures into the real world where people walk around on two legs. And when she does, you can bet she will come to know trouble.The audio was really well done, it kept me on track and I enjoyed it.You may not know this about me, but I'm a big nature lover. I absolutely loved the detailed descriptions of the natural world with its different birds and shells. I can sympathize with you if you didn't love those parts. Definitely reminded me of a Barbara Kingsolver novel. The thing that is missing for me is a believability factor. Also, the author relied on a manipulative technique to keep the reader in the dark about so many aspects. I expect that in psyche thrillers, but it felt weird in a book like this. I'm not interested in a ""gotcha"" moment.A sweet, fairy tale like story with love and kissy stuff and a few minutes of violence. And lots of bird facts 🦅"

He later apologizes, and the two form a romantic relationship. He shows her an abandoned fire tower, and she gives him a necklace of a shell he found during their picnic, strung on rawhide. Despite her suspicions, she believes Chase's promises of marriage and consummates their relationship in a cheap motel room. After shopping for groceries one day, she reads in the paper of his engagement to another woman, and realizes that his promises of marriage were a ruse for sex. She ends their relationship. Tate, having graduated from college, visits Kya and is impressed by her expanded collection. He urges her to publish a reference book on seashells, and she does so under her full name. Jodie also returns in her life, expressing regret that he left her alone and breaking the news of their mother's death two years prior. Kya forgives her mother for leaving, but still cannot understand why she never returned. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز نخست ماه آگوست سال2019میلادیعنوان: جایی که خرچنگ‌ها آواز می‌خوانند (رمان)؛ نویسنده: دیلیا (دلیا) اونز؛ مترجم: آرتمیس مسعودی؛ تهران آموت‏‫، سال1397؛ در400ص؛ شابک9786003840867؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده21معنوان: ‏‫جایی که خرچنگ‌ها آواز می‌خوانند؛ نویسنده: دلیا اونز‮‏‫؛ مترجم: سارا کریمی؛ تهران نشر علمی‏‫، سال1398هجری خورشیدی؛ در406ص؛ شابک9789644044335؛عنوان: ‏‫جایی که خرچنگ‌ها آواز می‌خوانند‮‬‏‫؛ نویسنده: دلیا اوانز‮‏‫؛ مترجم محمدامین جندقیان‌بیدگلی؛ تهران انتشارات روزگار‫، سال1398؛ در418ص؛ شابک9786222330088؛جاییکه خرچنگ‌ها آواز می‌خوانند نوشته‌ ی: «دلیا اونز»، از پرفروش‌ترین آثار سالهای2018میلادی، و سال2019میلادی به شمار می‌رو��؛ داستان جنایی و جذاب دختری است، که اعضای خانواده‌ اش او را در سنین خردسالی رها کرده‌ اند، تا تنهایی، در دل طبیعت بکر «کارولینای شمالی»، با پدر کج خلقش زندگی کند؛ کتاب جاییکه خرچنگ‌ها آواز می‌خوانند؛ به مدت چهل و پنج هفته در بالای فهرست پرفروش‌ترین کتاب‌های جهان بوده است، و می‌تواند به افسانه‌ ای بی‌بدیل تبدیل شود؛ این رمان با قلب‌ خوانشگر بازی می‌کند، و موضوعی تازه در ترکیب انزوا و طبیعت، از دیدگاه یک بانوی نویسنده‌ است؛ ایشان داستان عشقی را روایت می‌کنند، که بیشتر حالت توفیق اجباری دارد؛ شاید نام «کیا» تنها سه حرف باشد، اما رنج‌هایی که او برگرده ی خویش کشیده، در روح و جسم هیچ دختری نمی‌گنجند؛ همگان از اهالی «بارکلی کو»، او را با لقب «دختر مرداب» می‌شناسند، دختر مردابی که نزدیک شدن او به سایر انسان‌ها تجربیات تلخ و شیرینی برایش به همراه دارد؛ رخدادهای پیچیده‌ ی بسیاری پیش و پس از پیدا شدن جسد معشوقه‌ ی پیشین او، رخ می‌دهند که «دلیا اونز» به زیبایی هرچه تمام‌تر، آن‌ها را می‌آراید؛ نویسنده در این رمان، که نخستین اثرش نیز به شمار است، هنر تصویرسازی خویش را به رخ خوانشگران می‌کشند؛ او با این داستان، به زیبایی هرچه تمام‌تر نشان می‌دهد، که انزوا چه تغییری در رفتار انسان‌ها، ایجاد می‌کندنقل نمونه از متن: (کلانتر جکسون گفت: «ورن»، این پرونده هنوز جای کار داره، اما بعضی چیزها جور درنمیان؛ همسر «چیس» و کارکنانش هنوز نمی‌دونن اون فوت کرده؛ دکتر «ورن مورفی» در جواب گفت: - «اد»، من بهشون می‌گم؛ - خیلی خوبه؛ ماشین من رو ببر؛ آمبولانس رو هم خبر کن تا بیاد جسد «چیس» رو ببره؛ اما درمورد این، با هیچ کسی صحبت نکن؛ من نمی‌خوام کسی از مردم روستا اینجا جمع بشن، و اگه تو این قضیه رو تعریف کنی، همه‌ ی نقشه‌ها برملا می‌شه؛ «ورن» قبل از اینکه تصمیم به رفتن بگیرد، چند دقیقه‌ ای به جسد «چیس» خیره شد، گویی چیزی را از قلم انداخته بود؛ به عنوان یک پزشک، او مجبور بود تمام شرایط را بررسی کند؛ اد به طرف بچه‌ها رفت و گفت: شما همین جا بمونید؛ دوست ندارم کسی توی شهر درباره ی این ماجرا صحبت کنه؛ در ضمن، دست یا پاهاتون رو توی جاهایی که گلیه، نگذارید، تا ردپا یا دست کسی ثبت نشه؛ «بنجی» گفت: - باشه؛ شما فکر می‌کنید یه نفر «چیس» رو کشته؟ درسته؟ چون هیچ ردپایی پیدا نکردید؛ شاید یه نفر اون رو اینجا رها کرده؟ - من همچین حرفی نزدم؛ این احتمالات قسمتی از کار پلیس‌هاست؛ حالا، توی دست و پا نیایید، و هر چیزی که اینجا شنیدید، به بقیه نگید؛ افسر «جو پوردو»، معاون کلانتر، یک مرد کوتاه قد با خط ریش‌های پهن، کمتر از پانزده دقیقه بعد، با ماشین گشت‌زنی در صحنه حاضر شد؛ - باورش برام سخته؛ «چیس» مُرده باشه؛ اون بهترین کارفرمایی بود که این شهر به خودش دیده؛ مرگ اون بعضی چیزها رو به هم می‌زنه؛ - حق با توئه؛ بیا بریم سراغ پرونده؛ - تا حالا چه چیزایی دستگیرتون شده؟ «اد» از بچه‌ها فاصله گرفت، و گفت: چیزی که شاید همه در ظاهر بگن، اینه که مرگ «چیس» یه تصادف بوده، و از اون بالا افتاده پایین؛ اما من تا این لحظه که دارم باهات صحبت می‌کنم، هیچ ردپایی از اون روی پله‌ها، یا گل‌ و لای‌ها ندیدم؛ بیا بررسی کنیم که آیا شواهدی در مورد صحنه‌ سازی این قتل وجود داره یا نه؛ دو مأمور قانون، حدود ده دقیقه منطقه را بررسی کردند؛ «جو» گفت: حق با تو بود؛ به غیر از ردپای اون بچه‌ها، هیچ چیزی دیگه‌ای دیده نمی‌شه.) پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 24/03/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 27/01/1401هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

I didn't know a sentence could hold so much.Yes, I'm aware that I'm sharing the very same quote that my bestie used for this book. But if a quote ever applied to a book...it's that one for this book.The story follows the ""Swamp girl"" or Kya throughout her life. And her life is not a pretty one. She was a very young girl when her abused mother had all she could stand one day and walked down the lane from their shack that last time. Left with her abusive father and brother Kya realizes that people don't stick when her brother also leaves. Left with her father Kya is forced to fend for herself in the North Carolina swamp.

Her father soons disappears from Kya's life also.Then she is befriended by a 'town boy' and he teaches Kya how to read. Kya has learned to only rely on herself so trusting someone is completely new to her.Then stuff happens. This little book is just so beautiful. It's written in a way that is almost poetic and still didn't get on my nerves. (I hates the poetry) It takes you to the lonely place of Kya's existance and makes you part of the swamp that she loves. It handles so many things much better than many other books have...prejudice and abuse..just to name a couple.All the stars.Female fireflies draw in strange males with dishonest signals and eat them; mantis females devour their own mates. Female insects, Kya thought, know how to deal with their lovers.

I really wasn't sure if this would be for me, but I ended up loving it, regardless of a few things that distracted me and parts I thought were highly improbable.Although there is a LOT going on in this one, I found it easy to follow.  I was very emotionally invested in Kya's story and had a few theories about what would become of her ~ All were wrong!Loved the blend of mystery, murder, wilderness, nature, and the last twist-

81,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4514828-susanne,Rating 4 out of 5,"4 Stars.A Haunting Tale of Resilience, Strength and Survival. The soul aches with the hardship and loneliness that permeates throughout much of “Where the Crawdads Sing.” If you’ve ever known what it feels like to be truly alone, this is a novel that will tear at you. Kya Clark is 7 years old when she is abandoned by every single member of her family, including her mother, thus becoming known as “The Marsh Girl.” Living in Barkley Cove, North Carolina, she learns to fend for herself in the wilderness, motoring her Pa’s boat, catching fish, bartering for gas and money for food. Before she knows it, she’s 18 years old. For a while, she dates Tate, who teaches her to read and who makes her feel whole, but then he leaves her too, just like everyone else. Thereafter, Kya dates Chase. It’s a whirlwind romance, though he never takes her out in public but makes promises of marriage and a home, all of which she believes, until she sees engagement photos of him and another girl in the local paper. How silly she has been to trust him. Years goes by, with Kya on her own, making a living by writing about her knowledge of the swamp, when a tragedy strikes and Kya is blamed. Kya, of course, has no idea how she will get through this as the Marsh is the only place that she has ever felt safe and now, even that has been taken away. Though “Where the Crawdads Sing” has an underlying message of hope, for me, Kya’s sadness is burned into my soul. Every moment she feels alone and/or she turns away from those who try to help her, I too, felt it and it brought me to tears.  I remember that feeling and reading Delia Owen’s words made my heart break in two. No one should ever feel that way and the author captured Kya’s feelings perfectly. Though sad, the writing here is exquisite and perfectly lyrical that it will haunt me for a long time to come. That being said, I did find certain elements of this story to be implausible, specifically, Kya’s ability to take care of herself at such a young age, to recall what her family did to survive and know how to do it all herself at the tender age of 7. I don’t know of any other 7 year olds who could have the wherewithal to take care of themselves anywhere (indoors), let alone out in the wild. Implausibility aside, this is a moving novel that tugs at heartstrings, makes you want to wrap your arms around this girl and tell her that she is not alone. Delia Owens words are gorgeous and this story captured my heart like no other. Thank you to Emily Fortner and Mimi Chan at Goodreads, Penguin Publishing Group G.P. Putnam's Sons for an complimentary copy of this novel to read and review.Published on Goodreads, Amazon and Twitter on 1.23.19.Excerpt to be published on Instagram."

However, all I can say about Reese Witherspoon’s recommendation of this book is “Thanks— you were right.” “Where the Crawdads Sing” sucks you into the story from the beginning as the author introduces the reader to the main character,Kya, as a young girl. Kya lives in an abusive home and circumstances cause her to basically raise herself by living off the land and scavenging. Although this might sound implausible, the author does a wonderful job putting the reader into the mind of Kya and soon you feel like you are living in the marsh with her. I found myself rooting for Kya to overcome all of her problems and to find happiness. Also, I must credit the author, her writing was beautiful ( much like early Anne Rivers Siddons). The mystery portion of the novel was also good but what the author didn’t tell the reader telegraphed what the final resolution to the mystery would be. That took away none of the enjoyment of the book for me, as the writing and character development was the best I have read since Pat Conroy. I hope Delia Owens has several more great books like this in her, if so she might just be the best Southern author writing today."

I'm going to settle for 4.5 stars!Drama, romance, mystery... I really liked the mix in this novel.Delia Owens wrote about characters who are going to stay with me (Kya, Jodie, Jumping and his wife... and Tate, my favorite!). They were all so human, they really touched me and I'm gonna remember their stories for a long time. I have to admit that there were ups and downs during my reading: some parts would deserve 5 stars while others bored me a little... All in all, I think 4.5 rounded down is fair for this really special book."

”The morning burned so August-hot, the marsh’s moist breath hung the oaks and pines with fog.”
Kya was only six years old on the day that she heard the screen door slap shut while she was scrubbing the grits out of the pot, and wondered who was leaving their shack. It couldn’t be her mother, her mother would have quietly closed the door, not let it slam shut on its own. She runs to the porch and sees her Ma in her long skirt and fake alligator high heels walking down the lane, carrying her train case. When she got to the end of the lane, she didn’t even turn to wave. Kya was the youngest, with Jodie being the closest in age to her, and three older siblings, Murph, Missy and Mandy. And Pa. But it isn’t long before the three oldest disappeared, almost old enough to make their own way in the world, and tired of Pa’s rages, the marks left on their bodies and their hearts. And then Jodie tells Kya that he has to leave, that he can’t live there, can’t take one more day of it. And Kya is left alone, more or less, with her Pa. A man who wanders off, not beholden to anyone to let them know when or if he will return, and when he does return he is almost always drunk.Barkley Cove, the town they live closest to eventually becomes determined that Kya should attend school, and so she is made to go, is escorted to the school, where the other children taunt her, tease her, and she never returns. Kya is branded, they called her the Marsh Girl, a label meant to mark her an outcast, but Kya is happier without them. She finds her family and friends in the gulls, and the shells she collects. She is sensitive to the lessons she learns from the waters and the land, the birds that come morning and night to be fed, trusting that she will always be there to feed them. Where this book excels is in the descriptions of her surroundings, there are so many moments in this story where the picture she paints is so beautifully true to this part of North Carolina’s coast, and most likely even more true in the 1950s. For me, the story felt as if it became a little bit bogged down in the last half of the book, where a mystery is being solved / resolved.A lovely reflection of the beauty that surrounds us in nature, in the still natural places in this world that man has not conquered or spoiled, and the nature within a young girl, a lyrical coming of age tale that feels as wild and promising as Kya’s world.

I’m quite fascinated that Owens managed to write a debut novel consisting of multiple genres. We have non-fiction from the nature and animal information, mystery, romance and I suppose historical fiction as well. Color me impressed!I thought this book was so beautifully and elegantly written and as a nature and animal enthusiast, I loved each and every scene pertaining to the marsh, animals, insects and nature in general. As for the twists near the end-I was all for them! 🙌🏼I would recommend this to anyone who has a deep love for the natural world as well as those who like mystery with little to no gore. 4.5 ⭐️ but I am going to round down as some scenes dragged a little and I found my mind wandering at times.

The beauty of this book is in the descriptive writing which takes you on a journey through the Marshy Swamps of North Carolina. The character of Kyla Clarke abandoned and rejected by her family near stole my heart and this is a character that will stay with me for quite some time.This is beautiful quiet novel, set in Berkeley Cove a small town on the North Carolina coast, elegant with that southern charm that draws you in, suspensful and unique plot and just a good back to basic mystery that is charming and a real page turner.I listened to this novel on audio and what a treat to enjoy those Southern accents which really added to the enjoyment of this novel. I had reason to stop over for one night a few weeks ago in Charlotte North Carlolina and how I wish I had been able to spend a week here and explore this state and after reading this book I really want to book a flight and enjoy that southern charm.I learned so much about the marsh and its wildlife in this novel and lovers of nature and the outdoors are going to really enjoy this one."

Yet somehow, she survives and lives symbiotically with nature.And while she is anything but wild, taught by a fish catching boy how to read and write, the towns folk believe she is a marsh girl; pretty much a simpleton raised in the wild, not realizing she is a more intelligent being than the folks who put her down. When a death of a townsman takes place in the marsh, all eyes turn to her as being the prime suspect.Vivid characters and an abundance of wild life.What a delight in learning about what one man deems as swampy and unworthy; another one gleams at the joy of the intricate Ecosystem that is brimming and humming with life.Sort of reminds of the Great Alone.5⭐️ for it had a surprising ending and damn it if I didn’t want it to end!

Amazing!!A swamp and a marsh are very different environments. A marsh is a thriving and nurturing place, and it's there, along the North Carolina coast, that Kya lived and survived after being abandoned by her family as a young girl. Kya spent her days alone, observing the surrounding natural world, and it served her well. Though she loved her marsh dearly, sometimes the loneliness was too much, especially as she grew into a young women. But after being abandoned by everyone she loved and shunned by the locals, who could she trust with her heart?I don't want to ramble on too much about the plot. This stirring, character-driven novel is part coming of age story, part mystery, and part love story — between Kya and two young men who she allows in her hidden world, but most of all, between Kya and her treasured marsh. WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING is a gorgeously written and haunting novel with an unforgettable heroine, the Marsh Girl. What a bittersweet ending!! Tears, tears, tears. Just lovely.

The first part of the book was my favorite, when Kya was abandoned. She starts to be even more attuned to nature and learns how to survive on her own.Her young crush on Tate is also very well done. When the story began to unravel for me was the introduction of Chase and his murder. I felt like the author took on too much and tried to arrange a tidy end to a story that could have been reconciled quite differently. I hated the trial and thought it dragged on forever and tried my patience. The epilogue was not needed either. I felt betrayed by the surprise tucked in to the ending and felt it negated all the good that had come before."

There are several genres of books that I avoid deliberately: Fantasy, Science Fiction, Horror, Erotica, Young Adult and Romance. This, from the blurb for ""Where the Crawdads Sing"", made me wince a little: ""… a heartbreaking coming-of-age story..."".. Also, if I might quote from Dianne's (3 star) review: ""I am definitely in the minority here … but it had a “women’s literature” flavour to me that I don’t personally care for."" I felt much the same way pretty much from the start.@40% - After listening to a well-narrated 40% of “Where The Crawdads Sing”, and allowing for the introduction of a murder mystery that should increase its attraction for me, I think this novel will probably be a disappointment for me. @50% - I also think the story has credibility problems. (No Spoilers): Kya's mother leaves, then her siblings, then her father, who might as well be considered as having left altogether. Kya is only 6-7 years old and she survives living by the swamp, all by herself? @60% - DNF Addendum 20 October 2018I know I do not have to justify my decision not to finish ""Where The Crawdads Sing”, but I think it is worth adding that I did try to read this book in full. After all, it is the overwhelming favourite of almost 2,000 reviewers and has been awarded almost 12,000 ratings with an average of 4.56.

96,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25976435-tudor-queen,Rating 5 out of 5,"Thank you to Penguin Publishing Group who provided an advance reader copy via Edelweiss.This is a very special book about a girl named Catherine Danielle Clark (known as Kya) who lived in a shack in the Marsh lands of North Carolina. The story begins in 1952 when at the tender age of six, Kya's mom walked out of her life, never turning her head back to wave goodbye. As the days passed, her older siblings gradually left as well, leaving Kya alone to deal with her volatile father. Pa would leave the shack for days on end, then suddenly reappear without warning. Eventually, even he left for good. This left fourteen year old Kya to fend for herself. However, this very clever and resourceful girl drew upon memories of watching Mom cook and clean, and navigating the motor boat with her Dad. When Kya's Dad was still at home and she could spend a little money, a barefoot Kya roamed the aisles of the local Piggly Wiggly market to buy grits. However, once Dad abandoned her, Kya's survival instincts kicked in. Remembering a skill Mom taught her, Kya collected mussels when the tide was low. Filling two large bags, she boated to Jumpin's Gas and Bait to barter her first deal of mussels in exchange for money and gas (for the motor boat). Compassionate to the little girl's plight, Jumpin' and his wife Mabel donated care packages of clothing and other necessities as needed. Besides these friendships, Kya's only other friends were the treasured birds and animals of the Marsh. That is, until she met Tate. Tate was out boating at the same time as Kya when she lost direction. Tate kindly directed Kya home, and this was the first dawning of their relationship. Over time, they shared their love of nature (such as collecting various bird feathers) and he even taught Kya to read. Kya was known as ""The Marsh Girl"", a mysterious and undesirable being to be avoided. She only spent one day in school after being treated as an outcast. Used to being abandoned and now comfortable in her self-imposed isolation, Kya set about painting in watercolors marsh lifeforms, such as mushrooms, seabirds and grasses. Now that she could read, she could both document and illustrate her love of nature. This story also revolves around a possible murder, that of Chase Andrews. His body was discovered by two boys in 1969, and the mystery of his death and his involvement with Kya is a slowly unfolding drama in the book. Through alternating time periods, Kya's life and the truth of Chase Andrews' death weave an atmospheric, poignant and totally engaging story. Many thanks to my Goodreads friend Dorie whose beautiful review directed me to this fine book."
97,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56035852-katie,Rating 2 out of 5,"I don't read very quickly. I have a lot of time to think about what I'm reading. I think the quicker one reads the more immersed one becomes in a novel and the less critical, like watching a film. I'm much less critical of films. I'll watch stuff I wouldn't read in a million years. I might enjoy the film of this but the book consisted of too much artifice and not enough reality for me.It quickly became apparent that much of the narrative didn't ring true, everything was exaggerated, and you had to read it as a kind of fairy story. I didn't mind this to begin with. But structurally it was messy. Chapter two jumps forward in time. A suspected murder is quickly introduced to feed in some tension. These alternate chapters after the murder became more and more flimsy and bereft of purpose. Then there's a YA fairy tale romance which just isn't my kind of thing. I get irritated by books that remind me how cynical I can be. And this had my cynicism bubbling on the hob. The author's ability to write about the natural world is where she excels. The depiction of the marshlands was seductive and sexy. Her understanding of people on the other hand felt cartoonish, like that of a child. Her characters are fairy story exemplary in a world where everyone else is rotten to the core. I was going to give this an indifferent three stars until the interminable trial and the wholly implausible case against our heroine. I felt like this was written according to some formula of how to write a best selling novel. Certainly worked on that score.

99,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26385554-deborah,Rating 1 out of 5,"Wow, how can so many readers rave about this book? I thought it was just awful. It took me every minute of the two weeks I had it on loan to get to the end. I don't know why I stuck with it as it was painful every time I picked it up; maybe I was in the mood for masochism. So what's wrong with it? Well, for one thing, every page was screaming at me, ""This is sad. So sad. SO SAD!!!"" I have a strong bias against books that I feel are emotionally manipulating me. As soon as I started reading about The Marsh Girl, I was reminded of 'Beasts of the Southern Wild,' a wonderful story of a little girl living alone with her sick father in the swamps. Mother gone, dad drinks too much and frequently disappears, both try to avoid the bad, bad authorities, and both love the natural environment even though it causes hardships--but that's where the similarity ends. 'Where the Crawdads Sing' should hope to be a tenth as good (but it isn't). It also can't decide whether it is a coming of age story or a murder mystery; the chapters jump between telling the story of Kya's life and the investigation of a murder for which she is later tried. And those trial scenes were the absolute most hackneyed that I have ever read. Old Perry Mason scripts were better. Secondary character--with the exception of Jumpin', a black man who runs a tiny gas station/convenience store that serves boaters, and his wife Mabel, are total stereotypes. 1) Jordie, the helpful older brother who quickly disappears, leaving Kya alone with 2) the drunken, abusive dad who isn't all bad when he's sober. 3) The Good Boy, Tate, who becomes Kya's only friend, and 4) The Bad Boy, Chase, the seduce-and-abandon type. 5) The cocky police chief and 6) his cocky assistant and 7) the cocky prosecutor. As to the writing: I love nature as much as the next person, but the writing in the long, long, tedious, repetitive passages describing shells and sea gulls and bird feathers and fireflies were, in my opinion, just plain bad (but not as bad as the trial chapters).I could go on, but just--ugh.

I really grew to love the main character so much and her character arc was amazing. This book also follows a murder mystery and by the end I was shocked, as I didn’t predict that ending at all! The only reason this wasn’t 5 stars is because with literary fiction, I can find the beginning to be slow and hard for me to get through. However, by part 2, I was fully invested and very much enjoyed. I can definitely understand why this book is so popular! I also did a review of this book in a reading vlog on my YouTube Channel.

101,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59458347-petrik,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5/5 starsWhere the Crawdads Sing is a book that’s massively praised worldwide, and it lives up to all the hype. It doesn’t matter whether you read literary fiction or not, if you’ve visited Amazon or a bookstore in 2019, it’s quite likely that you’ve heard about Where the Crawdads Sing, Delia Owens’s FIRST novel that’s praised and hit bestseller everywhere. Honestly, I didn’t expect to read this one; my girlfriend and my co-blogger—Celeste—highly recommended it to me even though they know that it’s well outside my usual genre—SFF—of novels to read. However, the immensely high average ratings made the book a must-try for me. At the time of writing this review, it has an average of 4.5 stars out of 463k ratings on Goodreads, and on Amazon US it has an average rating of 4.8 out of 27.3k ratings/reviews! To make things even crazier, this is the author’s FIRST novel, and everything about it lives up to the hype.

“I wasn't aware that words could hold so much. I didn't know a sentence could be so full.” 

Where the Crawdads Sing follows the coming-of-age story of Kya, who’s also known as the Marsh girl. The book itself is a great mix of coming-of-age and murder mystery. The coming-of-age story starts in 1952, and the murder mystery of Chase Andrews begins in 1969. The narrative juggles the two timeframes constantly, slowly connecting two different timelines and genre towards each other with the progression of each chapter. When Kya’s coming-of-age story eventually converges with the murder mystery aspect, the tension of the book was heightened up to the state of the book being practically unputdownable. I believe that this is a book that will, or should I say already, be a hit for many readers across all genres. I read this on an impulse because I’m looking for a great standalone, and I got what I wanted.

“She knew the years of isolation had altered her behavior until she was different from others, but it wasn't her fault she'd been alone. Most of what she knew, she'd learned from the wild. Nature had nurtured, tutored, and protected her when no one else would.”

I can confidently say that a HUGE part of why I enjoyed reading this book immensely was due to how well-written the characters were. Loneliness, a life in isolation, friendship, nature, and finding connections were some of the central themes in Where the Crawdads Sing; the characters brought these themes to life. At one or two points in your lifetime, there will be moments where you feel like you’re alone, and you end up craving acceptance from a group of friends or community because of it. We humans often seek connections, and we often suffer from loneliness. Kya’s coming-of-age story teaches readers about how brutally painful a life in isolation can be. There’s a lot of resonating lessons that can be earned by reading Kya’s story; loving yourself comes first, and it’s okay to have only one, two, or a few loyal friends rather than being in a group you forced yourself to be included in. Kya’s interaction with each different side characters throughout the novel was just so well done; every dialogue, with the addition of Kya’s internalizations, fleshed out the characters further. Kya wasn’t the singular character I cared for; both Tate and Jumpin ended up becoming two other characters I loved. These aren’t flawless characters; they’re flawed, they make mistakes, they learned from their regrets, and I enjoyed reading about them.

“His dad had told him many times that the definition of a real man is one who cries without shame, reads poetry with his heart, feels opera in his soul, and does what’s necessary to defend a woman.”

There were a few small sections that took some time to get used to such as the accents spoken by some of the characters during their dialogues, and the author’s insertion of poetry into the storyline. I love poetic prose, but admittedly, real poetry doesn’t click with me as often as I prefer. However, the author’s prose remained engaging throughout the plot, and it’s seriously astounding that this is her first published novel. Every part of this novel was compelling to read, and whether it’s the coming-of-age or the murder mystery sections, I was captivated effortlessly. Plus, although Kya’s character development is the most dominant narrative, I loved that the mystery aspect left me constantly guessing. 

“Let’s face it, a lot of times love doesn’t work out. Yet even when it fails, it connects you to others and, in the end, that is all you have, the connections. Look at us; you and I have each other now, and just think, if I have kids and you have kids, well, that’s a whole new string of connections.”

Where the Crawdads Sing is a beautifully immersive, gripping, and important book. It celebrates books, literature, friendship, family, love, and passion. Owens prioritized these humane themes without forgetting the important necessity of nature in our life, and it’s all so wonderfully done. Readers will remember Kya and the life she lives as a Marsh Girl; I recommend this book to every reader, simple as that.You can order the book from: Book Depository (Free shipping)You can find this and the rest of my reviews at Novel Notions"

The authors writing of nature and using it as a metaphor and descriptor was absolutely exquisite. I love Kya as a character and I really hope the new film does this book justice.5*****This has such beautiful writing with some poems interwoven through out (which I loved). Kya is a character I adored and was enamoured by her. The marsh descriptions were so wonderful that you can easily muster up the scene and they seemed almost touchable. The last third of this book had me absolutely gripped!

I may write a more in depth review at a later day but just wanted to say that I loved this book. I loved reading about strong, creative, Kya and I also liked that even though the book was telling the story mostly from Kya's viewpoint, that the author would still give us insight into what others were thinking. This was the author's debut novel and I hope to read more from her in the future. "

At the same time, the print and audio arrived for me from my library. So I started the audio. At first, I didn't care for it. I love the audio narrator Cassandra Campbell but I felt her voice too soothing, too light. I thought the narration should be more gritter, hard-edged. After some time, I grew to enjoy the narration. I got sucked in and wanted to listen to more. In the end, I switched to the print. I was in a room with my husband while he was watching TV and I had to know how it ended, so the print it was. Both were equally enjoyable.Now....the story. Very interesting, very sad but not shocking. I couldn't help thinking of To Kill a Mockingbird while reading this one. Maybe it was the ol' South, the silly prejudices of small-minded folks, the whole mock of a trial all got me thinking of TKAM and some of the similarities. (Must say, TKAM is my all-time favorite book though.) This one tells the story of 'The Marsh Girl', a 10 year old girl abandoned by everyone, but learning to survive on her own. And what did she get in return, scorn and anger from anyone that she came across. We follow her journey from a young girl until the end......but I don't want to say more and ruin this one for others.Overall, I'm glad I read this one. Will it end up on my top 10 for the year.....probably not. Maybe I was influenced by all the wonderful reviews and expected so much more. I do know, that it has pushed me to read my all time favorite book again. And that's what reading books is all about. And now, on to my next read."

This may be my most unpopular opinion of all time… but I was so bored during this entire book. I can see why so many people love it but it just wasn’t for me. I adored Kya & I really loved how this ended, but that’s about it. The whole first half was setting the scene and it bored me half to death, I almost didn’t finish. The second half was a little more interesting, but it wasn’t until the last couple chapters that I was actually intrigued. The ending is the only thing that I enjoyed, and even that was predictable for me.. maybe I watch too much criminal minds? again.. i’m so sorry. I was lowkey scared to post this review."

I loved this story and it made for a fantastic discussion. Fifteen Traveling Friends joined in on this discussion and quite a few of us have added this one to our favorites list.Where the Crawdads Sing is a compelling, insightful and original well-layered coming of age story that also digs deep into the environment surrounding this story. It is so stunning and vividly written not only in the descriptive atmosphere but also with the insightful way it is written. We meet our main character Kya at a young age and learn how she becomes isolated from the people and world around her. This part of the story brought on a bit of discussion for us and some of us struggled a bit here with suspending some disbelief here. However, this is also where the magic of the story and the marsh comes alive.In our discussion, we talked about how the marsh became so many different things to Kya allowing us to see some comparisons and symbolization between nature and human behavior. We became totally immersed in the vivid setting of the marsh and it was like the story was being told and shown to us by it. We felt like we were drawn into the mind of a character. We could feel how hauntingly isolating yet peaceful it was to Kya. We could see just how dangerous that was for Kya when the outside world becomes apart of Kya’s marsh. The writing here is so vivid and made this such a stunning story for some us, however, there were a couple sisters who found it dense and at times myself included became a bit weary of it.We highly recommend this truly amazing story with such an unforgettable character.For more thoughts from The Traveling Sisters in this group read please follow this link! https://travelingsistersbookreviews.c..."
108,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/80033559-kylie-d,Rating 5 out of 5,"Deeply moving and poignant, Where The Crawdads Sings is a coming of age tale like no other. Abandoned by her family as a small child, and shunned by society, Kya, the so-called 'Marsh Girl' grows up on her own on the fringes of society. With few friends, she gets by with the company of the marsh and sea birds that surround her home. One day Kya chances across Tate, a friend of her long lost brother, who takes her under his wing and teaches her to read, opening up a whole new world for her. Years later another young man from the town, Chase, is found dead at the bottom of an old fire tower, and suspicion immediately falls on 'The Marsh Girl'.A touching tale, Delia Owens tells a emotional story of an outcast, who the townspeople rally against because she is 'different'. This is a book to savour as Kya grows up amongst nature, surviving in her own way. The setting in the marsh comes alive as we befriend the birds, fish, and hunt for shells and mussels with Kya. She is a tragic figure, but has an amazing inner strength about her. A truly memorable character. This is bound to be one of my best reads of the year, and one I will never forget."

It’s a deeply emotional, bittersweet, and heart breaking coming-of-age story that centers around a young girl, Kya, growing up in a remote shack in the marshes of North Carolina. She’s dismissed as white trash by the inhabitants of the local town, and abandoned by her family and everyone she’s ever cared about. The story of her growing up on her own from the age of 10, with only the swamp birds to relieve her devastating loneliness, is intercut with an investigation years later into the murder of the town’s asshole jock, and Kya’s eventual trial for his murder. The book will rip your heart into a million pieces."

A gorgeous and heart wrenching historical fiction with a coming of age story and murder mystery intertwined to make an utterly compelling read.
Happy to say that this was my first 5 star read of the year and I couldn’t be more annoyed that I left it this long to read- if there’s a book on your bookshelf just staring at you to be read – trust your instinct and just pick it up!It took me approximately 10 pages to realise that this would become an all time favourite read and would completely destroy me. The story was incredibly captivating from the off – the author painted such a vividly colourful backdrop to the story you felt like you were genuinely there amongst the nature and the marsh. Definitely one of my favourite aspects of the novel; seeing Kya’s connection with nature and wildlife and how in many ways it was the only thing she could rely on to be a constant in her life.It was incredibly hard to read about Kya’s family situation and the abuse that her and her family had to endure. The way it was portrayed felt incredibly real and hard hitting as it’s a very sensitive subject for me personally and I think the author did a wonderful job in putting across the trauma and emotions that come with it. You could feel Kya’s loneliness throughout the entire book and I definitely welled up a fair few times when it felt like there was really no one there for her.Her solitude was so overwhelming that the first interaction in the book between her and Tate felt so intimate even though it was nothing more than eye contact. Watching her relationship unfold and unravel with Tate over the course of the book gave me so much happiness and then in quick succession a lot of sadness; you could truly feel the love, warmth and heartbreak between them both. It was great to see Tate give Kya the attention, education and companionship that she had never received from her family and it eventually leading to her growth, her career and her being able to put food on the table for herself. He gave her the tools to blossom into what she was destined to be. We’re given a little insight from Kya’s brother into her childhood and it becomes clear that Tate was protecting her before she even knew he was.It was so lovely to see how Jumpin and Mabel supported Kya from a young age, even when it was from a distance. Mabel was the only mother figure Kya had in her life and it was highlighted by key events in Kya’s adolescence just how much she relied on her. The scene where Jumpin displays Kya’s book in his window was one of the most poignant scenes in the whole book for me; it confirmed that not only did Kya love and need them, but they were so proud of her too.It was sad to see Kya attempting to find what she was missing from Tate through Chase. Ultimately, she not only ended up emotionally hurt but physically too. I don’t know if I’m alone here (I’m probably alone here), but the court scenes and Kya’s lawyer very much gave me ‘To Kill A Mockingbird’ and Atticus Finch vibes. Perhaps it was the fact it was a historical fiction and in a similar setting or maybe you could just smell injustice through the pages. There were a lot of prejudices towards Kya aka ‘The Marsh Girl’ from everyone in town even though nobody had actually given her the time of day to get to know her.Having her brother come back and find her was so bittersweet. She always felt like he would come back to her so it was nice to see him do that, however he also came with the sad news that that would never be a possibility for her mother to do the same.By the time I was finished reading this book I was in bits. One of those where you set the book down and just stare into space for a while contemplating what to even do next. I’m incredibly happy with the direction the book went in and it was great to see Kya finally get some companionship and love with the person she was meant to be with. This book is one that will be hard to forget."

 by Demi LovatoWHAT AN INCREDIBLE STORY!!!KYA IS MY SPIRIT ANIMAL. AND THIS IS MY NEW ALL TIME FAVORITE BOOK!!!I woke up at six this Thursday morning, and I stayed in bed for approximately eight hours listening to this book. Yes, I’m not kidding, and I can totally get into the lost in stories, time don’t exist mode should the occasion arises.Criticisms that my other self tries to reason me into not being such a WEEPY EMOTIONAL HOT MESS over this book BUT that 
I
 don’t give two effs about because I just LOVE IT SO MUCH I’d do anything for Kya:(1) I don’t care that at it’s core this is just a “girl from the wrong side of tracks” story. ---> NO! This is a story of survival of the fittest; nature vs. nurture; the beautiful, the bad, and the ugly sides of love and loneliness; and the true strength of women.(2) I don’t care that I had to try HARD to suspend my disbelief at the beginning because I couldn’t deal with the fact that a six year old child was left alone to fend for herself. ---> If there’s such thing as a miracle, Kya is it. She is hope, and she is inspiration.(3) I don’t care that this book is slow moving, and those insertion of poems are annoying at times. ---> Shame on you for not being able to appreciate the beauty of the wildlife this book so perfectly captures! And so what? Not everyone likes poetry. Myself included.I didn’t know a lick about this book, except that it was widely known and there was a mystery in it. I also thought this was going to be a literary fiction about black racial injustices. So, for a while I thought Kya was African American. No, she’s white, but there are POC characters.In addition, I was pleasantly surprised there was a romantic storyline in it too. The romance is perfect if you’re fans of Nicholas Sparks books or the novel 
Archer's Voice
 and 
Savaged
 by Mia Sheridan. Meanwhile, the mystery is for those who enjoy courtroom thrillers.As you can tell from how engrossed I was, this book is highly atmospheric and immersive. The combination of the two romance and mystery might not be to everyone’s taste, but it is to mine. I was transfixed. Bewitched. Mesmerized. This book is so me.I’m not going to tell you to read this because frankly I don’t care if you do or not. This book has become personal to me. *wipes tears and blows runny nose* I’m sooo excited for the movie adaptation. I know I can trust Reese Witherspoon to make the best film out of it.

112,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49444196-katie-b,Rating 4 out of 5,"Pretty close to the beginning I felt an emotional attachment to the main character, Kya Clark aka Marsh Girl. It was hard not to given her mother left when she was a little girl, followed by her siblings and her father basically left her to fend for herself. I couldn't help but want to give the poor girl a hug. The author does an amazing job of painting a picture of the North Carolina marsh area where Kya lives. The story switches back and forth between Kya growing up in the 1950s and the late 1960s when a man is found dead. The mystery of whether the man was murdered or not wasn't really the highlight of the book as I much preferred watching Kay grow as a character. I'd definitely recommend this book if you are looking for a novel with good character development and an emotional reading experience.

Στα έιτιζ λοιπόν, μετακινούμασταν μέσα σε αυτοκίνητα ντουμανιασμένα με καπνό και κλειστά παράθυρα, ούτε λόγος για παιδικά καθισματάκια, οι μανάδες στα νεύρα τους πετούσαν καμία παντόφλα, μας έπαιρναν στα ξενύχτια τους και όταν νυστάζαμε ένωναν δύο καρέκλες και αποκοιμιόμασταν με ένα σακάκι για κουβέρτα.

First it was a tale of a broken family from a backwater town. Then it was a tale of survival mixed in with a police procedural. Then it was a romance intermixed with a courtroom drama. Then it was an extended epilogue which for me ruined the only earlier scene that actually impacted me emotionally when Kya can't be comforted after the trial. I think if it focused on just the family/survival/romance/redemption and further developed that, than I would have been much happier. I mean, Tate does 180s out of nowhere, twice! I'm going to be with you forever you can count on me even though I am going away for college but I will be back. Ok now I am back visiting our hometown but I have decided you now don't fit in with my life so I will completely ghost you and won't even talk to you for several years even though I know you have been abandoned by absolutely everyone. Now I am done with college and I've decided it's the biggest regret of my life not being with you. It didn't make sense except as a specific plot choice for the author so that the whole murder/court story line could come into play. This review makes it sound like I really disliked this book, and I didn't. I read the whole thing in one day, so it definitely had it's merits. Also, almost everyone else on my GR friend list who read this loved it, so feel free to ignore me."

You know you read a book that will stay with you forever, has find it's place on your ""favourite shelf"" before you even finish, and you can't find anything that can be compared to it.

The one, if it was happening in real life, Ben Fogle wouldn't miss a chance to witness.The story follows Kya who, ever since she was a little girl, survives on her own, surrounded with nature near the marsh.Observing the nature, she also compares it to life and people she is familiar with.I learned so many new things from this book, and I am very greatful for it.The beautiful writing style is astonishing and uncoperable to anything I've read before.The writer captured nature in all it's rawness and beauty and she also managed to show the beauty and the ugliness of people.This book touched me dearly, made me care for some characters and hate some too, and what I appreciate the most, it opened my mind to new things and also made me laugh out loud while I was reading a science article about frogs.One of my friends said this is maybe the best book she has read in her life. Now, when I also read it, I umderstand her statement and couldn't agree more."
116,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26560207-gabby,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5 starsOkay so this book is good but it's also a bit over-hyped in my opinion. I know everyone and their mom loves the shit out of this book, and while I enjoyed it, I definitely had some issues with it. To be fair though, historical fiction isn't my favorite genre. This is a story that takes place in the 1950's through the 70's about this young girl named Kya who is abandoned by her family and is forced to survive on her own in the marsh. The locals begin to refer to her as the marsh girl and reject her from society. Let's start with the positives. 1) The way this book describes loneliness is spot on and heart breaking. The writing is gorgeous and some of those quotes about loneliness were very heartbreaking and sad and made me feel so much for Kya. I loved the use of poetry in this story and using it to describe nature. It was written very vividly and gorgeous. 2) I loved the feminist message in this book about believing women and supporting women when something bad happens to them. It was hard to read about all the drama between Chase Andrews and Kya, but it was also sad knowing the town and the police wouldn't believe Kya because she was the crazy Marsh girl and he was this beloved football player in the town. This is so relevant and so important in our times. 3) I love love love the very last page. It was a beautiful wrap up to the story and it shouldn't have ended any other way. 4) Tate and Kya's relationship was the softest, cutest thing. Tate definitely had his flaws but they were cute. 5) This felt very To Kill a Mockingbird at times with its message of not being prejudice when it comes to a court case and trial and basing it off the facts. 6) I love Kya's descriptions of feeling like she's giving a piece of herself away every time she interacts with someone else. As an introvert myself I found a lot of her inner dialogue totally relatable. ""Life had made her an expert at mashing feelings into a storable size."" / ""Their togetherness tugged at her loneliness."" / ""Loneliness has a compass of its own."" 
""Tate remembered his dad's definition of a man: one who can cry freely, feel poetry and opera in his heart, and do whatever it takes to defend a woman.""
However, while I did love some of this book, I also had a lot of problems with it. 1) The pacing. The pacing of this book is all over the place, I thought the beginning was super slow and it took me 100 pages to get into the story, then the middle finally picked up and became super interesting, and then the ending was so freaking rushed... like it jumped ahead years and years and decades within pages and I was like whaaaat? 2) The YA-feel love triangle I was not a fan of the love triangle going on between Kya and Tate and Chase. The scenes had me rolling my eyes and I found myself skimming the romantic scenes between Kya and Chase and bleh. 3) The believably of this story. This is going to dive into some spoilers so: I find it incredibly hard to believe that Kya would just instantly get published. That came out of nowhere in the book I feel like. And I find it hard to believe the entire town besides Jumpin and Mabel would reject Kya, a little girl without a family... like come on don't you think somebody would step up and help her out? Idk the whole thing seemed pretty unbelievable for me. 4) Some parts toward the end got a little cheesy. I felt like it was one of those things where the author was trying so hard to make you cry. We just get all these random moments over a period of years like Tate proposing, and Jumpin dying, and then Kya dying and it all felt so over the top... idk I think I was supposed to be crying but I wasn't cause it felt like the author was trying so hard to make me feel sad. I also thought the court scenes at the end of this book were long and tedious.I don't know I guess I went into this with way too high of expectations and everyone saying this is their favorite book of 2018 and all that. This was a good book, but it wasn't as good as the hype had led me to believe sadly."
117,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/116523065-unknown-reviews,Rating 2 out of 5,"At the time, I’m writing this review, Where the Crawdads Sing has a 4.5 star average across nearly 900,000 ratings. And for the life of me, I can’t work out why.“Where the Crawdads Sing” centers around the life of Kya, a woman who, at the age of six, was abandoned by her family. As she learns the ways of wilderness and survival, two men are beguiled by her beauty and seek to court her. So when one of them shows us dead in 1969, town locals immediately expects Kya to be the culprit, otherwise known as “The Marsh Girl.” But is Kya really the myth they believe her to be? Based on that summary, you may assume this is about a girl being caught up in a love triangle which evolves into a murder mystery. By all admittance, the blurb reads as a YA novel. However, I found both romance and mystery lacked in this story immensely. This is nearly four hundred pages of nature descriptions and Kya’s laments regarding love, loneliness, nature, and poetry.As expected, the writing and prose are beautiful, though I couldn’t help laughing at my cluelessness regarding the nature similes. I just have to take Owens word for it that they made sense. But even with nice-sounding words strung well together, it didn’t seem particularly unique or as vivid as I wanted it to be. A lot of this book was description of nature, clothes, food, more clothes. I think after reading an unusually good streak of well-written books this year, my standards have been elevated. I felt I was being floated along gently as I read the words, without being given any images that were particularly captivating, a shame considering the unusual North Carolina setting.I also enjoyed Kya’s reflections on mating in animals and humans. I wish Owens had gone more into depth into man vs. nature, since these were the most interesting parts of the book. This what was I expected coming into the book (a story about fireflies was incredibly intriguing). Unfortunately, these came up rarer and rarer as the book went on. The characters  were very flat and one-dimensional.  This goes for everyone. I don’t think I’d advertise Kya as a Manic Pixie Girl, but she lacked flaws. At seven, she learns how to provide everything for herself unusually quickly. She goes to school for one day and is like ""nope, this isn't for me."" She can only speak a few words, until someone teaches her to read and she becomes a bona fide genius in the span of thirty pages. I was also wondering, how, on her bad diet, did she never become ill or need a doctor? I really just wished Owens had bumped up her age a small bit. I don't think a six/seven year old could raise themselves in a swamp.Okay, maybe I can suspend my disbelief for these points despite it being a contemporary novel. But even take those away, I don’t know who Kya really is. She’s niceish? She likes nature a lot. She felt very passive without a distinct personality. Even her musings on loneliness felt very much like Owens remembered she needed to insert it in to correlate with her themes. It was too telling, most of this book. Had Kya been someone more primal, wilder than she turned out to be, I may have liked her more. But in Owens attempt to make her “unique” or “different”, she seems as normal as everyone else. She can talk, read, do everything as well as anyone in the modern world could. If you think this book is about a teenage girl who’s completely isolated in the wild, it’s not. It seems Owens teetered between “should I make her wild,” or “should I make her a normal girl.” I think the former was supposed to be what she was aiming for, otherwise the conclusion of the book feels very uncharacteristic. I’ve seen someone float up “we’re as much strangers to Kya as the town’s people are!” No, that’s an absolutely lazy and far-reaching way to explain bad writing. When your protagonist is a normal girl for all the book, you can’t suddenly pretend she’s not. The love interests were shockingly bad . Remember when I said the blurb sounded like a YA novel? Well, it’s not YA, but the lover interests have been plucked from a weak YA book. We have Tate and Chase.  Tate  is the nerdy, caring, unerringly kind boyfriend who respects Kya and knows she’s the only girl he’ll ever be in love with. So much so, he has to diss every other female to his father.  Tate said, “The girls at school are silly. All they talk about is hair and high heels.   “She’s more pure and innocent than any of those girls you’d have me go to the dance with.” Tate is around eighteen at this time, and he never grows out of this mindset. The “not like other girls” book is a hatred trope in YA book, a sore attempt of the author telling us his/her main character “Special” and “Unique” when the writing doesn’t show it. Besides that, his love for Kya is annoyingly firm. For the rest of the book, he remains her obedient dog, never once having an ounce of characterisation outside Kya’s existence. Finally, he was going to go back to find her, tell her he never stopped loving her and beg her to forgive him.  This love isn’t enough to motivate him when he decides to leave her for a long period of time. His actions  don’t make sense  after how infatuated he’s supposed to be with her. Even the character doesn’t know why he didn’t return to her for so long. There’s no reason. Oh wait, there is.  Chase  With Chase, I expected a love interest more fleshed out than Tate. Someone who initially liked Kya for her looks, and then realised there was a lot more to her. Nope. Instead he remains a narcissistic jock who strings everyone around (I’m actually tired of that trope too. The people who played sports in my school were for the most part kind and fun to be with.) Chase has  no redeeming features.  I'm not even sure why he was in the novel.This book is not a romance novel. This book is about Kya’s journey. So, I’m not sure why it was marketed as “two boys fall in love with girl.” I genuinely wonder is there any reader who found these love interests convincing because they didn’t get what they were sold. No-one in this book is three-dimensional. Jumpin’ and Mabel are two kind of caregivers for Kya, giving her clothes and fuel. There likeable for their actions, but otherwise not real. Her relationship with them literally shows she wasn’t alone, but the book keeps trying to sell her off like she is.So much of the dialogue is stilted and expositional, especially one scene where Kya reunites with someone from her past. I think the worst offenders may be the sheriff and his partner trying to solve the murder.  “I’m hungry. Let’s go by the diner on the way out there.”“Well, get ready for an ambush. Everybody in town’s pretty riled up. Chase Andrew’s murder’s the biggest thing’s happened ’round here, maybe ever. Gossip’s goin’ up like smoke signals.”“Well, keep an ear out. We might pick up a tidbit or two. Most ne’er-do-wells can’t keep their mouths shut.”  The “I’m hungry” line was just so random, I stared at it with amusement the first time I read it. None of the dialogue was particularly good, except the courtroom, and even some of the questions in there were a little strange. Tate’s and Kya’s teenage conversations made me wonder does Owen remember what it was like to be a teenager. It’s clear Owens doesn’t trust her readers enough to let us fill in the gaps ourselves. Every character must explain their motivation, and their personality and their flaws. People are rarely that self-aware, so we’re left with a book of nice writing, but absurd execution otherwise.The plot was also disappointing. It’s set up as a murder mystery, but there’s no mystery. As readers, we’re not given relevant clues that let us guess or theorise. Similar to the characters, everything needs to be told to us. Like I said, this is mostly about Kya and her life, but her life can be so unspectacular and mundane at times. And the ending I believe was severely unfair and terribly done. From an analytical perspective, it would've been good, but when you have such a mishmash of characterisation, it doesn’t make sense. The ending deserved better. It isn't surprising or astonishing, since there was no build-up to it. I actually think the ending  contradicts  the intended message so I was lost in what Owens was really trying to do.What I expected before reading: Two boys are entranced by a mysterious girl, who has lived alone in the wild for several years with little human contact. They slowly learn she isn’t as wild or crazy as she’s painted out to be, but rather someone kind and in touch with nature. What I got: A girl who’s pretty much normal falls in love with a wimp and an asshole (I feel bad for using these terms, but that's what they were), a book stuffed with underdeveloped characters and a weak plot, and writing that is beautiful to read, but doesn’t carry much weight.Sorry lads, I can’t understand the hype for this one at all."
118,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28438082-provin-martin,Rating 5 out of 5,"Deep in the wilderness of Barkley Cove lives a woman named Catherine Daniel Clark. Most people know her as the marsh girl but those closest to her know her as Kya. She’s the youngest daughter in a family who slowly abandons her one by one. Young Kya thrives in the Marsh with the help of a local store owner (Jumpin) and Tate. Tate is four years older than Kya, but he has always loved and protected her. He teaches Kya to read/write and years down the road encourages her to publish her books on the creatures and plant life of the Marsh. One day a body is found in the Marsh and the townspeople suspect Kya is the killer. Will she lose the life she has built for herself or will the town find her innocent?This was a wonderful read. It’s a book that has everything: a coming of age story, a romance or two, a murder mystery and a reunion of lost family. Great book to take to the pool or beach. My only regret is how long it sat on my book shelf before I was able to read it! 😉"
119,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41862451-nilguen,Rating 5 out of 5,"In her gripping debut novel, Delia Owens harmonizes romance, nature and mystery in a coming-of-age story. Growing up in total isolation in the marshland of North Carolina, Kya proves that humankind is capable of doing anything for survival. I have instantly locked Kya in my heart and immersed myself in the atmosphere and her emotional experiences.Owens lives and breathes the philosophy of strong ties to nature and has her reader participate in a well of knowledge that she conveys in an extremely engaging way. This novel gave me goosebumps with each secret lifted! Crystal-clear recommendation! Has anyone watched the movie yet? I am not sure, if the screen adaptation will do any justice to this masterpiece in writing!Thanks to NetGalley for an ARC in exchange for my honest review.Find me on instagram"
120,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1880531-caro-bookaria,Rating 5 out of 5,"A brilliantly written, beautiful, and enigmatic novel. This is the most captivating book I've read this year and I am so glad to have picked it up.The story follows Kya Clark , the ""marsh girl"", as she grows up on her own on the North Carolina coast.  When the town's beloved Chase Andrews shows up dead, Kya becomes one of the suspects.Although the mystery aspect of the novel is interesting, what really takes the novel to the next level is the author's prose and well-drawn character. I loved the time spent with Kya on the marsh as she observes nature and makes a life of her own. The description of the marshes' natural environment is so vivid that is almost a character itself.A wonderful novel that stands on its own, it would make a great selection for book club discussion. I loved it and highly recommend it!* I read this book with the Traveling Sisters. Our discussions made my experience more enriching and interesting*"
121,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91622714-rosh,Rating 3 out of 5,"In a Nutshell: This went better than I had expected, because I had zero expectations. 😉 I loved some parts, but found some other parts preposterous. So mixed feelings overall, being just a little bit tilted towards the positive side. Whether and how much you enjoy this book will strictly depend on what you focus upon while reading it.Story:The book has two distinct timelines that merge towards the end. 1969. The body of a popular local young man named Chase Andrews is discovered in the swamp. There seem to be no obvious clues about how he died, but the Sherriff and his assistant suspect murder. The only suspect is a young girl Kya Clark, who stay in the marsh, isolated from “civilised” society. This timeline focusses on the investigation.The other timeline begins from 1952 and works its way towards 1969 and beyond. This timeline shows the background of Kya, beginning from when she was six years old. Abandoned by every member of her family, Kya has just the marsh and its resident creatures for company for many years. Two young men enter her life for two separate purposes, but Kya soon learns that she might be better off not having expectations from anyone.Where does life take Kya? Is she innocent or guilty? This book has always generated highly polarised reviews, and I was almost on the verge of throwing it out of my TBR last month. But as luck would have it, its winning the BOTM poll in my Facebook group made it mandatory reading for me. I can now understand the varying reactions it provokes. Let me return to my earlier sentence: “Whether and how much you enjoy this book will strictly depend on what you focus upon while reading it.” If you are the kind of reader who loves lush descriptions of nature and a vivid portrayal of every scene, you will find loads to enjoy in the book. The picture of nature that she creates is brilliant, almost unparalleled. One can see how much of a nature lover the author is. (Her scientific background helps too.) Every aspect of the story that is connected to nature is mesmerising in its comprehensiveness and its intricacies. At the same time, there can be too much of a good thing. I enjoyed the descriptions for some time but then found myself jumping over them like a runner races across hurdles. Filtering out the plot from the natural details is an easy task for any avid reader. One good thing is that the excessive detailing doesn’t make the book as slow as I had assumed. If you were the kind of reader who picked this up because it is also touted as a “murder mystery”, sorry to disappoint you but there is hardly any mystery. Again, if you are an avid reader, the whole plot surrounding the murder is blatantly obvious. To add to the issue, there is a lot of hoohah over whether Kya committed the crime, and then there’s a final twist about who actually committed it. But does it reveal how exactly the crime was committed? Nope! What was the point of its being a murder mystery then? A mystery is not just a killer and a victim but also the modus operandi, which we readers never get to sink our teeth into.If you are the kind of reader who has, for lack of a better phrase, a “poetic soul”, you might enjoy this book. Even beyond the paeans being sung to the marsh, there are many poems scattered throughout the narrative. To the correct target reader, this will be a soul-satisfying experience. (I don’t think it will come as a big shock to my close friends if I say that I am not in this category. I skipped over every single poem except the very last one!)If you are the kind of reader who considers character development as integral to the narrative as the imagery and scene development, you might end up disappointed. Kya is the only main character, and her portrayal comes across as larger than life in many ways. My heart did go out for her, the way she was left behind by everyone she loved. Her pain seemed very real and as a little child left alone like that, she won me over. But soon her portrayal went way over the top. With just a local boy teaching her how to read when she entered her tween years, she becomes an expert pseudo-scientist and author. She pens impressive poems. She paints amazingly realistic sketches of the marsh and its denizens. It just seemed unbelievable. To be a prodigy in one area while being educated is difficult enough, and here we have a girl who went to school for just ONE day of her life, is educated in the alphabet and numbers by a teenager, and yet graduates to reading academic textbooks, recognises shells by their Latin names, and knows about grasses, shells, mushrooms, birds, tides & currents, and every other aspect of the marsh! Not to forget that she doesn’t own a single cookbook and has no one in her life to guide her about cooking (nor does she ask anyone), and yet we find her improving on her cooking skills as well. Kya is the only character who actually develops as the story progresses, but her development goes from level zero to level 100 with no in-between. You expect me to believe that a marsh girl who never ever went to school understood Einstein's concepts of gravitational energy simply through reading? Quite implausible.The rest of the characters are quite uni-dimensional. The secondary characters fall neatly into slots: good person (Jumpin, Mabel, the lawyer, the publisher,…) or good person making one mistake (Tate, Jodie, Kya’s mom) or bad person (Chase, many townspeople,…) There is no layer or depth to any of the characters. They are either loveable or “slappable”.The uniqueness of the book lies in these points:1.	That it has a young girl battling the world alone, á la Tarzan of the marsh. 2.	That it provides the voice to a character who is rarely given a dominant role in fiction: a person belonging to the so-called “white trash” section of society. It's like hearing from Mayella Ewell from “To Kill a Mockingbird” but in a more polished way.3.	That it has one of the most beautifully penned elements of the marsh and other aspects of natural beauty. This could have been a memorable read for me but the core content got buried under the showiness and the exaggeration outweighed the realism. I am more of a plot+character reader than a lyrical prose lover, so the book didn’t satisfy me on the points that matter most to me. Having low expectations helped tremendously. 3.25 stars from me.

123,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4876540-jonetta,Rating 5 out of 5,"Kya Clark has never known anyplace other than the marshes around Barclay Cove, North Carolina. Her impoverished family splintered because of her abusive alcoholic father and eventually she was left alone at the tender age of eleven when he walked away and never returned. Kya managed to support herself by selling mussels to a kind owner of a marina and learned to read with the help of a friend. But more importantly, she learned about life through the ecology and wildlife in the marshes. I don’t normally appreciate lots of descriptions about settings unless they are critical to the story and integrated expertly with the plots and characterizations. My instincts were to listen to this book instead of read it on my kindle app as I feared the marsh elements would overwhelm the story. I was right to listen to the book but for completely different reasons. The narrator, one of my favorites, brought the beautiful writing and imagery to life. Instead of being bored, I was enthralled. I could see the landscape that Kya saw, its beauty, sustenance and sanctuary amidst the poverty and bigotry of that era. The presentation was poetic in its delivery (I don’t normally like poetry!) and helped to create loveliness in Kya’s perspectives. Yes, this was expertly written. It’s not all imagery because Kya’s story is fraught with disappointments, danger and ugliness along with her appreciation of her life in the marshes. Known as the “Marsh Girl” by the people in town, you can imagine how she was treated whenever she ventured into their midsts. People fear and ostracize what they don’t understand and Kya is definitely misunderstood. A childhood friend becomes her lifeline who knows her heart and captures his. He becomes a symbol for all those who can see beyond their discomfort with the unknown. I loved this story that carried me through the course of Kya’s life and immersed me in her solitary world. The ending was one I foresaw but was still stunned by, leaving me reeling in the aftermath. I will always remember this character and story. I’ve a new appreciation for the satisfaction that can come from being alone when surrounded by natural beauty. (I received an advance copy from the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review)"
124,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38615628-cokey-cohen,Rating 1 out of 5,"The descriptions of nature in this book are beautiful and everything else is crap. Here’s a list:—Unbearable to read the exaggerated dialect (please, just tell me the characters have thick accents and let me do the rest of the work) and borderline racist to read the black characters’ even more exaggerated dialect. Some books can pull off dialect, but it has to scan naturally and make sense and this did not. It wasn’t even consistently written. Horrible!—Speaking of race, every black character in this book is loving and gentle and magical and utterly without personality; existing as props to make Kya feel better and survive. it’s bad, fam. Also, I recently read some other reviews/discussion of this book and so many readers are ""disappointed"" it that Kya was the murderer because it ""ruined her character."" They all hoped/believed the murderer would be... Jumpin. I guess because that wouldn't ruin his already not-pure character??? Gross.—The underage sex scenes were...not romantic. Even if you give the author some cred for realism—are 18 year olds hitting on 15 year olds irl? Sure, even though ew—you’re clearly supposed to see the Kya/Tate scenes and romantic, even as hot, and no. Stop.—the Amanda Hamilton poetry...—laughed out loud at the end.For more of my thoughts about this book and all the other books I'll read this month, check out my newsletter, A Month of Strong Opinions."

She is continually ridiculed by other children and most adults just for being different. She is referred to only as the ""Marsh Girl"" by all who see her. And, yet she is strong and determined enough to survive on her own and remains alone most of her life. This book is as courageous as it is heartbreaking. But could a child survive on her own into adulthood in the NC Marshland? The isolation would have been unbearable for most adults and would seem to be an almost unbelievable circumstance for a child to grow-up healthy in mind, body and soul. I tucked these ""impossible"" thoughts away as I let my mind wander with this story. I allowed my imagination to believe and let the author guide me on Kya's life journey. And then, I enjoyed every page. What a beautifully written story about nature vs nurture!I highly recommend this book!"

Unstoppable.God, I hate this book because it made me cry so much but equally loved it as it was such a beautiful, natural story with almost flawless storytelling.A full review soon, and the only reason it's short a star from a 5 is the dialogue -for me Kya was too smart when talking, considering her life- and the pace story was told suddenly changing in second half somehow disturbed me a bit.

It was trite, illogical and altogether infuriating. I kept waiting for all that gorgeous prose the reviews promised, and it never appeared. Believe me, I was so eager to find it.As someone who has lived her entire life in North Carolina, I have to raise my hand and say NO ONE SPEAKS LIKE THAT. The cadence and phrasing are entirely inauthentic. You know how, in Hollywood movies, every southern man sounds like John Wayne and every southern woman sounds like Scarlett O'Hara, regardless of whether they're from Virginia, Alabama or Texas and/or living in any century since the Revolutionary War? Yeah, that. But here we are presented with the one-size-must-fit-all southern white trash stereotype. Where the Crawdads Sing reads like someone binge-watched The Andy Griffith Show and then decided ""How quaint. I think I'll write a novel wrapped in what I imagine are Rural Southernisms.""If you are one of the few people left in the world who hasn't yet read this book, I give you this simple warning: Don't believe the hype."

I originally enjoyed it but had some reservations on that questionable ending. With the light of what came out about the author (her husband in particular but she’s still with him and she was there + the “plot twist”..) and the tweet that blew up last month, I no longer wish to support author in any way even if by a mere mostly positive review. The Owens aren’t the type of folk I’d wish to support nor encourage people to read their books. Going to Africa and shooting people to protect the elephants made sense to these folks apparently. Righteous motivation, anyone?Also, the article."

132,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5240149-brenda,Rating 5 out of 5,"Eleven months and five days into 2018, and I think I just found my favorite book of the year. I hope this review will do it justice. It’s impossible to pigeonhole this book; it’s multi-genre. Coming of age, love story, mystery, social commentary, historical.Kya, aka the Marsh Girl, is the main character, and I connected with her in several ways. The kid in me felt her loneliness, anger, cautiousness, and hope. The mother in me had me wanting to pick her up and bring her home, and when she discovered her scientific and artistic talents, I felt proud of her. As a woman, I was afraid for her; she had no worldly knowledge of men and society.I felt a visceral connection to the setting. The descriptions of the natural world were perfect. The marshes and swamps of coastal North Carolina are different from my personal natural world, but my love of the outdoors made me feel right at home there. Emotionally and spiritually, what Kya felt, I have felt in the woods and fields seeing the wonders of nature. I found the descriptions of the natural history of the flora and fauna to be accurate scientifically, and this would be expected from an author who is a wildlife scientist.Life in North Carolina in the 1950’s and ‘60’s is shown very well. Negatives include racial division, white trash, poverty, alcoholism, and wife beating, and positives include friendly neighbors, strong religious beliefs, and hard working men and women. The contrasts are evident, and how Kya fits in is sad and depressing.All the characters are well developed with human traits, and no one is pure devil or angel. The mystery of who killed Chase Andrews was well written with a surprising reveal. The trial was short and not filled with legalese.This is a wonderful debut novel. I loved it, and I strongly recommend this book! I am eager for more from Delia Owens."

 “I wadn’t aware that words could hold so much. I didn’t know a sentence could be so full.”


I cannot imagine a book that will end up beating Where the Crawdads Sing for my best read of 2018. Truly, this was a case where the entire thing was practically perfect in every way for me (the only minor quibble I had was with the snippets of poetry, but that’s because I hate poetry). Due to the fact that I am so absolutely strung out and hungover from this book, I’m going to do words even less well than I usually do. The story here starts in 1969 with a dead body – and then it immediately timehops back to 1952. It’s there you meet Kya on the day her mother has decided to up and leave the family and the marsh behind. Kya’s siblings follow their mother’s footsteps in short order – as does her father eventually. It’s then that Kya becomes known as “the Marsh Girl” and the reader works their way back to finding out what exactly happened to that dead fella. This was a true genre bender that had something for nearly everyone – coming of age, family strife, first love, first loss, and dare I forget – a potential murder. It was a modern day To Kill A Mockingbird and I feel so honored to have been approved for an advanced copy.If you’re looking for an epic tale that spans over five decades, look no further than . . . .

I think I had an intuition it would not be, which is why it took me so long to pick it up, but the rave reviews had me hoping I would be wrong. The story was very meager on plot, in my opinion, and the plot the pages did contain was not original. Nothing in the story came as a surprise. But I am not a plot driven reader, so if the characters had been engaging or imaginative, I could have absolutely loved this book. However, for me, they were not. I felt they were caricatures and the dialogue painful at times. The book could have been called, ""Where the Cliches Sing"". I don't like it when authors try to force readers to sympathize with their protagonists by making every awful thing that could happen to them happen. It's an unimaginative tool, in my opinion at least. If you're looking for an outstanding coming-of-age type of story with characters in difficult circumstances, I'd recommend The Power of One by Bryce Courtenay. I'm sorry to write a negative review because I know so much work and attention goes into writing and publishing a book, but I was disappointed, given how much positive attention this one received. I often feel let down by bestsellers, though. Perhaps my expectations are too high for them. In any case, if you decide to pick this one up, I hope you are among the majority who loved it. Sadly, this was not the case for me.Find more reviews and bookish fun at http://www.princessandpen.com"

I have to admit, WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING was not a five star read for me until it came full circle, but oh yeah.......love how it all played out!""A she-fox will sometimes leave her kits if she's starving or under some extreme stress."" WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING is little Kya's story, a tough, little intelligent six year old Kya who finds out about life in the hardest of ways....on her own....as she watches her mother walk away....her siblings leave, and is ultimately abandoned by her abusive coward of a father left to fend for herself in an old broken down shack in the swampland of a 1952 North Carolina.WTCS is an unbelievable coming-of-age and survival story with the added intrigue of murder, mystery, a very special friendship or two....AND a cat named Justice."

Finally with a book group scheduled, I picked it up to see what all the excitement was about. There are many aspects of this book that I enjoyed: 1) Kya's resilience 2) The sense of place 3) The courtroom drama 4) The kindness of friends (Jump and Mabel) 5) Sunday Justice. After discussing with the group I found that others also loved the brilliant marsh descriptions. Some appreciated the courtroom scenes. Others thought there was too much detail in that area. Other cat people unanimously agreed that Sunday Justice was a rock star. After the meeting I was even more certain of why this was not a 5-star book for me. It was the ending. I felt like I had been manipulated as a reader."

Well the answer is no I didn’t enjoy it, I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! No child should have their mother walk out on them, but that’s just what happened to Kya Clark when she was only six years old. Kya was convinced her mother would return, but as the days passed, Kya soon realized that maybe she would never see her mother again. One by one Kya’s siblings also leave home unable to put up with their fathers abuse and drunkenness until there is only herself and Pa left in the home. Kya is often left on her own as her Pa comes and goes as he pleases until one day he also doesn’t return. Kya is now only ten years old and left to fend for herself. Taking each day as it comes, Kya must now place the survival skills her Pa had taught her, like how to fish and how to drive the little boat he had into practice to get through each day. Kya never knew how to read or write, but she was one determined little girl who knew she could make it on her own. But living in the marsh on her own has its challenges, especially when Chase Andrews is found dead. Suspicions soon turn to Kya the Marsh Girl and she suddenly finds herself being interviewed by the police. Where the Crawdads sing is unlike any book I’ve read. The descriptions throughout this book are amazing to say the least. It’s a story that at first has you interested and intrigued and then when the mystery comes into it you keep turning the pages rather quickly wanting to know how it’s going to end. A very entertaining read which I know has been enjoyed by many, including myself and will continue to be loved by many more. Highly recommended."

It was masterful, exceptional, an outstanding tribute to the environment of North Carolina's coastline, of small town Southern living, of a people who lived, loved, and were products of their time.If you want to read a first rate novel just look to ....Where the Crawdads SingIn this novel, we meet so many characters that resonant with the songs of their upbringing, who fall to the lure of money, power, and the ways of what their insular world has decided. They harbor prejudice, animosity, and enmity for those who they consider below them.Delia Owens, our author in her inaugural novel, makes you one with the story. She assembles a group of characters ranging from the Marsh Girl, Kya Clark, a girl of mystery, forced to live on her own when her siblings, mother and eventually her cruel and callous father leave her, to the wonderful Tate who becomes her friend, her mentor, and the man she will some day love. Alas, though Tate also leaves her as she becomes a dupe for the unscrupulous Chase. There are the loving characters of Jumpin and Mabel, who look out for Kya with a quiet heart, with their loving manner propelling the story forward and portraying the beauty of caring for others. Conversely, Ms Owens, presents with a troop of hardhearted and callous folks who populate the town and feel that Kya is dirty, contaminated, and squalid. While reading this amazing story, I could not help but think of how some authors are just so good, the gift of story telling, seeming to be embedded into their very nature, a kind of extra gene in their DNA. Hard to imagine that this was the first book by this author, it as that outstanding. This author was in total control of all that is written, felt, and needed to make her book a spectacular achievement. Sure hoping there will be more.I think what struck me the most was her ability not only to make that environment so real, so much so that it became a character in and of itself. Her characters were part and parcel of what that environment was. They, to me, were the environment and the environment was them.There was really nothing that I would say was wrong with this book. It presented us with flawed characters and a story line that touched all of us. It was a story of loneliness, of love, of finding one's place in the world, even if that was a place where few dwelt.I was surprised by the ending, but did love it. In its conclusion, everyone got what they deserved, be it that touch of human love, of human kindness, and of human retribution. In my opinion, this novel was brilliant, a definite 5 star book for me.“I wadn't aware that words could hold so much. I didn't know a sentence could be so full.” Certainly we became aware of what words can hold thanks to Ms Owens outstanding book!Thank you to my local library for purchasing this book as well as a big thanks for the Traveling Sisters who read this amazing book with me.

144,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43642795-ines,Rating 3 out of 5,"I have read this book in a couple of evening, and I have to admit that it kept me well glued to its pages... I loved all of the first part of the book, especially the tragedy of Kaya and still living as little girl alone in the middle of the swamp.The way I am, I struggle and I can’t bear much when a plot turns too much to object honey love relationships and repetitive clichés up to boredom....The characters, some of them, are very interesting and well defined by Owens, even Kaya manages, despite its fragility and contradiction, to win your heart.The second part of the book I digested with much more difficulty if not with discomfort.... a kind of mistery seasoned to the harlequin style plot just did not expect it; it is all right, but this kind of ""melodrama"" tears was fine to a certain point...indeed, having set the plot in this way, the author has also slightly diminished the figure of Kaya and her strength in knowing how to face the difficulties of life. In short, this second part seems ready to be transformed into a text for American TV comedy.I don’t know what to say, it seems to me the classic fiction book written specifically to please readers, avoiding wisely by the author to put a little in clear something of her, of her heart... Ho letto questo libro in un paio di sere, e devo ammettere che mi ha tenuta ben incollata alle sue pagine....ho adorato tuttala prima parte del libro, soprattutto la tragedia di Kaya e del vivere ancora piccola bimba sola in mezzo alla palude.Per come sono fatta io, faccio fatica e non sopporto piu' di tanto quando una trama vira troppo mettendo ad oggetto relazioni amorose troppo mielose e clichè ripetitivi sino alla noia.....I personaggi, alcuni, sono molto interessanti e ben delineati dalla Owens, anche Kaya riesce, nonostante le sue fragilità e contraddizione, a conquistarti il cuore.La seconda parte del libro l' ho digerita con molta piu' difficoltà se non con fastidio....una sorta di mistery condito alla harlequin style proprio non me lo sarei aspettata; va bene tutto, ma questo melodrammone strappa lacrime mi è stato bene fino ad un certo punto...anzi, l'aver impostato così la trama,l'autrice ha anche un pò sminuito la figura di Kaya e la sua forza nel saper affrontare le difficoltà della vita. insomma, questa seconda parte sembra bello che pronto per essere trasformato in un testo per commedia Tv americana.Non saprei che dire, mi sembra il classico libro fiction scritto apposta per compiacere i lettori evitando oculatamente da parte dell'autrice di mettere un pochino in chiaro qualcosa di suo, del suo cuore..."

Kya's life is heartbreaking, especially at her young age before puberty, but I'm glad she's smart to survive the hard life. I like how she turned to nature to take care of her. I like that the author explain the meaning of the title in the story because I didn't understand the true meaning. It's good that readers get to know the people Kya encounter with thinks of her like Tate, Jumpin', etc. I like Tate and he's definitely cute when he informs a girl that she's becoming a woman. I cried as well as laughed reading this book. This book started out with a prologue differentiate between a marsh and a swamp. Then the author informed that two boys riding their bike spotted a jacket of a dead man left in the swamp that otherwise could have been undiscovered for its secluded location. Then the story begins, told in the third person point of view following Kya, 6, youngest of 5, living in a shack by the swamp/marsh. One day her mom left home and then one by one her older brothers and sisters because their dad is a brutal mean person to live with. She's forced to take care of herself since 6. The alternating view is the investigation. There is a timeline with Kya from the past and the investigation from the future. The mystery is a popular guy found dead in the swamp with no fingerprints and footprints. A girl rejected by everyone is accused because she's different. Where the Crawdads Sing is very well written and unputdownable. Everyone has been raving about this book and I finally put my other reads on hold to devour this story. I must say, the rave is real and this story is fantastic! It's my favorite for the year. As heartbreaking as I felt for Kya, she's definitely a role model for the curious minds. After reading this book, I will be binging on videos of the marsh and swamp on YouTube! I absolutely loved the lessons on love and men using animals as a guide! That courtroom trial was spectacular. Visit my blog for more at www.howusefulitis.wordpress.com xoxo,Jasmine"
149,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19559507-carolyn,Rating 5 out of 5,"Where the Crawdads Sing is a very special and unique book and definitely one of my favourites of 2018. When town sporting hero, Chase Andrews is found dead at the bottom of an old fire tower in the North Carolina marsh, rumours spread quickly that the ""Marsh Girl"" is responsible. Kya Clark is the ""Marsh Girl"", abandoned first by her mother, then her siblings and finally, when she was 10, by her abusive, drunken father who went to town and never returned, leaving her alone in an old shack in the marsh. Somehow Kya survived, collecting mussels to sell at the marina gas station to the old guy who ran the station, Jumpin', in exchange for gas and food. Jumpin' and his wife Mabel were the only ones who showed any care or concern for Kya, giving her old clothes as she grows as well as extra food. Scorned and ridiculed on the only day she went to school, Kya avoided the town but made friends with Tate, a boy who liked to fish in the marsh and shared her passion for the wildlife around them. Tate eventually teaches Kya to read and write but it is the marsh that becomes her classroom as she studies and learns all about the plant and animal species that live there.The murder mystery is almost in the background here as the marsh dominates the narrative and atmosphere of this story. The writing is so evocative that the peace and beauty of the marsh and it's lagoons and waterways shine through. The author is herself a wildlife biologist and this is very evident in her beautiful descriptions of the insects and birds. This is one of those books that I will keep thinking of and won't easily forget."
150,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,Rating 4 out of 5,"A high 4 starsWhere the Crawdads Sing was beautiful, sad and somewhat joyful. Set in the 1950s and 1960s in the marshlands of North Carolina, the story focuses on Kya, who at age 6 is essentially abandoned in a shack by her whole family. Somehow, with very little help, she manages to raise herself, surviving on her love for and deep understanding of the natural world. In parallel, the story focuses on a murder that takes place in 1969. Slowly, Kya’s life and the unsolved murder come together. There was a lot I loved about this book. The natural setting and the author’s love of nature are potent and palpable. The author does a fabulous job dealing with the consequences of abandonment and loneliness. The author also does a good job of conveying a sense of the times, and the effects of racism and economic inequality. It’s hard to read this one without crying, but in the end it felt like a story about resilience more than about desperation. My only criticism is that there were two or three events that were too improbable, overstretching my ability to suspend disbelief. Otherwise, this was a great read. I read it with my reading buddies Angela and Diane, and as always am grateful for these monthly reads. Thanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for giving me access to an advance copy."

Μη σας πω μέχρι και στον ύπνο μου. Τι σε κριτικές εδώ στο goodreads, τι σε βιβλιοφιλικές ομάδες στο φατσοβιβλίο, τι σε φωτογραφίες των απανταχού bookstgagrammers στο instagram. Κάτι μου έλεγε ότι πρέπει να το διαβάσω αλλα την ίδια ώρα το απέφευγα σαν ο διάολος το λιβάνι γιατί συνήθως όταν ένα βιβλίο συνοδεύεται από τόσα ευχολόγια όπως αυτό, έρχεται η κακιά πεθερά εν προκειμένω εγώ του βάζει 2 αστεράκια στην καλύτερη των περιπτώσεων, τα συνοδεύει και από μια κριτική κόλαφο και ηρεμεί η ψυχούλα της. Κάτσε τώρα να σου πω το μπακράου πως τελικά το διάβασα. Όταν ξέκινησε λοιπόν η φασούλα με τον κορωναιο το παίρνεις λίγο ψύχραιμα λες ωραία ευκαιρία για λίγη ξεκούραση, να διαβάσω και τα αδιάβαστα της βιβλιοθήκης. Όταν ξαφνικά λοιπόν περάσαμε στην άλλη φασούλα, καραντίνα, κλειστά μαγαζιά εκτός από τον τρόμο που με έπιασε για το επαγγελματικό μου μέλλον που πλέον φαντάζει δυσοίωνο, με έπιασε και ο τρόμος μου Χριστέ μου τι να κάνω να πανικοβληθω; Δεν έχω αρκετά βιβλία να διαβάσω. Τρέχω λοιπόν την τελευταία μέρα πριν κλείσουν τα μαγαζιά σε γνωστή αλυσίδα, βουτάω τις καραβίδες και άλλα 2, σκάω την πενηνταρού το ευχαριστιέμαι και νιώθω μεγαλοδύναμη και πελούσια εισοδηματίας εκείνη την ώρα, πάω σπίτι και κάθομαι και το κοιτάω για μέρες.

Μέχρι που μια στιγμή λέω μια ψυχή που ναι να βγει ας βγει. Πάμε στο δια ταύτα τώρα γιατί ακόμα να σας πω πως μου φάνηκε το βιβλίο. Λοιπόν μπορούμε ν ανοιξουμε σαμπάνιες γιατί θες η καραντίνα, η κλεισούρα για πρώτη φορά κοινό δες εγώ και κριτικοί δες εσάς συμφωνούν. Miracolo. Το αγάπησα πολύ αυτό το βιβλιαράκι. Το αγάπησα για την αγνότητα που είχε ο λόγος του, την απλότητα και την ευγενική γραφή για ένα θέμα τόσο σημαντικό όπως της μοναξιάς και της εγκατάλειψης.Μια βαθύτατα τρυφερή και συγκινητική ιστορία που θα σου φέρει δάκρυα στα μάτια. Οι περιγραφές της φύσης μοναδικές με την πρωταγωνίστρια σαν άλλος Μόγλης ενηλικιώνεται παρέα με τη φύση, τα πουλιά, τους γλάρους. Ηταν ο βάλτος εκείνος που δεν την εγκατάλειψε ποτέ όταν οι άνθρωποι της γύριζαν την πλάτη. Η καρδιά μου πόνεσε και συγκινήθηκε με αυτό το βιβλίο. Αν θέλουμε πάντως να είμαστε εντελώς αντικειμενικοί σαν θεματική, σαν ιστορία δεν ήταν κάτι πρωτότυπο και εδώ είστε και εδώ είμαι πως αν την ίδια ακριβώς ιστορία που θυμίζει και λίγο μελό ελληνικού κινηματογράφου το υπέγραφε μια Λένα Μαντά, μια Δημουλίδου εμείς οι ίδιοι που τώρα γράφουμε ευχολόγια θα το είχαμε κράξει και θα το είχαμε χαρακτηρίσει οχετό της ελληνικής λογοτεχνίας. Θέλω να πω ότι είναι ένα βιβλίο που ενδεχομένως να μην αγγίξει αρκετό κόσμο και μπορώ να καταλάβω απόλυτα το γιατί. Θεωρώ ότι είναι να βιβλίο που κακά τα ψέμματα η φήμη που ανέπτυξε είναι κατά πάσα πιθανότητα πολύ μεγαλύτερη της λογοτεχνικής του αξίας, που όμως αν το διαβάσεις στη ��ωστή στιγμή να είσαι σίγουρος πως θα σου ζεστάνει την ψυχή.PS Κάνω μια μικρή διευκρίνιση χωρίς να διορθώσω αυτό που έγραψα αλλά περισσότερο γιατί δε θέλω να παραφραστούν τα λεγόμενα μου σε κάτι που δεν ήθελα να πω. Στην κριτική μου έκανα μια αναφορά, μάλλον καλύτερα μια σύγκριση με ελληνική λογοτεχνία. Θέλω να ξεκαθαρίσω ότι το εκεί που τραγουδούν οι καραβίδες ξεχώρισε στα μάτια μου για την λογοτεχνική αρτιότητα του λόγου του και φυσικά για την πραγματικά μοναδική ικανότητα της συγγραφέως προσαρμόζοντας τις γνώσεις της τις επαγγελματικές να μας τις περάσει με εύπεπτο και λυρικό τρόπο προσφέροντας μας απλόχερα τις γνώσεις της για την φύση και πως ένας άνθρωπος μεγαλώνει μέσα σε αυτήν την ίδια ώρα που εμείς την αρνιόμαστε και την καταπατούμε. Χωρίς όμως ν αναιρώ όλα τα παραπάνω αυτό που πραγματικά ήθελα να πω είναι ότι αν το δεις σφαιρικά και ενώ μιλάμε για ένα άρτιο αποτέλεσμα από τα λίγα που προσωπικά μίλησαν στην ψυχή μου τελευταία, σε καμία περίπτωση δε μπορείς να πεις για ένα κείμενο με μεγαλείο τέτοιο που θα το κατατάξει στα καλύτερα βιβλία όλων των εποχών οπότε και αναρωτήθηκα τι θα συνέβαινε αν αυτό το κείμενο έφερε την υπογραφή κάποιου άλλου και όχι ενός καταξιωμένου προσώπου στο χώρου του που έκανε τις γνώσεις του βιβλίο. Αυτό. Χωρίς καμία εμπάθεια για καμία πλευρά."

Where the Crawdads sing tells the story of a girl who grew up alone in the marsh, whose mother is Nature and whose father is a violent drunk her whole family run away from. I fell in love with this character since she appears as a 7-year-old girl, and I cared very much about her throughout the book. Well, actually, I cared about all the characters, even the not-so-positive ones: North Carolina people are described in such a caring way that, while reading, I fell in love not only with the place, but also with its people. When an author manages to create suspense and page-turning feelings in such a slow book, it is definitely a sign of talent: however, this book was lacking of something I can't properly put my finger on. Only thing I know is that, about two thirds into the book, right when the action was at its peak, I somehow lost some degree of interest; not in Kya, but in the story itself. May be that it lacked some originality, or that some sections dealing with legal matters where a little too slow; it might be that the focus was't so much on the nature and the marsh but on more ""human"" topics, might be the lack of focus on one of my favourite characters, Tate; or maybe it's just that I'm always more interested in coming-of-age stories and I just loved seeing Kya growing up.Anyway, whatever the reason, I recovered my full interest only during the last 10% of the book, and that is where the author struck me with an ending that was so rushed and, in some measure, predictable, that my interest fell again. So, overall, a skillfully written book, stunning setting and well-developed characters; but which lacks, in my opinion, on some aspects of the plot. I am still thankful to the author for guiding my imagination so well into Kya's world and North carolina's marsh."

Kya sat for days on the front porch, waiting for her ma to return. It was her brother Jodie who took to playing with her, taking her mind off her ma. But their Pa was relentless in his drunken rages, and one by one her siblings left, until it was just Jodie and Kya. When Jodie left, declaring he could stand it no longer, Kya was bewildered. Why did everyone she loved leave her?At times Pa was gentle, even kind – the day he called her “hun” was a day to remember. He taught her to fish, to drive his little boat – but then a letter arrived, and he returned to drinking and violence. When he finally left and didn’t return, Kya was ten years old - and truly on her own. But she was a strong, determined and intelligent little girl, and slowly she built a life for herself, surviving in the marshes that surrounded the shack.Everything in the marsh was life blood for her, and she learned quickly. Although she couldn’t read, or count past twenty nine, she knew far more than many people who lived in the area. Jumpin’, the owner of the little shop at the marina, bought the mussels she brought in, and in turn supplied her with the necessary items ��� and so she survived.Tate had been a friend from childhood; Chase was a young man she saw from afar. These two would become an intricate part of her life. But it was when Chase died that Kya’s life came crashing down around her…Spectacular! Stunning! Breathtaking! Heartbreaking! Where the Crawdads Sing has shot to the top of my favourites list for 2018 without a doubt! Unbelievable that this novel is the debut for author Delia Owens – I’ll definitely read her next! Everything about Where the Crawdads Sing was so well done; Kya’s character was beautifully written, the depiction of the area, the scenery, the marsh, the birds and animals – such a joy to read! I would like to thank everyone who recommended this novel to me, and I also recommend it, highly!"

They take their time and wander on this, their only chance to soar.”I wouldn’t say I am an outdoorsy gal, but this book made me want to run off and live in a marsh and be at one with nature. That alone is an extraordinary achievement!Set in North Carolina, Where the Crawdads Sing follows the life of Kya, a young girl who grows up isolated in a marsh. When handsome town resident Chase Andrews shows up dead, rumours circulate that it was Kya who was behind the murder.During my research, I discovered that Delia Owens has a PhD in Animal Behaviour and has co-written a number of nature books. So imagine my surprise that Owens writes fiction so beautifully. Often academic writers can be a little dry (such as myself), but Owens’ prose was breathtaking.I simply adored that Owens incorporated her own knowledge about nature and animals into the story, but in a way that suited the narrative instead of a case of info-dumping for the sake of it. It worked so perfectly in tune with Kya’s life and her backdrop.It took until around the 100 page mark before I became very emotionally invested, and then it was like a lightbulb switching on. I was ALL. IN. The relationship between Kya and Tate was so sweet. Some of their scenes together are etched into my brain forever.The story alternates between two timelines: Kya growing up and current day. Both are equally mesmerising as you try and work out where the narrative is going. Which is, of course, executed perfectly. As is everything else in this novel.A beautiful story looking at themes of isolation, resilience, love and acceptance. One of my very favourites of the year so far! 5 stars."
156,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2795921-justin,Rating 4 out of 5,"I’ve had Where the Crawdads Sing on hold for a long time. It’s been on hold at two libraries, in regular and large print. I’ve had it on hold on two different library apps, as both an ebook and audiobook. And lo and behold it finally arrived as an audiobook last weekend! So now I’m caught up to the rest of the reading world on this one. Also, I think I feel generally the same way as most of the reading world about this book. Admittedly, it took several chapters for me to really get into the story. I think I expected it to be something different. It wasn’t that riveting early on, honestly. Lots of To Kill a Mockingbird vibes going. Pa out there shuckin’ the corn while me and Ma washed the beans. We drove down to the ole general store and bought some taters and turnips. That kind of stuff. There were a lot of pages dedicated to painting the scene and describing the setting, but it the end it was worth it. As the story rolls along it became more and more captivating. It’s written extremely well, almost too perfectly. It’s settled right there 60 years ago or so, and it feels pretty timeless, like it’s gonna be around for a while. Like people are gonna be reading this thing for decades to come. Thanks, Reese Witherspoon! So, yes, like I was saying... I found myself more engaged in the story as it pushed forward, and I was ultimately really satisfied with how everything wrapped up. It came to a nice and neat conclusion, and the last third of the book was really powerful, hard to put it down, or hard to hit the pause button, I guess. There are a plethora of genres represented here, too, guaranteed to please just about everyone. Murder mystery, coming-of-age, romance, historical fiction, marshes and the people that inhabit them (which is a huge fiction sub-genre), and many more. This book is all packaged together, waiting to be delivered to you in some form and fashion, and demanding of a minimum of a three star rating. You may rate it higher than that, and you probably will, and that’s fine, but you will not rate it lower than that. It will not be possible for you. You may want to sometimes, but you will relent quickly. You will start to question why would you ever do that to such a beautiful book. What kind of person are you, you may ask yourself. The kind of person who loves Where The Freaking Crawdads Sing. That’s who you are. Be true to yourself. "

I love that she thrived despite everything life threw at her.The beginning was a bit slow and tedious, and I was ready to put it down. Still, I decided to press on because I was a bit intrigued, and next thing you know, I was utterly hooked and sitting on the edge of my seat, waiting on a verdict like the OJ Simpson trial.I became enthralled in Kya's life and was thankful that she had a few spots of sunshine and kindness in the wilderness of her survival. Expect a slow start, and then if you can get emotionally invested in Kya, you will get hooked on this one—excellent Historical Fiction. 5 Stars"

The first half of the book with the luscious descriptions of the Carolina coastline and swamps is nice, but the second half becomes a Scott Turow courtroom drama with an all-too-predictable ending. I really wanted to enjoy this one more, but I had a really hard time appreciating why it was praised so highly. If you want to read about white trash, I would recommend the far more impressive and better-written and with a far more charismatic protagonist book Disgrace by JM Coetzee (winner of the Nobel Prize in 2003)."

I don't think it's my reading slump that prevented me from going ga-ga over this novel. I didn't hate it but wasn't wowed by it.It's not a bad debut novel, but I found it uneven, the childhood period taking way too many pages. The main plot point - involving the abandonment of a seven-year-old in a shack in the North Carolina marshes and her surviving by herself - was a bit far-fetched. The jumping of timelines was jarring and unnecessary. The pacing had problems, the first half was very slow and a bit redundant, while in the second half, the author threw lots of things into the mix. The main problem for me was that the characters didn't feel authentic or fully formed. I did enjoy the descriptions of the environment. Generally speaking, Where the Crawdads Sing was too melodramatic for my liking."

Her story is sad yet shows how her strength and courage help her to forge a life on her own.

I found myself heavily invested In Kya’s story and hoping for a happy ending. The book was beautiful balanced. Romance, murder, nature, coming of age were all aspects of this novel but no one aspect was too overpowering to the story as a whole. It all fit so well together.I’m recommending this book to the other readers in my life"
165,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"Oh, so the author thinks we're all idiots. Got it. Also, settle in. I've a lot of venting to do.I'm not going to summarize this book, because, if you're reading this, I have a feeling you came to GoodReads to do what I did: find reviewers who hated this book as much as you did.I liked the very first part (which is why it has one star) and found the story rather intriguing. I was really hoping that the intrigue and mystery (Kya herself is a bit of a mystery and I liked that) would keep going. But holy tropes, Batman! Could we have had more of a clichéd lineup of characters? The jock, the golden boy, the magical negro and his pillowy wife. The slightly bumbling sherrif and yee-haw of a deputy. The horribly prejudiced townspeople who somehow miraculously drop their prejudices when the whip-smart yet kind attorney-who-came-out-of-retirement (why did he do so, anyway? There's no real reason mentioned) gives them The Big Speech. And of COURSE, the magical, brilliant, tough, beautiful, resilient, self-educated main character who not only learns how to read TEXTBOOKS IN ONE SUMMER, but who is so, so, SO smart, that she reads and understands Albert Einstein. All after one whole day of school plus three months with Tate. Sure.AND HERE THERE BE SPOILERS:Also, and this irritated me to no end: any law enforcement officer worth his salt would have collected her alibi to potentially rule Kya out as a suspect BEFORE THE TRIAL. He'd have driven to the motel and gotten the clerk's alibi, gone to the Trailways station(s) and checked with the ticket people, and the folks at the restaurant, etc. She'd have been cleared immediately, because she'd have been placed firmly in another town at the time of the murder, eyewitnesses or no. There wouldn't have been a trial. Also, what's Kya's motive? That Chase almost raped her? Are you fucking kidding me with this? So, let me get this straight: she lets her anger simmer for months. Then she manages to drum up a plan that involves her being out of town, taking multiple buses (when she's never taken one before), know where Chase is, sneak out, go back to the swamp, find him at the right time and place, push him off the tower, and get back to the motel without anyone (aside from two dudes in a shrimp boat who can't positively identify her) seeing her? And having the foresight to wipe down all the fingerprints? Sure, I'll give you ""the tide washed away the foot prints,"" but really? Not one fingerprint? GTFOH.AND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON EVERYTHING ELSE: The fact that the author seems to have done no research on North Carolina's actual geography (Asheville? Really?), Kya, the magical wonder's self-published books, the honorary doctorate, the whole, last-minute, ""whoops! Turns out she did it after all and also SHE'S Amanda Hamilton! Gawrsh!"" bullshit. Also, how TF did she learn to cook well before she had a cookbook? She goes from not knowing how to cook grits as a six-year old to a seven year-old who makes an entire meal for her father. Puh-lease.The ""Amanda Hamilton"" poetry was utter dreck. And, although this has nothing to do with the poetry and should probably be in another paragraph (but I've clearly been inspired by the poor writing in the book), holy HELL, did I hate the utter, pretty racist non-dimensionality of Jumpin' and Mabel. They only exist as caricatures, and would honestly not be out of place in ""Song of the South."" I hate this book, and I want my 13 hours back.ALSO, NO SOUTHERNER WOULD EVER CALL ""GRITS"" POLENTA!"" *throws book across room*"

Kya Clark's story is an extraordinary tale of courage, loneliness, isolation, love, and warmness. Loved by two different guys Andrew Chase & Tate, Kya has lost faith in other people who always leave her eventually.Book Structure:The book is around 370 pages divided into 57 chapters. It is a third-person's narration. The story follows the main protagonist Kya from childhood to her adulthood.""Over the years the mysteries of her story became legend, told over and over with buttermilk pancakes and hot pork sausages at the dinner.""This is one of those books that are hard to review because I feel I cannot make enough justice to it. The writing is so lyrical & beautiful, be it the beautiful descriptions of the settings and nature or the detailed layers the characters had. They all merge into one marvelous piece of art literary fiction. The story is very emotional and readers will root for the main character and sympathize with her for what she had to go through. It can be slow at times, but I feel the slowness of events at times helped me as a reader to feel the loneliness of the character.Besides the main character, there are many side characters that one will love. The author did a great job in giving all these characters different shades of insecurities which is something very human. The other highlight of this book is the multiple important subjects it tackles subtly like human's connection with nature, family, and the outer world. The Marsh Girl has won my heart! Delia Owens has one new fan. I have to get and read her other books. If you have not read Where the Crawdads Sing yet you should do that very soon. You won't regret it. This book was nominated as one of the best historical fiction in the Goodreads Choice Awards 2018. It was the fifth most voted book for that award. It's 5 stars for me."

I prefer to have an unobstructed view to the speaker and don’t feel shy about sitting alone in the center of the first row, but clearly, if others like to have an unobstructed view, their preference for being more obscure or part of a crowd, protected in a pack in the middle or back, surrounded by others and not so close, outweighs the desire to be directly in front. The author, Delia Owens was at the podium getting herself prepared for her book talk on Where the Crawdads Sing, her first fiction book, and she looked directly at me sitting alone and smiled. She came over to say hello, thanked me for attending and told me she knew me from Instagram.The room started to fill up and Delia sat down next to me in the front row and I had the wonderful opportunity to talk with her for a while before the program began. She told me she lived in Africa with her husband, now ex-husband for 23 years. They were married for over 40 and several years ago divorced. They still live together on the same property in Idaho but it is a huge piece of land so it is working out fine for now. We talked about the pressure her relationship endured in those years, being so secluded from other humans while they did research, and how the hopes of it repairing itself upon their return went unfulfilled.This one on one conversation along with Delia Owens’ public talk on Where the Crawdads Sing, her research on the social biology of animals, and her book’s main character Kya, who grew up on her own in the marsh in North Carolina got me thinking about seclusion, women, being alone and how everyone has different levels of enjoyment and tolerance when they are solo. According to Delia, just as in a troop of baboons, a herd of elephants, and a pride of lions, human females tend to travel in groups, play, eat and sleep together. There are many benefits of having alone time, but how much is too much? Isolation can change a person, and in Kya, a character based on many women the author knows, we can see how being alone can have major impact. But as Delia said, women are strong. We can do a lot more than we think we can and when put in the situation, we do it.She said she wrote Where the Crawdads Sing in two parts, PART 1 is The Marsh – a beautiful place of light and sparkling water. Part 2 is The Swamp – a dark place. Like Kya, her character in the book, sometimes in our lives we go to The Swamp, but we always strive for the Marsh.Delia Owens is an inspiring speaker, well prepared as one would expect a researcher would be. She did say, standing up in front of a room full of women caused her to experience the same feelings she has when being rushed by lions in Africa – a sign to me that she does not crave crowds and probably feels most peaceful alone and riding horses. She did mention her house is many miles from civilization and she goes to town one a week to see people when she is at home in Idaho. It was incredible to meet her in person and observe how her life experiences influenced her and how so much of that is evident in her writing. Where the Crawdads Sing was chosen for Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine Book Club and I agree with Reese when she says she didn’t want the book to end!My Review: A love story, a mystery and a courtroom drama… Where the Crawdads Sing has all that it takes for a compelling and beautifully rich novel. Just as author Delia Owens’ went way out yonder where the crawdads sing to connect with nature, the main character, Kya becomes one with her surroundings. As each important person in her life abandoned her, Kya learned to be self sufficient and survive alone in the marsh as a very young child. With limited human contact and lack of strong friendships, her natural surroundings became her mother. She is awkward around other people yet capable and self reliant. She learned all she needed to know to sustain a comfortable life, until her desire for personal connection, touch and love emerged as she grew up. She muddled her way through the hurt of abandonment as she embarked on a new adventure of companionship – but life is complicated. Now she is a grown woman, and there is a murder in the marsh. Her isolation over the years influenced her odd behaviors and has made her a target for ridicule and an obvious earmark for blame. Most of the townspeople are agains her – will anyone come to her rescue as she is accused of the unthinkable or will she have to fend for herself as she has done her entire life?The natural beauty of the marsh, the heartbreak and loneliness of Kya, the suspense and unfolding of the mysterious murder and the love story that beats all odds combined into an emotional, descriptive and addictive, well written novel made it impossible for me to put down. I highly recommend Where the Crawdads Sing! Please follow Book Nation by Jen."

That is where Catherine Danielle (Kya) Clark lived all of her life. Her father brought the family to the marshland 4 miles from Barkley Cove, North Carolina after he was wounded in WWII. He was bitter, depressed, reclusive and mean. Finally, Kya's mother couldn't take it any more and in 1952 when Kya was 6 her mother left and never returned. One by one Kya's 4 older siblings also fled their abusive father, and none thought to take Kya along with them. So Kya learned to survive on her own in the marsh, keeping away from her drunken father for the most part, until suddenly he was gone too. Amazingly, no family or church tried to help this child. She was the Marsh Girl, too different to associate with the polite society of Barkley Cove. She grows up in isolation and is profoundly scarred by her abandonment and solitude. The only people who helped to keep her fed and clothed, and advised her, were a black family who were also not accepted by Barkley Cove. There was one boy who befriended her, Tate Walker who charmingly approached her with gifts of feathers. Later there was another boy, Chase Andrews, and when he was found dead in 1969 Kya was suspected of his murder. Kya was mesmerized by the natural world that was her home and this book beautifully describes that world. She was very intelligent and self taught and she knew the marsh as a scientist would. However, her knowledge was much deeper because she became as much a part of the marsh as the fireflies, seagulls, shells and grasses that she studied. The author is a scientist, and it shows, but she is also an excellent novelist. Near the end of the book it becomes a really compelling courtroom drama. I was invested in its outcome and had no idea how it would (or should) turn out. Kya has depths that not only the residents of Barkley Cove but the readers cannot guess. I'd be happy to read more by this author. I received a free copy of this book from the publisher. "

I picked this book up this morning and didn't put it down until I was done. That's when you know you've read something special.Where the Crawdads Sing is the story of Kya, a young girl who lives with her odd family in the marsh outside of town. When Kya is six, her mother leaves. And slowly after that so does the rest of her family until she's alone and trying to survive in a marsh. Fast forward many years later and Kya is accused of murdering the town golden boy, and we as the readers follow along with the story of how Kya got there and the mystery of what happened.  “Autumn leaves don't fall, they fly. They take their time and wander on this their only chance to soar.”  First off, this has been bugging me. How can so many people abandon a child? My heart continuously broke for Kya because so many people left her and never looked back. A whole town ignored her! (With the exception of like, 3 people). Such a beautifully written story, lush words and unforgettable characters. Delia Owens made a bang with her fiction debut and I for one cannot wait until she releases another book. I would say more, but honestly I just finished the book and am floored. It was marvelous, what more is there to say?  “I wadn't aware that words could hold so much.

The book that you will remember in 10 or 20 years and people will still be talking about then! Hard to believe it's written by a wildlife scientist who has only co-written non fiction before this her debut novel. First let me give Delia Owens a standing ovation. Not only did you write a amazing Empathetic character, vivid setting you can live in, incredibly engaging story, but the pace never slowed down. That's all you need for a 5 star all time great story. I'll try to tick the positives off 1 by 1 for this review.1) characters: Catherine Danielle Clark (Kya) is abandoned by her family at a young age and left alone in a shack on the outer bank of a North Carolina swamp. Dubbed the ""marsh girl"" she is ostracized by the townsfolk. You see her grow up dogging officials trying to make her go to school, selling mussels to survive, learning everything about the marsh, falling in love, and become a expert published biologist. But Kya is not the only great character Chase Andrews, Tate, Jumpin' and Mabel. the truth is Owens fills a small southern town with believable characters.2) story structure: where the crawdads sing implements my favorite way to tell a tale. hits you with a stunning first chapter. Then a plot using flashbacks to tell the main story as the plot develops. top it of with a court case summing up everything and a hammer blow of a last chapter and you have the perfect story structure where the excitement builds and the pace never falters. 3) world setting: This is the real unique thing about Where the crawdads sing and Owens' background as a biologist. she writes this in biological terms. Kya herself thinks in these term but Owens' brings the swamp alive i grew to love it as Kya did. that's not even taking into account the small Town of Barkley Cove. I live halfway between Ashville which is in the story and Atlanta so this is my neck of the woods and i think Delia Owens has taken a snapshot of a 1960 southern town in all its not so great glory! Add the wilderness of the marsh and this is worldbuilding on par with fantasy or sci-fi genre.4) Ending: There is a satisfying wrap-up to all events after the trial. with a shocking reveal at the end forcing you to revisit your feelings. great ending no spoiler! That's the big three Characters, structure, and world. but even with those elements in place a book can still fail with the ending but Owens takes it home. I might be parcial to this because it reminds me so much of my favorite book to kill a Mockingbird. But i see most people like it as well and they're working on a movie! so in the words of my Goodreads friend Baba ""just read it already""! "

This debut novel does a nice job of combining the heartbreaking story of an abandoned (at age 7!) young girl growing up in the marsh area off the coast of North Carolina in the 50's and 60's, a whodunnit murder mystery and a little bit of romance. I felt like I really was there in the marshes with Kya Clark, feeling a part of nature but wanting human connections as well. The early abuse and neglect of Kya is pretty harrowing stuff. Possibly it goes down easier when the writing is lyrical and poetic (Exhibit 1: see Angela's Ashes) but it was still hard to read that part.Where the Crawdads Sing sucked me right in and was almost impossible to put down. But I really wanted to know what became of her father! Maybe not the most mind-boggling mystery or compelling love story I've ever read, but all in all it was a fine book. "

The book is not even remotely good, and you can have my copy if you come dig it out of the recycling bin.It’s been a long time since I’ve just completely given up on a book. 133 pages into this shitty novel, and I’m over it. For those who haven’t hear the mega hype about it... There’s a murder in a small town in 1969. Jump back to nearly 20 years earlier—a girl, Kya, is abandoned in her home in a North Carolina marsh in the 1950s. She basically raises herself.Hmm, geez, do you think she had something to do with the murder? 🤦‍♀️While Kya’s raising herself, we’re supposed to believe that she only went to school one day in her life but learned to read in a few hours with the help of another teenager. Within a few months she was apparently reading medical journals (the author specifically says that Kya was reading about stem cells in 1960). Not that this is impossible, but also—what the fuck does this have to do with the murder? What does any of her feather collecting have to do with “coming of age”? (Spoiler alert: It’s just some self-serving filler by an author whose background is apparently in animal conservation and zoology.)Oh, wait, back up—did I say Kya was raising herself? I meant that she was getting a whole lot of help from a black man named only “Jumpin’ “ and his wife Mabel. Jumpin’ buys mussels and smoked fish off of her and keeps her movements secret from social services while Mabel takes up church collections to provide Kya with clothing and food.At one point, Jumpin’ is harassed with a certain slur (insert John Mulaney’s “that’s the worse word” here; the author did not need to include this little bit about how 14 year old Kya knew that it was “a bad word” because her “Pa” used to say it, we FUCKING KNOW). Kya hits one of the antagonists in the back of the head. That’s as much as I’ve heard about “Colored Town” in 133 pages. Apparently, in the North Carolina marsh, black people are magical saviors of little white girls. But they don’t have their own stories.So as I’m reading and groaning through 100+ pages, I got to the bit about stem cells and stopped. Rolled my eyes so hard I fell out of bed. Looked up Delia Owens.Here’s a wild fucking ride of an article from The New Yorker in 2010, documenting Delia and ex-husband Mark Owens exploits in Africa in the 1980s.

186,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15493045-lisa,Rating 5 out of 5,"A beautifully written portrait of a young girl living in the North Carolina marsh who faces more adversity than most of us could imagine. SUMMARYA young girl, Kya Clark watched from the porch as her mother walked down the sandy path in her alligator pumps, carrying her blue train case. Kya knew her mom wouldn’t be back when she didn’t wave to Kya from the end of the lane. Soon Kya was all alone, but she found consolation in the North Carolina marsh. She fed the gulls and they became her friends, she dug mussels and they became her food and she painted pictures of the marsh, and that became her love. She was judged, ridiculed and scorned by the most of the townspeople, so she stayed away. But in late in 1969, when the handsome quarterback, Chase Andrews is found dead in a nearby cove, the locals immediately suspect Kya, who they have always called the “Marsh Girl.” But Kia is not anything like they think. She is sensitive, talented and intelligent and has survive for years alone in the marsh. “Sometimes she heard night-sounds she didn’t know or jumped from the lightning too close, but whenever she stumbled, it was the land who caught her. Until at last, at some unclaimed moment, the heart-pain seeped away like water into sand. Still there, but deep. Kia laid her hand upon the breathing, wet earth, and the marsh became her mother.”REVIEWKya is like a beautiful deer grazing on the marsh grass only to bolt into the palmetto brush at the first sound of danger. WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING is a first rate journey into the marsh on the North Carolina coast with vivid and magnificent descriptions. But it’s so much more. It’s an expertly delivered portrait of a young girl who faces loss, adversity, desperation and loneliness. But overcomes her hardships with perseverance, resilience, hopefulness and love. The writing is lyrical and profound and this coming of age story of survival is stellar. You can’t help but fall in love with Kya, and the few people who have chosen to help her: Tate, Jumpin, and Mabel. My favorite part of the book was when Tate was teaching Kya to read, and she sounds out her first full sentence: “There are some who can live without wild things and some who cannot.” Tate responds “You can read Kya, there will never be a time again when you cannot read.” Kyra says “It ain’t just that. I wan’nt aware that words could hold so much. I didn’t know a sentence could be so full.” A beautiful sentence, and the entire book is like that. Some sentences will just take your breath away. Author DELIA OWENS grabs her readers and takes us on a marvelous journey into the marsh, and enlightens us all with its beauty. Owens is the co-author of three internationally best-selling nonfiction books about her life as a wildlife scientist in Africa. Where the Crawdads Sing is her first novel. “She knew the years of isolation had altered her behavior until she was different from others, but it wasn’t her fault she’d been alone.

His father was abusive and this is why her mother and siblings left the Marsh.Kya gets nicknamed the Marsh Girl and she learns to survive on her own thanks to nature and her own desire to make it.In 1969, Kya is a young woman when the body of Chase Andrews is found and the townspeople point a finger at Kya as the main suspect. After all, rumor has it that Chase visited her all the time.Where the Crawdads Sing brought out so many emotions from sadness to anger to disappointment to happiness.Delia Owens makes the Marsh a character on its own.

A young kid left behind by everyone and no one really cared to help her except for Tate and Jumpin'. She was misunderstood and cast away, worse than an animal. Then there was the mystery of who killed Chase and why. If I'm being honest, I figured it out early on. However, I still like the way the story developed.Time to watch the movie.

'🆆🅷🅴🆁🅴 🆃🅷🅴 🅲🆁🅰🆆🅳🅰🅳🆂 🆂🅸🅽🅶' Is a full length stand-alone novel by new to me author Delia Owens. I saw one of my favourite authors on Facebook posting about this book and various others commenting on it, I decided then and there to 1click it and fell in love with this unusual unique story. My heart bled for the wee young girl Kya who was just seven years old, forgotten, left behind to fend for herself in a stark unforgiving wilderness in Carolina in the 1950's, the marsh becoming her home, earning her the name Marsh Girl many years later, the seagulls becoming her only family which didn’t leave her. Shunned by society because she was different, from the colour of her skin, to the way she dressed, she was too scared to let anyone in because if her own family walked away what's stopping others from doing the same? One by one her family walked away leaving her with a drunken abusive father, until he also disappeared from her life. Until one boy came into her life when she least expected it and taught her how to read and write and from that day on wards a whole new world opened up to her. This was a heartbreaking beautifully written story which will stay with me for a very long time. Everything we take for granted, from reading, to writing, to the clothes we have on our backs, so many lessons can be learnt within the pages of this book. This book humbled me. This isn’t something I would normally gravitate towards but when your usual genre isn’t grabbing you like it used to you have to break out and try something new and I’m so glad I gave this one a chance.

191,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11856352-mo,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book was heartbreakingly beautiful. Sometimes you read a book and it stays with you for quite a while. This seems to be one of those books, for me. I finished reading it and was still thinking about it hours later ... last night, I found it difficult to sleep and one of the reasons was that the book and the characters were still running around in my mind!Set in the marshes of North Carolina, Kya lives a lonely life, seemingly abandoned by all her family. The birds and marshlands are her family now ... The descriptive narrative of the marshes of North Carolina might make some eyes glaze over. Not me. I adored every description of every sandgrain, seagrass, shell and sunset.
Marsh is not a swamp. Marsh is a space of light, where grass grows in water, and water flows into the sky.Slow moving creeks wander, carrying the orb of the sun with them to the sea, and long-legged birds lift with unexpected grace - as though not built to fly - against the roar of a thousand snow geese ...
Kya was a strong character. I loved her independence, her stubbornness, her capacity to love and be a friend. Her vulnerability. The secondary characters were wonderful also, ""Jumpin'"", in particular.  Late one evening she took her first novel, Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier, from Ma's bookshelf and read about love.
The creatures of the marsh became her friends.She could rely on them.There was no judgement.But two boys became an integral part of her life also.
Trapped inside,Love is a caged beast,Eating its own flesh.Love must be free to wander,To land upon its chosen shoreAnd breathe.

""I must let you go now.Let you go.Love is too often the answer for staying. Too seldom the reason for going.I drop the lineAnd watch you drift away.All along,You thoughtThe fiery currentOf your lover's breastPulled you to the deep.But it was my heart-tideReleasing youTo float, adrift,With seaweed.""
It is a debut novel by this author and, I, for one, think it is stunning. I usually read on Kindle but if I truly love a book a lot, I do get the print version. My order for the Hardcover has already been sent and I look forward to seeing it on my bookshelf with all my other favourites.I do hope that when the film is made that the makers do the book justice. It's going to be a tough call but, hopefully, it can be done.My review might seem vague but you are better off not knowing too much prior to reading it.
""You came again,blinding my eyeslike the shimmer of sun upon the sea.Just as I feel freethe moon casts your face upon the sill.Each time I forget youyour eyes haunt my heart and it falls still.And so farewelluntil the next time you come,until at last I do not see you.”

193,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16323644-amanda---mrs-b-s-book-reviews,Rating 5 out of 5,"*https://mrsbbookreviews.wordpress.comDelia Owens, the author of Where the Crawdads Sing, has always considered the wilderness to be her best friend, living and devoting her life to nature. Owens is a wildlife scientist and the publication of her award-winning non fiction pieces indicate her expertise in nature based witting. Owens has always wanted to write a fiction based novel that explores how isolation affects a person. Ten years in the making, Where the Crawdads Sing has been released to critical and popular acclaim. This novel has occupied a spot on the lucrative New York Times bestseller list and it has attracted the attention of literary ambassador Reese Witherspoon with her popular book club. Where the Crawdads Sing explores isolation, abandonment and loneliness in a way that I have never encountered before, along with romance, mystery, ecology and murder.Where the Crawdads Sing begins with the urban myth of the ‘Marsh Girl’. In an isolated township in North Carolina, there have been whispers about the existence of a girl who is at one with the local marshlands. When a local football star is found dead, the suspicion immediately falls on the notorious ‘Marsh Girl’, who is also known as Kya Clark. For years Kya has carved out a life for herself in the marsh, it is the only place where she feels at home. Although Kya has evaded social workers and formal education, she is incredibly intelligent and sneaky too, evading capture by local authorities after she was abandoned by all members of her family. Eventually, Kya, who yearns for connection, takes a chance and she forms a relationship with two males. Both these men have a huge impact on Kya’s life, in both good and bad ways. These relationships define, but also break Kya. Where the Crawdads Sing is a beautiful love song to the natural world and the marshlands of North Carolina. This novel offers the reader a very different experience of growing up, youth, first love, romance, friendship, secrets, mystery, murder and justice. It is hands down a truly unforgettable read.2019 is turning out to be a stellar year for books and reading. While I am only into my first reading month of the year, I think I have discovered a book that will almost certainly remain on my list of top reads for 2019. Where the Crawdads Sing is a magnificent novel, so exquisite in its examination on the natural world. It also offers a scathing insight into isolation, a plot full of twists and it is populated by incredibly vivid characters. It is not often that a book renders me completely wordless, but this is how I felt going into writing a review that does this truly beautiful book justice.The best place to begin with this book and my impressions on it is to start with the lead, Kya Clark. When we first meet Kya she is around six years old. She is surrounded by a gaggle of siblings, an abusive father and a mother at crisis point. The abandonment of Kya’s mother has a ripple effect. It sends her siblings, and eventually her father away. Kya must learn to fend for herself from a very young age. Kya’s isolation, abandonment and loneliness is captured perfectly by Owen, early on in the novel,‘Surely Ma would come back for her birthday, so the morning after the harvest moon she put on the calico dress and stared down the lane. Kya willed Ma to be walking toward the shack, still in her alligator shoes and long skirt. When no one came, she got the pot of grits and walked through the woods to the seashore.’The reader soon develops and attachment to Kya, I know I did. I felt so frustrated that her family, each and every one of them, even the extended family, didn’t come to find her. Granted Kya avoids the help of social services, but it just made me so sad this young girl was left to fend for herself from such a young age and for such a long period of time. Somehow, Kya flourishes, she becomes one with the marsh. She turns to help from an unlikely source, a coloured couple named Jumpin’ and Mabel. This friendship reminds us that sometimes race and class know no bounds. It was a touching connection that I found quiet joy in reading.Where the Crawdads Sing contains a compelling narrative structure. The book spans a great length of time. It opens in 1952, with the culmination of events reaching a climax in 1970. The book eventually closes off in the year 2009. This is a sprawling novel, but I honestly didn’t notice the years or the time float past. The murder of local identity Chase Andrews helped to set up the main mystery aspect of the novel and was one, not the sole reason, why I was unable to draw myself away from this novel. Chase’s death and the eventual court case connected to his passing is incredibly emotional and unjust. Owens uses the case as a vehicle to explore themes of social inequality, racism, class differences, prejudice and small-minded community attitudes.Not only is this a murder mystery piece, a rich coming of age story and a romance of sorts, it is also a meditation on isolation. When Kya eventually decides to make a connection with someone, which is what she craves, she is hurt again and again. It pulls her further back into her world as a recluse, but the results are not all bad as she finds her niche in the natural world. Using her home as a sanctuary and as inspiration, Kya paints and records what she observes. Her activities eventually attract positive attention and her work is selected for publication. Kya’s intuition, intelligence and aptitude for understanding the natural world reminds us that sometimes a formal education does not always negate success.Another aspect of the novel that resonated with me in a surprising way was the use of poetry, which is filtered through much of the novel. Kya uses this poetry as a way to understand her thoughts and feelings. She also draws on poetry to make a connection to what has happened to her. I don’t have a huge appreciation for poetry, but I just loved the way it was utilised in this novel.‘Winged soul, you danced the skies,And startled dawn with shrilling cries,You followed sails and braved the sea,Then caught the wind back to me.’There is just so much about this remarkable novel that worked for me. From the resounding themes, the unforgettable characters, the wild setting and the intriguing murder mystery, which delivered a final parting twist, that I didn’t see coming. It will wind you, it will definitely make you feel, perhaps even scream with the injustice of it all, but most of all, Where the Crawdads Sing will remain in your heart.‘In nature – out yonder where the crawdads sing – these ruthless seeming behaviours actually increase the mother’s number of young over her lifetime, and thus her genes for abandoning offspring in times of stress are passed on to the next generation’.*Thanks is extended to Hachette Australia for providing a free copy of this book for review purposes."

My little marsh girl didn’t like that one bit, let me tell you. 🤣 Throw in dozens of jokes riffing every time there was a line with some variation of somehow-written-with-a-straight-face ‘his boat/canoe entering her lagoon,’ and there was much more entertainment in the reading than was being provided by the book itself.Where the Crawdads Sing tells its story in two timelines. The first timeline runs from 1952 to late 1969, and is a coming of age story of the “Marsh Girl,” Kya Clark. Kya was a little girl in 1952 when her mother abandoned the family, followed swiftly by several older siblings, her beloved brother Jodie, and finally her abusive father. She finds a way to survive and raise herself, alone, in her marsh shack. And raise herself she does, transforming herself from sad, pitiable little marsh girl into super hot young woman marsh girl, whose heart is broken by two different men. In the second timeline, beginning in late October 1969, a local man named Chase Andrews has been found dead. I’ll give you one guess who will eventually be put on trial for his murder.The early portions of Where the Crawdads Sing, with Kya growing up and finding a way to survive, were solid. The marsh environment is described at a high level of detail that you will find either fascinating or tediously boring. There are some interesting connections drawn by the author between the characters and wild creatures, implying that we are not so different or evolved from our animal past. And Kya struggling to understand why her mother left her behind has a genuine poignancy to it. That said, I really have no idea how Where the Crawdads Sing is as widely read, or as popular, as it is. As a matter of structure, the two timelines are wildly out of balance. You’ll read for an hour about Kya as a little girl, then drop into the present timeline for a five-minute chapter where two cops will find an alleged clue, and then take off for another hour in the past. That is, until the trial, when suddenly the majority of the story is in the present with only occasional flashbacks. And the story is told at a pace that’s at best slow and at worst boring.But the mystery/courtroom drama storyline in Where the Crawdads Sing is a much bigger problem. A married man who sleeps with anything that moves is found dead, and the cops breeze past what you and I might call ‘the usual suspects’ in such a circumstance. The evidence against Kya is so thin there’s no way it would have gone to trial. And in the final pages, when you finally learn how Chase died, you will say to yourself “but that makes absolutely no sense,” but it will be too late, as you’ll have already finished the book. Honestly, the ending was so disappointing that it dropped my rating from 3 stars to 2. Not recommended, and Reese Witherspoon owes me an apology 😄."

196,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book has been on the bestseller list for so long, and I know I am very very late to it. The reviews have always been tempting for the most part, though there are some mixed ones, and I can fully understand why.  A book where the character, theme & vivid writing overshadows the overall story & plot. If anything, this book is a tribute to nature. The story is told in two timelines – late 1950s and 1969-70. In the first timeline (in a fictitious town in North Carolina), Kya Clark is only 7 years old, one of five siblings, with an abusive and alcoholic father, living in a run-down house in marshy land. Gradually, her mother and all her brothers & sisters leave home. She was closest in age to Jodie and he is the last to leave. After a few months, her father does not return as well. Kya is determined not to end up in foster care, having heard bad stories about it, and dodges the authorities, and learns to live in the wild (mostly by selling shells & fishing). She learns a lot about the marsh ecosystem and how life thrives there. People in town refer to her as the ‘Marsh Girl’, and mostly avoid her, except for Jumpin’ and his wife Mable who support her. In a few years, she grows fond of Tate who teaches her to read. However, Tate has his ambitions and goes off to college, with promises to return. Disillusioned waiting for Tate, Kyra is next involved with Chase Andrews, trusting him as he proposes a long-term relationship. In the second timeline (1969-70), Chase Andrews is found dead and it looks like he fell from a fire tower into the swamp. There is not much at the crime scene but a series of other observations cause the police to take in Kya as a suspect accusing her of pushing Chase to his death. The descriptions of nature – the marsh, the gulls, the waters, the throbbing life are all vivid and haunting, and certainly among the best I have read in a work of fiction. Kya’s character is absolutely lovely as she learns to live with loneliness - befriending the birds, the waves and the greenery. Her pain, her longing and hopes as she struggles to cope are very well written. At the same time, I have to say that the crime segment is very ordinary – the plot, timing.. ( For instance - Why would Chase Andrews agree to such an odd hour meeting? How could the perpetuator depend on a lot of circumstances to be in place to enact the plan? How was the scene cleaned up thoroughly? Why should the shell necklace Chase wore be taken?........). Some of the experiences Kya goes through at 7 years of age also do not come across as very realistic, but work well to build her into a loveable character! I liked the court sequences – especially the closing argument of Kya’s lawyer.A book to be read for some brilliant writing, and less for the crime segment of the story. My rating: 3.75 / 5."

Encontramos neste livro, romance, mistério policial, poesia.Temos a natureza com um papel destacado, o pantanal é no fundo a protecção e o refúgio desta menina.

198,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5778052-judy,Rating 5 out of 5,"An absolutely beautifully written, entrancing novel. Kya, a child of 7 is on her own living in a North Carolina marsh. First her mother left, then her brothers and sisters left one by one, and then her father. Imagine a child trying to manage a home, feed herself, clothe herself, and understand the world. Her life is full of isolation and her fear of people is very real. The book follows Kya's life in the marsh and the very few people she interacts with. The descriptions of the surroundings and nature are brilliant. There is also a mystery here that keeps you wondering (although it was fairly easy to guess what happened).I loved this one and highly recommend it. Delia Owens has a real talent!Thanks to Edelweiss for a review copy."
199,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5922426-bam-cooks-the-books--,Rating 5 out of 5,"In the spring of 1952, a woman walks away from her home in the marshes of coastal North Carolina, never looking back, leaving her five children behind with their drunken father, who has just two settings: silent and loud. Soon the three oldest children slither away too, then thirteen-year-old Jodie, the youngest son, decides to go, leaving six-year-old Kya to fend for herself and her PA. She has to wonder what has she done to send everyone away? Needing people only ends in hurt. Seventeen years later, the body of the popular and handsome Chase Andrews, former high school star quarterback, is found dead at the base of a fire tower. Foul play is suspected and the story of the murder investigation is interspersed with Kya's coming of age story. Kya grows up wild in those marshes, hiding from strangers, avoiding the truant officer and by the age of ten, she is entirely on her own. The people in the small town of Barkley Cove shun her, calling her Marsh Girl. Her savior is the old black man Jumpin', who buys mussels from her so she can afford groceries, gas and supplies from his general store, while his wife brings her hand-me-down clothes. Kya grows into a beautiful young woman and soon attracts the attention of a couple of young men. One teaches her to read and brings her books, but the other just wants to use and abuse her--both betray her and break her heart. ""From somewhere very deep, she made herself a promise never to trust or love anyone again.""Kya is an unforgettable character, broken yet strong, beautiful and wild but multi-faceted and talented. I guarantee her story will break your heart. As always with books set in North Carolina, the land itself plays a major role in this story. Kya loves every inch of it and every critter in it. The story is beautifully written, sprinkled with touching poems throughout. So what does that title mean: where the crawdads sing? ""Just means far in the bush where the critters are wild, still behaving like critters.""Highly recommend this book! I've added it to my list of other favorites set in North Carolina, including Thomas Wolfe's Look Homeward, Angel; Redemption Road by John Hart; and If the Creek Don't Rise by Leah Weiss. I am so pleased that author Delia Owens frequently refers to Aldo Leopold's classic A Sand County Almanac throughout the book as one that inspires Kya--another favorite of mine.I received an arc of this book from the publisher via NetGalley for my honest review. Sincere thanks!"
200,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,Rating 4 out of 5,"This novel had so much hype, between its listing as a pick for Book of the Month and a monthly pick for Reese Witherspoon's book club, that I almost didn't want to read it. But I was headed to a long weekend in Beaufort, SC, with a landscape similar to that of the book, and decided to listen to it on the way there. We got about 10% in listening at 1x speed. After returning home and finishing up some podcast listening, I returned to the book at 1.75x speed and finished it in a few days.The central story in the novel is that of Kya, a girl who lives in the isolated marshes of North Carolina in the 1950s. Due to several family situations, she is forced to largely raise herself, learning to cook, clean, and navigate a boat long before she learns to read. At some point a 1969 storyline steps in with the occasional chapter, introducing a murder mystery in the closest town to Kya. I loved this book for its landscape, and for the survival narrative. I liked the idea of Kya developing a deep understanding of the marsh and its creatures, and being able to represent that artistically. I enjoyed the light mystery of the murder/death. I liked that she created a small found family of sorts with the people of color and a few other real marsh dwellers that had an overall positive impact on her life, probably saving her life. I found it harder to fully give myself over to the idea of Kya learning to read and then going on to master high levels of learning without any other expert guiding her understanding. It tastes a little of the kind of narrative where a person is redeemed by their extra goodness rather than just letting them be average or uneducated but still valuable because they are human, but this is so entrenched in American lit I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

I found this book extremely annoying and insufferable, I wish I could actually UN-read it. I can never get this time back. ____________________________*2020 Update* Was recently commiserating with a friend who is currently reading this, and I remembered how much I didn't like this book. Zero interest in the human characters, and too close to YA for my taste. WAY overhyped.____________________________Honestly, I was expecting more with all the rave reviews. It wasn’t overtly bad, but it felt like a YA version of The Notebook meets a swampy-Disney love story. *Almost charming ... at times. Suspense level: zero. My favorite characters were the cat, Sunday Justice, and North Carolina.*Vivid swamp/marsh imagery, meet-cute couple, and the tamest murder mystery I think I’ve ever read. The first half was pretty slow, and felt very tween-y. Second half ""picked up"" as the characters aged (/time jumps). Curious what age group the Reese Witherspoon movie will target. My guess: Old ladies and youths."

203,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/121347338-jen,Rating 5 out of 5,"Loved, loved, loved this book! Definitely one of my favourites of the year😀 Delia Owens created a complete story with this novel and all aspects; characters, setting, plot and atmosphere, were fully fleshed out for me. Every time I picked it up, I was immersed in Kya's world. I listened to the audiobook, and Cassandra Campbell's narration was both fluid and haunting. I know this is another late to the party review (sorry, being a parent stymied some of my reading🤷🏼‍♀️😂) but if you haven't read it, I would highly recommend.The first scenes start in the early 1950's and Kya is known in her town in North Carolina as ""the Marsh Girl"". The town is segregated racially and by wealth as well and Kya's family is on the very poor end of things. Her life is more than challenging and at at times, I had to pause knowing how little she was when she was struggling so hard. Her existence was a solitary one but Kya was wise beyond her years and she definitely wiggled into my heart quickly. The book has two storylines, with narrative running concurrently between 1969, when Chase, the former star of the town football team turns up dead and also one from 1950 0nward, describing Kya's life and development to present. Although intertwined, there really are two wonderful stories unfolding. One is a slow meandering murder mystery that gives you a tickling bit of anxiety as you read the other story, which is an absorbing telling of Kya's life growing up to the point of Chase's death.There was so much that I loved in the book that I could never detail it all, it amounts to the novel's entirety, but I will mention that the natural metaphors were so connecting for me. I loved how in Kya's achingly solitary life, she was able to link with her environment and I think it added richly to the book. I'm sure that is directly reflective of Delia Owens being a wildlife scientist and spending her life devoted to animals, the title itself coming from something her Mother said to her as a child. (for fans, be sure to have a look into Delia's own life as she has had one rich in wildlife work, including time in Africa)There were also so many wonderful supporting characters in the story and I felt all were fully developed. This is one of those books that catches you up with how it was written so don't grab it if you are looking for a fast paced thriller. It was so more to me than that, it was an achingly beautiful historical tale of a girl's life, watching her become an adult almost completely on her own and I was completely sucked in and immersed.If you haven't already read it, I ++ recommend that you try to find out where the crawdads sing🦞"
204,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68985512-tmr,Rating 5 out of 5,"A 2019 pick in favorites, and I agree with the choice whole-heartedly.This novel talks about a lot of issues, like seclusion, not fitting into society's ideal image of a proper upholding rights citizen, taking things into your own hands when no one else will help, love that can tear you apart, and standing out on your own. And the book does tackle these issues brilliantly, with good character development from The Marsh Girl and her family and all...and how she slowly transforms from a girl scared of the world to a strong young woman who conquers the world after all. It was just so brilliant gosh. The writing, the character development, the dialogues themselves, the love and understanding and compassion I felt for each character introduced, and the plot in general was just so fascinating.I just have no words to express my admiration, inspiration and love for this novel which had helped me out in such a dark time. Forever grateful to the author for publishing this. And recommending it y'all who love these sorts of novels. You will not be disappointed. If you are, message me then. Otherwise, enjoy this novel, y'all. Until the next read,TMR"

I did not find the start slow at all; I was invested in Kya’s story from the moment Ma didn’t turn back to wave goodbye at the end of the lane as she always did when going into town. Which happens on, like, page 2. I loved Tate. Sure he was frustrating at times, but so was Kya. None more so than Chase though 😠 I found it so interesting that at the start of the book, I was concerned about Kya being alone in marshland, but by the time of the trial I was anxious for her to get back to being alone in her marshland! The subtle ways Owens wrote about loneliness and isolation in nature was so poignant, and really helped me ache for Kya, & feel like I was the one alone in the marsh collecting mussels and counting coins. I was so taken by this story, and already want to reread it!"

Once I saw the trailer for the movie, which yes, I know Witherspoon was producing, I was intrigued. I know that at some point I’ll see the movie so I knew I had to read the book first since I’m a creature of habit and always try to read the book before seeing the movie.Definitely caught my attention from page one even though I thought I had solved the murder about half way through the book, which bummed me out but what a twist at the end!Excellent book and I recommend it to everyone!

Because... wow. What a spectacular story. I love going into books having no real idea of what's going to happen and being entranced at the end.Especially because with this book, I didn't realize how invested I was until the last 50 or so pages. The whoosh of breath I let out at the end of the court case only to be truly shocked by the end? I can't wait to see this story brought to life. I think it's the perfect story TO be brought to life. It has so many concepts that will translate so well to the screen, and I honestly have no idea how many books I can actually say that about.I've always found so much beauty in my alone time, mostly because growing up, I was that shy girl with a book. My family also has a camp out in the Adirondack's where I spent most of my summers as a kid and that kept me away from really making a true group of friends. I went to school and was friends with everyone simply because I didn't have a set place for me. I related to Kya a lot in that, but I think what really got my attention is that she was never truly content in her alone. She wanted to be alone, but at the same time, wanted to be a part of a group. Delia Owens wrote about that in her authors note, and it was something I really connected with and felt through Kya and through the writing of this story.How beautiful. Thank you Taylor Swift for writing a song about this story that gave me the extra push to finally give it a chance. Can't wait to see what a movie can add to it.- Paige"

212,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,Rating 4 out of 5,"I had to overcome my prejudices before I could enjoy this book. When a novel has been a big bestseller for as long as this one has (more than a year and counting!), I assume that it will be fairly middlebrow and won't have much literary value. At some point I had read the first few pages of ""Crawdads"" and didn't care for it, so I assumed I wouldn't like the rest of the novel.However, I am also a curious reader and wanted to know what all the fuss was about. Why are so many people raving about this book? So when a friend at book club said she had also loved it, I suggested ""Crawdads"" could be our next pick, knowing that it would force me to commit to reading it in full. Because I hadn't liked the novel when I started it in print, I decided it would be best to listen to the audio version, read by the talented Cassandra Campbell.About an hour into the book, I started to get into it. Several hours in, I was fully invested in Kya, our heroine, and raced through the rest of the book. Without spoiling any details from the plot, I can say that I loved how Kya managed to survive despite incredible odds against her, and how clever she was. I also liked that, in different ways, ""Crawdads"" reminded me of two other Southern novels that I have loved: Lee's ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and Conroy's ""The Prince of Tides.""When our book club met to discuss this book, it was funny how each of us mentioned that we had been prejudiced against reading this book, but we all ended up liking it. Now I understand why it's still such a popular novel. Recommended."

Es de los mejores libros que he leído este año.Me ha parecido una novela redonda, por muchos aspectos:• La manera de plasmar la vida y la personalidad de Kya, abandonada por su familia a la edad de 7 años en una cabaña medio perdida. La soledad, el rechazo de la gente, la dureza de su vida, sus miedos y a la vez su valentía, su inteligencia, su amor por la marisma...y   qué decir de la evolución del personaje: es asombrosa. • La ambientación es espectacular: las marismas, el océano, el pueblo de la América Profunda en los años cincuenta y sesenta, sus gentes y sus prejuicios.• La estructura es perfecta, alternando dos líneas temporales distintas: por una parte, la vida de Kya a través de los años, por otra el año de la muerte inesperada de un chico del pueblo. Esto hace que haya una intriga constante. • Hay una acusación de asesinato por la muerte del chico y un juicio. El desarrollo del juicio es una genialidad. • Los sentimientos, tanto de amistad como de amor, están muy bien reflejados. • Todos los personajes están perfectamente construidos. En fin, una novela de las buenas, buenas. En algunos momentos, la lectura se hace lenta, pero debe ser así, para captar cada matiz.Un 10."

While the reading is good, the story is so nonsensical- a 6 year old left alone in a shack raises herself, living in the same shack, using the same boat, and no one lifts a hand to help her? In more than 20 years, the boat never breaks down, the house doesn't need repairs and she's able to wear the same clothes for many years....she's got long hair that she says is ratty and tangled but description s of it has it down her back, luxurious...she's gorgeous but bathing is optional until in her 20s...she has sex with a philanderer but never gets a vd and not once apparently does she get sick. No flu, cold, nothing....she never got shots and apparently has the immune system of a super hero because she stepped on a nail and never got tetanus....I kept reading so I'd finish and the ending is unexpected but it's generally a boring book where day after day, she's alone in the marsh...."

I was unsure if I'd be in the unpopular opinion category when I first started to read it but I'm glad I was wrong.Kya is a young girl who is growing up in the Marsh. She lives with her Pa, Ma and siblings. Slowly each of her siblings except one leaves. Then her Ma leaves to escape the abuse and then her brother. Now she's left alone with a Pa who drinks often and is an abuser. How will Kya ever survive? She tries to make the best of it with Pa until one day he doesn't come back and now Kya must grow up in the Marsh by herself.Kya does not go to school and learns life lessons through nature. She also has a boy named Tate come and teach her things like how to read. Over the the years Kya experiences loss, love, survival and more. Until one day of of the boys she thought was her forever ends up dead. Kya, who has only ever known the marsh, ends up as part of a murder trial. The town already has prejudice against her and this may not end well for Kya...I don't think I could say anything that would give this book the praise it deserves for the beautiful writing. It may be one, if not the most, beautifully written novels I've ever read. The descriptions of nature and North Carolina where it took place was incredible. I was easily able to imagine/transport myself to where Kya and all the other characters live. I think this is such a great base for an important story.I try not to attach myself to characters but I got attached to Kya. I was rooting for her consistently and I actually got anxious towards the end waiting to read and find out what happened. I did not even care what or if she did anything they claimed she did, I just wanted her to get the life she deserved and worked towards. She was dealt a terrible hand of cards and to read how forgiving and strong she was through it all was truly inspiring.I could really sing the praises of this book all day.

It may be that modern popular fiction is just not for me, but I really have to question the near-unanimous and orgasmic praise for a book that contains:• The main character ending up in a situation that tests the limit of any suspension of disbelief,• A less-than-half-baked ""mystery"" that is embarrassingly predictable and uninteresting,• A ""shocking"" twist at the end that completely undermines a lot of what the novel was trying to accomplish,• A paint-by-numbers YA love story,• Stereotype characters galore (Johnny Football Hero, Magical Negro, Drunk Dad, Mean Popular Girls, all the classics),• So much bad sex writing,• Attempting to use poetry as a way to convey intelligence and depth of thought (hey, they like poetry, they MUST be some o' them smart folks!)...• .....and then repeatedly using eye-rollingly awful poetry throughout,• A whole lot of painful ""southern hick"" dialect with a boatload of standard southern similes (""she's as slippery as a greased up hog,"" etc.), and • A decent sense of atmosphere but painfully mundane prose and genuinely terrible dialogue.Two stars instead of one only because I love a courtroom scene. I can't help but wonder if this book's popularity is a result of marketing gone wild, but maybe I am just a hipster elitist snob who can't get into a bestseller and shouldn't be allowed in a book club."

At first I didn't think I was going to like this book, because it started off as a slow burn, but as I read on it for better. Where the Crawdad's Sing is a story of survival, hope, love, loss, loneliness, determination, and strength. Kya Clark, known as ""Marsh Girl"", doesn't know what her real name is which is Catherine Danielle Clark because no one has ever told her. This story goes back and forth in time. Kya and her family live on the outskirts of town in North Carolina, in the marsh. Kya was 6 years old when her mother abandoned the family and Kya didn't know why. A few months after her mother left, all of her siblings left, and Kya was to live with her drunk, abusive, not around father, which left Kya to feed and care for herself. Kya never went to school so she didn't know how to read and count change to go to the grocery store. When Kya was a bit older she went to school for one day, but she was asked to spell dog but instead she spelled God and all the other children laughed at her. Where the Crawdads Sing was such a good book, I was hooked from the first page and couldn't put it down. If you're looking for a good book to read I totally recommend reading this one!!!"

Descrierea mlaștinii și a întreg ecosistemului, m-au impresionat cel mai tare. E o carte tare frumos și sensibil scrisă, cu personaje bine conturate. Am trăit fiecare emoție alaturi de Kya, iar Tate mi-a plăcut tare mult. Scena în care o învață cum să citească e atât de profundă, iar modul în care o sprijină în orice situație e atât de dulce, te face puțin să visezi. Săltărețu e un alt personaj care mi-a ajuns la suflet, iar toate regulile vremii mi-au amintit cât de norocoasă sunt. Romanul e unul vizual, mi-am închipuit percărușii, plaja, scoicile și toate acele tablouri bogat colorate, cu siguranță voi vedea și filmul, dar deși înțeleg hype-ul din jurul cărții mi-ar fi plăcut ca partea de mister, ca povestea din prezent să fie mai prezentă. Cartea prezintă multe clișee, it has some Nicholas Sparks's vibes, iar finalul e previzibil, problema mea cu această poveste fiind a doua parte a cărții, pe care am simțit-o lipsită de originalitate.. dar și așa, dacă ești în căutarea unui loc liniștit, plin de pace, acolo unde cântă racii, este locul potrivit, care te primește cu brațele deschise, cu toate imperfecțiunile tale. ”De multe ori, iubirea nu merge șnur. Dar și când dă greș, tot te conectează cu alții și, până la urmă, asta-i tot ce ai, legătura.””Nimeni n-a ajuns vreodată să-și umple creierul cu totul. Cu toții suntem ca niște girafe care nu-și folosesc gâturile ca să ajungă la frunzele cele mai de sus.” ”Nu poți fugi de fiecare data când nu-ți convine. Uneori trebuie să discuți lucruri. Să le înfrunți.”
”Dăduse o șansă iubirii; acum nu mai voia decât să umple spațiile goale. Să-și domolească singurătatea și să-și ușureze inima.”
”Femelele de licurici atrag masculii cu semnale mincinoase și-i mânâncă; femelele călugăriță își devorează propria parteneri. Insectele femele știu cum să se descurce cu iubiții.”
”Rămânem împreună chiar și-n noroi, mai ales în noroi.”
”Înainte de jocul penelor, singurătatea ajunsese o prelungire naturală a Kyei, ca un braț. Acum însă parcă făcuse rădăcini în ea și-i apăsa pieptul.””N-ai grijă, îi zicea el, de fiecare dată când citești o să pricepi câte un pic mai mult.”

”Cât de mult vrei să lași de la tine ca să înfrângi singurătatea?”

”Unele părți din noi vor fi mereu ce-am fost cândva, ce-a trebuit să îndurăm - demult, tare demult.”

”Unele lucruri, cred, nu pot fi explicate, doar iertate sau nu.”

 Nu ne pasă Că înserarea înșală Vedem culori viiȘi nu mai aflăm Că soarele s-a ascuns În pământPănă să-l vedem cum arde. Apusurile sunt o deghizare Acoperă urmeAcoperă minciuni. "

The theme is executed very well too. One of the few movie adaptations from novels that I personally enjoyed. So happy it didn't disappoint.**********This book never failed to break my heart like every 5 chapters. I honestly expected this book to focus more on the mystery stuff but it turns out it was more than what it seems.I'm deeply immersed to stories which follow the characters as they grow up, here we learn about 
Kya
—a child that was abandoned by her mother at such a young age. One by one her siblings also left. Being the youngest, she got no choice but to continue living with her abusive father who also eventually left her on her own. Living alone in the marsh, she found herself struggling to survive and hoping that someday her mother and siblings will come back to her. Time passed, and people started calling her the Marsh Girl. 
Surrounded by nothing but nature, she started craving for someone's love and attention.
 So, when some guy showed some interest in her she felt alive. Kya desperately clings to anyone who wanted to spend some time with her.One day, her quiet life ended as the news about the death of a popular guy named 
Chase
 broke in town. It so happens that Kya and Chase had been seeing each other before and thanks to that she became the prime suspect to his murder.I can't help but admire how Kya managed to survive on her own, as I watched her get by everyday by being resourceful. She is the embodiment of independence itself. 
She taught me that there is no one in this world who can truly save us but ourselves.
 Kya doesn't need a knight in shining armor to save her. Eventually, I found myself deeply attached to her character as she is so well-written. I can feel her pain and totally can't blame her for being who she was. Kya got some trust issues for all those people who did nothing but leave and made her suffer. Both my head and my heart hurt toward the ending. Though, it was heavily foreshadowed in the beginning I was totally shocked how the story ended.
Where the Crawdads Sing
 has shown how prejudice can affect someone's life. Despite all the judgements we received, there is always someone who can accept you for who you truly are. Overall, this book really moved me so it deserves 5 stars!"

Mucho podría hablar de este libro por todos los temas que toca pero me quedo con la delicadeza que ha tenido la autora a la hora de tratarlos. Ha construido un libro emotivo que fluye, como el agua en las marismas, te va nutriendo con lo que relata, no se recrea, simplemente avanza como sube la marea en una marisma llena de vida: describiendo los escenarios, viendo como Kya pasa de niña a mujer -con todas las implicaciones que conlleva-, su afan de superación y supervivencia, .... pero también destapa como cuando baja la marea: la soledad y el ansia por relacionarse, la necesidad de integración y de ""calor humano"", el dolor ante el abandono, la desconfianza e imposibilidad de volver a confiar ... hasta llegar a un pantanto putrefacto: violencia de género, maltrato, prejucios, burlas y desprecio de niños y no tan niños, discriminación racial y social, ...Me ha gustado la analogía que hace entre los insectos y determinadas conductas humanas, aunque menos mal que : ""La devoción de Tate acabó por convencerla de que el amor humano es mucho más que las peculiares conductas de emparejamiento de las criaturas de la marisma. Pero la vida también le había enseñado que ese antiguo gen de la supervivencia seguía presente de forma indeseable entre los recovecos y entresijos del código genético del hombre.""Tal vez algún aspecto esté idealizado, suavizado o resulte poco creíble, pero he disfrutado con su lectura.

Both many of the good and many of the bad things that happen are not credible. I don't often leave a book unfinished, but this kept getting on my nerves more and more, and as Maxine Waters would say, I'm ""reclaiming my time""! Also the audiobook was unimpressive. Cassandra Campbell is not a narrator I enjoy listening to, even when the book is really good. She should stick to chick lit. Although this one reads very much like chick lit at times. If you enjoy depressing southern lit that often begs believability and you'd like to learn more about the North Carolina marshlands, then I recommend this book. Only for you, though. No one else. I really love the area of NC she writes about here and I love birds and animals and nature. I even enjoy poetry. I love a good romance mixed into a historical story. I enjoy crime dramas. But this one missed me completely, in spite of all of that. Maybe it was trying to do too much. And what's with all of the rave reviews for this? Holy hell. Reclaiming my time. This one just wasn't for me. Freedom, sweet freedom!"

It has broad appeal as a mystery, a fantasy, a romance, a literary work, a travelogue of sorts (in time and place and ecology) and is gently infused with non-fiction zoology wholly relevant and additive to the story.The fantasy element is that Kya's books are published, resulting in personal and professional breakthroughs.Throughout, Ms. Owens' background as a zoologist and naturalist shines while never overwhelming the story. Beyond the setting and the perfect dialect (and all the story elements mentioned above), this book is refreshing because none, I mean NONE, of the characters are cliched. All are thought through, explained, and portrayed in a clear-eyed manner.Great twist at the end!Highly, highly recommended to all readers."

As night fell, Tate walked back toward the shack. But when he reached the lagoon, he stopped under the dark canopy and watched hundreds of fireflies beckoning far into the dark reaches of the marsh. Way out yonder, where the crawdads sing.
I had to wait a few months to get Where the Crawdads Sing from the library – this is definitely a book with a lot of buzz – but despite its hype, its long list of four and five star reviews on Goodreads, and Reese Witherspoon's stamp of approval on the cover, this read fell totally flat for me. It started with a lot of promise – a little girl is abandoned in the marsh by her family one by one, and as we watch her growing up and taking care of herself in one timeline, a murder investigation and courtroom drama plays out in another – and then it all fizzled out into bad romance, bad mystery, bad storytelling. Just not for me.The story is set in the North Carolina coastal marshlands, and in the beginning, I thought that what author Delia Owens got right was the nature writing:
Marsh is not swamp. Marsh is a space of light, where grass grows in water, and water flows into the sky. Slow-moving creeks wander, carrying the orb of the sun with them to the sea, and long-legged birds lift with unexpected grace – as though not built to fly – against the roar of a thousand snow geese.
But eventually, as Kya – alone in her shack in the marsh from the age of seven – becomes a keen observer of the nature around her (and after being taught to read by a former friend of her long-gone brother, she becomes an educated expert on the local flora and fauna), it became cringe-worthy to me the way that Kya could relate all human behaviour to what she observes in the critters of the marsh. Also annoying to me: that Owens couldn't have someone cook or send out for a meal without listing the five items on their plate, and I hated the amount of poetry that Kya recited in her head; would eventually skip over the stanzas. And the metaphorical language that I thought suited the nature writing felt overblown when used elsewhere:
• Soon after they arrived, he took up drinking and poker at the Swamp Guinea, trying to leave that foxhole in a shot glass.• Kya was rigid at first, not accustomed to yielding to hugs, but this didn't discourage Mabel, and finally Kya went limp against the comfort of those pillows.• Kya leaned over gently, as if to kiss a baby. The microscope's light reflected in her dark pupils, and she drew in a breath as a Mardi Gras of costumed players pirouetted and careened into view. Unimaginable headdresses adorned astonishing bodies so eager for more life, they frolicked as though caught in a circus tent, not a single bead of water.
And, okay, I can accept that despite going to school for one day of her life, with all her solitary hours to devote to reading and observations, Kya could basically teach herself college-level biology, but I couldn't buy that the first time she's alone with a boy she has a crush on and he points out an interesting shell, this is the reply of a conversation-avoiding hermit:It's an ornate scallop, Pecten ornatus. I only see them rarely. There are many of that genus here, but this particular species usually inhabits regions south of this latitude because these waters are too cool for them.I found the writing itself to be clunky and overwrought, and once Kya was old enough to yearn for romance, the narrative went to uninteresting (to me) places. And I don't even want to talk about the overall plot and the dissatisfying ending; don't want to talk about the shallow characterisations and improbable developments. This just wasn't for me, but I will allow that is is apparently of wide appeal."
231,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"This was a good read, but I didn't find it great book. I had several problems with it. First of all, some of my more mundane complaints: Why do the residents of the coast travel to Asheville to go shopping? Aren't there much closer cities (Raleigh, for instance). Also, how can there be no mention of hurricanes? This is supposed to be a book about living close to nature in coastal North Carolina. My biggest problem, though, has to do with narrative structure. The narration leads us to assume that we are getting the thoughts of Kya (limited omniscience). But we go through all the jail/trial chapters without really knowing what she is thinking. She had to be thinking, ""I hope I get away with this,"" struggling with some sort of doubt or guilt. I thought it was likely that she killed Chase, but dismissed that thought during these chapters because for the first three quarters of the book we've been inside her mind. But during her stay in the jail, we get a lot about her relationship with the cat, nothing about the mental struggle she must have been going through. I find this an unfair move on the author's part. She violates her own structure in order to create a surprise ending. That means we don't really know Kya, have never really known her. Owens sacrifices narrative logic and emotional honesty for plot device. Finally, the Amanda Hamilton poetry motif is a bit troubling. There is a real Amanda Hamilton who has published a chapbook called ""The Dust We Cherish."" A web page on the book says that Hamilton's poems are about ""transition, isolation and almost communicating."" This sounds an awful lot like Kya's story. The sample poem on this web page has the same structure as the poems that appear in the novel (short lines, enjambed, short stanzas). There's no formal acknowledgement of the real Amanda Hamilton by the author. There is, however, an Amanda in the dedication. What's going on here? Who actually wrote the poems that appear in the novel? Amanda Hamilton or Delia Owens? "
232,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5299664-deann,Rating 5 out of 5,"5+ stunning stars to this bookEvery once in a while, a book comes along for me that speaks to my heart and soul. ""Where the Crawdads Sing"" is firmly in that camp. This one easily gets 5 stars from me and is one of my top reads for 2018.The book is set in the coastal marshes of North Carolina and the marshes are a key character in the story. Our main human character is Kya, and the story follows her from the time she is a small girl, living in a shack in the marshes with her parents and siblings. Unfortunately, the family dynamic breaks down and Kya lives a very solitary existence with her education coming from the marshes. She becomes a mythical character – the “Marsh Girl” – and struggles to make her way in the world without parental guidance. She becomes an amazing naturalist and expert on the wildlife in the marsh. She craves human connections but has been abandoned by her family and the community. This coming of age story for Kya wormed its way into my heart and I was rooting for her every step of the way to find acceptance, love, and happiness.The language is so descriptive, lushly describing the marshes, the wildlife, and the life Kya has carved out for herself. The story slows down at times but I enjoyed being along for the journey. There is some wonderful poetry throughout the book that complements the story.Another element in the book is the mysterious death of a local man, Chase Andrews. Since Kya was known to spend time with Chase, she becomes a suspect. This book has a fantastic ending and it is such a fitting conclusion to the story.I highly recommend this book if you enjoy becoming immersed in a story with excellent storytelling. There’s a little bit of everything here: murder mystery, love stories, family dysfunction, a wonderful natural setting."

“Please don’t talk to me about isolation. No one has to tell me how it changes a person. I have lived it. I am isolation.”
Where the Crawdads Sing is the hauntingly vivid coming-of-age story of Kya, a young girl abandoned by her family at a very young age, experiencing the trials and tribulations of womanhood, all on her own. With the few glimpses of her life that we saw, it painted a heartbreaking picture of a young girl, who ached for human companionship and affection, and yet somehow found comfort and strength, in the wilderness of the marshes, that shielded her from human life. And even then, despite her belief that she could survive on her own, her heart still yearned for that connection, to make her life more meaningful.“I have to do life alone. But I knew this. I’ve known a long time that people don’t stay.”Oh Kya, the ""marsh girl"" - since your story began, my heart aced for you. She was such an incredible character - resilient in her nature, yet still so conflicted in her desire to just belong and still feel that she's better of not belonging. I felt so much for when she had to explore and experience all the trials and tribulations of womanhood all on her own -the innocence that she had helped shape her into a stronger character, even in her own unique way. The moments when she reflected on the feelings of abandonment and the aching thought that one day her family, her mother, would return - it was so very palpable. I loved how she grew as person - the strength of endurance she showed was so admirable, and her ability to overcome her own weaknesses through her passions made me grow even fonder of her. Resilient in her determination, fierce in her judgment, but still so innocent in human affection, you couldn't help not wanting to show her a bit of kindness. 😥 I know it's a fictional character, but when you can empathize with that aching loss - with the words alone - that is a powerful feeling. And Delia Owens proved that time and time again to me. I especially enjoyed the little details of animal behavior that were mentioned throughout, because I knew that it was subtle reference to the actual human tendencies in the story, as well as an appreciative nod to Ms.Owen's own passion for nature. The poet in me very much so enjoyed all the brief yet poignant poems Kya recited throughout. 💕 I loved that it was a nonlinear narrative - the back and forth between the present and the past heightened the suspense for me leading up to the murder trial. As we were slowly growing with Kya's history, we were also being presented with the idea that she could be the suspect for a murder, as well. And the best part was, that there could have been any one person culpable in the crime! Even I had my doubts - and that element of surprise worked really well for me, even if it wasn't a triumphant moment, but such a calm reveal... If that makes any sense. “Let’s face it, a lot of times love doesn’t work out. Yet even when it fails, it connects you to others and, in the end, that is all you have, the connections.”On a personal note, while I was reading this, a Taylor Swift song played in my head a lot, one lyric in particular. Even if it doesn't exactly relate to the novel's plot, it just really connected with me in a strange way. 😔 Maybe I'm reading too much into it, as I have been prone to do time and time again, but just let me voice it out.- ""Closure"" - Kya could never understand why her mother walked away from her family - that sense of abandonment, that aching hope that she would some day return to her, it played throughout her life. And I just felt, that when her brother came home and told her the truth about her- that sense of closure that she received, gave her a brief bit of happiness, a chance to move a little more forward in life.""I know I'm just a wrinkle in your new life,Guilty, guilty reaching out across the seaThat you put between you and me""To - Jodie, her brother that she never begrudged for leaving her alone with their drunken father, and didn't want to burden with her own troubles when the time came.- Tate, her first love who showed her so much compassion and consideration with his kindness to teach her how to read, introduce her to new things, help her explore her own talents, and STILL not think he was ready to let her be a part of his life- And Chase, that one boy she dared to take a fleeting chance at happiness with, only to be disregarded as someone not worthy to be part of his social circle.All these supporting characters and more shaped Kya into the woman that she became. Even on her own, she rose above the challenges of life and embraced who she was and came out stronger for it. And I think that's what I'll take away the most from this deeply moving and poignant novel. 🙏🏻🙏🏻"
243,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28266634-liza-fireman,Rating 2 out of 5,"Oh my, where do I begin? I read this book because I hoped to find a worthy candidate for my historical fiction (this year is tough!). But oh no, this is not the one. This book is so corny, and it has so many huge holes in the plot and illogical parts, that I had quite hard time to enjoy even some of its good parts. To summarize I can say it is your very usual romantic novel, an insecure not-too-smart girl love by a full-of-himself as&$*e boy. Oh, and does not see that other caring adorable boy that really really loves her. The writing style is so romance, the dialogs are the least convincing possible, the plot does not exist most of the time. I know that I am going to be a unique 2-3 stars among a sea of 5 stars. I know that I am a harsh reviewer. I can also tell that when there is no logic and huge holes I can't ignore them, and probably many others can. You can see this as an advantage of the people that can see beyond this, but I am actually happy that my bar is not to take the bar lower. I want the author to make the work to tailor it well enough that I don't see a hole or an ugly patch. I want my story well woven. Kya is a perfect girl that was abandoned by everyone. Her mom left, then her brothers, then her father. And she was left alone, and grew herself and educated herself. Actually she educated herself so much that from an illiterate girl she became one that read every book on the planet (at least every scientific one). I love this one that makes the whole thing pretty ludicrous: Kya knew from reading Albert Einstein’s books that time is no more fixed than the stars. or reciting poetry in her heart (because every person in this book had something like seven times for poetry in their heart).Not only she self educated herself that much, she also became a scientific expert that wrote books. Not only she write them, it seems that there was at least one copy in every house. And, she was not interested in talking in universities, and they all begged her. She was writing and publishing them for her own fun. So let's take it over the top: Kya published seven more award-winning books. And though she was granted many accolades—including an honorary doctorate from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill—she never once accepted the invitations to speak at universities and museums.And with all of this very logical and make sense initiative, she could not even buy a bus ticket. I am not even going to start talking about her illogical and strange conclusions in her relationship with this Chase.Especially in her dialogs with Chase, Kya seem to have an borderline IQ. Her voice is really of a woman/girl that cannot think one coherent thought. And it does not align at all with any of the rest of her character as we read about her. I do not buy that, and I will go with this Kya, maybe more than the Einstein Kya, but it cannot be both.She knows that she is different, she knows that she does not fit, but for me this childish very extreme childish voice, very stupid if you'll forgive me, doesn't sit at all with the rest. You know I’m different. I don’t fit with other people. I cannot be part of your world. Please, can’t you understand, I’m afraid to be close with anybody ever again. I can’t. And then comes the I can’t live through that parts (which is especially strange/funny because she could face death at one point, and does everything to not help herself because it will be shameful from her perspective to tell people.So I guess, it is nothing special, or maybe it was if I wrote so much about it. I can't see why did this become a hit, you can take my 2 stars or leave it. I guess time will tell if it will survive."
244,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5349403-carolyn-walsh,Rating 4 out of 5,"This beautiful, mesmerizing book has been sitting on my Kindle for months, and don’t know why I hadn’t read it sooner. In gorgeous, lyrical prose the author transports us with her vibrant description of the marshlands in North Carolina. There, life is difficult, and we learn of the heartbreaking struggle to survive poverty and isolation. I confess that it took me a while to be immersed in the life of the main character, and felt remotely detached from the vivid description of the environment, but soon became riveted to the pages.  Kya is living in the marshland in poverty, and each day is a struggle for the family to survive. Her abused mother walks away from home when Kyra is six. Her drunken father often brutalized her older siblings. They left the shack where they lived as soon as they could, causing Kya to be alone with her often-absent and neglectful father. There was little money for food and other necessities. At age fourteen, her father departed leaving her completely alone. Kya, without resources, must struggle to survive against all odds. She is bright and resilient and manages to trade mussels, crayfish and dried fish for meagre food rations and gas for her boat.  Living in poverty and isolation, she is rejected and ridiculed by the townspeople. They refer to her as ‘Marsh Girl’ or ‘Marsh Trash’. She keeps to herself as much as possible. She attended school for only one day and never returned. Barefoot, ragged and dirty, she was harassed by the other children and too ashamed to go back. In her loneliness, she collected and studied feathers and shells. Although illiterate, her keen observations led her to paint the birds, insects, shellfish and vegetation of the Marsh. She also wrote poetry. Her only friends were a kindly coloured man and his wife.  Her shyness and loneliness were assuaged by a growing friendship with a boy, Tate. He taught her to read, which brought the journals of her collections to a new level of expertise as she immersed herself in Biology and Nature books. Tate shares Kya’s profound love and obsession with the living creatures of the Marsh. When she is 15 she believes they are in a long-lasting romance. When he leaves for University to study Marine Biology, he never returns to her as he promised. Kya is devastated, adding Tate to her family members who have all deserted her.  Next, she is in a relationship with Chase, a boy from a wealthy family, handsome, and popular as a High School jock. He deceived her with promises of marriage and a fine home. He has refused to allow her to meet his parents and has been leading her on with lies. Heartbroken, she concentrated on her nature collection, becoming an expert in the field of Marsh biology and botany. Reading about her disappointments and struggles is an emotional experience, making me want the best outcome for Kya.  When Chase was found dead after falling from a high tower, his relationship with Kyra had been the source of gossip in town. She was regarded as the strange and detested loner they called ‘Marsh Trash’. When law enforcement learns of the past relationship, suspicion falls on Kya. With no concrete evidence and unreliable witnesses, the police theorize that Chase did not commit suicide but was murdered by the jilted and vengeful Kya. She is arrested and put on trial. Would the jury which included people who were prejudiced against her for her strange lifestyle convict her of murder? The ending was a stunner, something I would have never have anticipated. The surprising conclusion raised this book to an entirely new level. This is a marvellous ode to nature, a romance, and a murder mystery. It is a tale of endurance, survival and prospering despite daunting circumstances. *4.5* Stars."

Kya is left with her drunken father and her slightly older brother, Jodie, in their shack by the marshes. In a pattern of consecutive abandonments, the Marsh Girl, olive-skinned and illiterate, ends up fending for herself alone in the wilderness by the age of ten. There’s nothing quite like ‘squinting with your ears’ to uncover the marshes’ life and secrets, and Kya has mastered the art of avoiding the town people, who leave the marsh dwellers to themselves. Intelligent, skittish, and untamed, she is unbeatable at hiding in her natural surroundings. In times when it is possible to avoid social services, she receives a helping hand from Jumpin’ and his wife Mabel, and through the years turns into a pretty teenager, then a beautiful young woman shrouded in mystery. Despite her unusual behaviour, her feminine figure attracts boys, some for the wrong reasons.Is she not, after all, ‘marsh trash’?1969Chase Andrews, a married man, and womaniser, is found dead in the swamp below the fire tower. Sheriff Johnson and his deputy, Joe, have reason to suspect foul play. As the investigation moves forward, evidence quickly points to the Marsh Girl, and she becomes the most likely culprit. Did Kya murder Chase, and what was her motive?This is my first Delia Owens, and her debut novel is stunning and profound. The descriptions of the marshes, swamps, and their wildlife are breathtaking. The author’s experience as a zoologist transpires through the vivid, colourful depiction of the wildlife surrounding Kya’s shack, and beyond. Kya is curious and methodical in her research of the marshes’ creatures. The most extraordinary creature however, she does not study or classify: Kya herself, living in a world she doesn’t desire anymore than it seems to desire her; consoled and nurtured by the marshes, which she makes her home, her comfort, her mother. This book is a fiery dance of the heart and soul with Nature, like crystalline music to the ears, a feather to the skin, deft poetry to the heart that longs for someone decent enough to fill the void left by loneliness. It is a gift of loyalty, love, and a prayer for hope. Simply put, “Where the Crawdads sing” is an exquisite, intimate, and enchanting read."
246,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2473504-jennifer,Rating 5 out of 5,"Author Delia Owens is a wildlife scientist and an award-winning nature writer. Although Where the Crawdads Sing is her debut novel in fiction, the world of writing is not foreign to her and it shows. Her experience in both nature and the written word swims through the pages of this novel and pulls the reader into a wild North Carolina marshland where isolation makes way for an entire new world. Kya Clark (aka The Marsh Girl) was left to fend for herself at a young age. She survived but not without considerable consequence. Who needs people when you have an entire ecosystem humming with life at your front door. Alone and neglected, Kya has developed into an urban legend of sorts, a ghostly rumor, a challenge for young men, and ultimately a woman of impressive strength and quiet vulnerability who has come to prefer her life in the marsh. It is her home. That is until an alleged murder points straight to her. Wide open spaces are exchanged for a jail cell, and we all know how wild things fare in a cage. Her freedom lay in the hands of a small town that has helped and harmed. What will they decide?Where the Crawdads Sing is a story about abandonment, loss, love, trust, hope, betrayal, and second chances. But ultimately, it's about the survival of the fittest. Following Kya's character was an amazing experience and I loved every second. Likewise, Mother Earth was also a living, nurturing, and incredibly palpable character in this story, and I loved her equally, if not a little more. With beautiful writing, well-organized time frames, a gorgeous setting, and lessons about life that only nature can give, Where the Crawdads Sing is a must-read. Seriously, check it out.My favorite quote:“Female fireflies draw in strange males with dishonest signals and eat them; mantis females devour their own mates. Female insects, Kya thought, know how to deal with their lovers.”"

It becomes more obvious that it’s all about timing. The right time, for the right book. Unsurprisingly I’m really glad I took a second chance on Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens.I’m pretty late to the game, so I’ll keep this short.The story, moreover the way it was written, one word – BEAUTIFUL. There is a reason why this books is so popular. Where the Crawdads Sing is a slow moving story and it is carried 100% by the characters. Even though there is a murder and a case in front of a jury, the backstory of how it came to it is what makes this book so fantastic.The author has a wonderful subtle voice. Nothing into your face, just small observations and interactions, but in the end, like a mosaic, there is this big picture, that just hits a nerve.It felt incredibly well put together. It’s hard to describe but it all worked perfectly and in harmony, the story, the plot, the characters – a true masterpiece. As I listened to the audiobook I was swept away in a nonintrusive way, quietly touched by the heart of the story, and the overall feel of it.The novel was a quieter sort. A story that slowly grew on me. It was never overwhelming, but always right there to keep me content and invested int the outcome. I still think about it. About the plot, the execution, and the author’s voice.All I can say is, I’m happy I ended up giving this book a second chance. It’s a story that deserves all the great reviews it gets. And I finally know what the hub is all about.___________________________________Find more reviews and book recommendations on my blog.Find me on Bookstagram."
248,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/133118002-javi,Rating 5 out of 5,"9/10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Esta novela tiene un desarrollo extraordinario. Y es que después de un prólogo en el que se presenta un misterio que durará hasta la última página de esta historia, ¿quién mató a Chase Andrews?, retrocedemos en el tiempo para conocer a Kya (la chica salvaje) con una prosa existencial por parte de Delia Owens. Esa prosa que analiza la condición humana, la libertad, las emociones. Una prosa que apetece leer despacio, sin prisas, a pesar del misterio a resolver.El personaje de Kya deja en un segundo plano la muerte de Chase Andrews. La vida de Kya y las circunstancias que la llevan a convertirse en la chica salvaje son el atractivo principal de la novela. Su comunión con la naturaleza, con la marisma.En la parte final se unen los dos tiempos de narración para, ahora sí, resolver el misterio sin intentos exagerados de despiste por parte de la escritora. De una manera natural, con detalles sutiles me ha hecho sospechar de varios personajes sin adivinar el final. Y que manera más original de descubrir el final.¡Recomendadísima! Una novela llena de sensibilidad y amor por la naturaleza."

The story and mystery is centered around the simple wholesomeness of Kya and her love of the marsh and all its creatures. Although the beginning was a bit slow, I was drawn in by the vivid characters. This is a story that invokes so many emotions: joy, pain, disappointment, and betrayal. It will linger with me for many days to come... I highly recommend! "

251,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9185509-melissa-mel-s-bookshelf,Rating 4 out of 5,"Before I read it, this book did not appeal to me. I don't know what exactly it was about it, the title, the cover or the marsh setting, but I wasn't interested in even looking at reviews on it. I had seen it around a quite a few times but avoided it until it was picked as the October book for the Reece Witherspoon Hello Sunshine Book Club pick. Don't get me wrong, there are some of those book club picks I haven't been too fussed about, but it brought this one to my attention. With a massive 4.53 out of 5 on goodreads with over 20000 ratings I was pretty sure it must be a decent book so I still (somewhat reluctantly) started listening to the audio version, prepared to return and exchange it if I wasn't enjoying it. Well, no return required!Kya is the ""marsh girl"". A young girl who was abandoned and left on her own in the South Carolina marshes in the 1950's. She grows up isolated, yet she is extremely intelligent - Surviving in the harsh marshlands and developing a deep bond with her natural surrounds. Flash forward to 1969, the body of a young man is found in the marshes. What did the ""marsh girl"" have to do with it, when did their paths collide?Although it didn't utterly blow me away like it seems to have done to many readers, I really did enjoy this tale. For some reason I felt a little bit of a lack of connection with the characters. I think perhaps it is because there was a lot of poetry and poetry appreciation, and unfortunately poetry and I don't really get along.But... I REALLY enjoyed it. Considering the subject matter I found it quite fast paced and entertaining, the writing was superb and even though I didn't fall in love with the characters, I still enjoyed listening to their stories.I loved the courtroom drama aspect of the book, I wasn't expecting it do go in the direction that it did and was pleasantly surprised.The romance(s) were sweet and I absolutely loved the side story of the murder and trying to figure out the twists. Unfortunately I figured out the big one, but it still gave me goosebumps!I enjoyed the ending, I just wish I had connected with Kya more.Did I enjoy the audio version?Yes I really did. I think the accent of the narrator really helped me with the setting. I'm not sure how that would have come across on paper. I enjoyed her narration of Kya and all of the men in the story, which if you have read my audio reviews before, is quite a compliment because I am not generally a fan of female narrators when they attempt a male voice.Would I recommend Where the Crawdads Sing?Yes, it was a great book. Lots of heart wrenching moments. A few twists and turns. You couldn't help feeling for Kya and admiring her strength. Really enjoyed it!I purchased the audio version of Where the Crawdads Sing at my own expense on audibleFor more reviews check out my:BlogFacebookTwitterInstagram"
252,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,Rating 4 out of 5,"8/3/19 I reread the book for a book discussion, and the story pulled me in again.How do you trust when you've been abandoned over and over again? Kya's mother left her abusive husband when Kya was only six. Then, one by one, her siblings left. When Kya was ten, her father had turned to the bottle again and walked out the door of their shack. She learned to survive by living off the land in a coastal marsh in North Carolina. Kya sold mussels to earn a little cash for food she could not forage. She was intelligent and observant, but as frightened as a deer when she encountered strangers. She learned lessons about life from observing the actions of wildlife. Two local boys were drawn to teenage Kya at various times in the book, but they disappointed her too.Chapters starting in 1952 tell the story of Kya as she goes through childhood and becomes a young adult. Alternating chapters begin in 1969, the year when the former football star, Chase Andrews, is found dead underneath a fire tower. Kya is investigated concerning his death. The two timelines converged at the trial for Chase's murder.The book is a coming-of-age story, a love story, and a murder mystery with a trial. The marsh is one of the most important characters with naturalist/author Delia Owen's gorgeous descriptions bringing it to life. I did have to suspend disbelief that Kya could manage as well as she did when she was young with so little support. Owen's writing touched me emotionally as a mother. Parts of the book were heartbreaking as I imagined how lonely the young girl must have felt, and how much she needed to be loved. While I didn't really expect the ending, it made sense with its ties into the world of nature. I would especially recommend this book to readers who enjoy exquisite nature writing, and character-based stories."

254,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4274922-bernadette,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 Stars Where the Crawdads Sing, a debut novel from Delia Owens, tells the story of Kya, nee Catherine Danielle Clark, or “Marsh Girl” as the locals have named her. Kya was born to a violent alcoholic father suffering from PTSD he incurred in WWII, and her beautiful privileged mother, who suffers at the hands of her husband. Of course dad wasn’t always this way, but once he isolates his wife in his family’s run down home, he changes into a man who drinks and abuses his wife and children. The family falls apart. Mom leaves, the older kids leave and Kya ends up living by herself in the swamplands of North Carolina. Kya’s sole source of interest and entertainment is nature and she relishes the birds, the plants, and everything around her. She is taught to read by Tate, a boy that fishes near her home. Tate puts the idea into her head to try and publish some of her drawings and writings on nature, and Kya is published. But Kya chooses to remain in the marsh, unable to adapt to the outside world . There are several lovely characters who live near the swamp, while the townspeople are judgmental and cruel except for Tate.Kya grows into a beautiful young woman and sparks the interest of an upper class former football star from town who will only cause her only more pain, loneliness and abandonment. When his mysterious death occurs in the marsh, Kya becomes embroiled in a southern courtroom drama. Delia Owens is a very talented storyteller and her gift lies in the details. Kya’s emotions are palpable. The writing is lyrical when Owens describes Kya’s relationship with nature and all of the living creatures she treasures. Many thanks to Netgalley and G.P. Putnam and Sons for the ARC in exchange for this review."
255,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/139249987-juliet-rose,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book is an easy read and didn't necessarily have any surprises or go outside of expectation. The ending was what I foresaw. What I did love was the stories of the marsh, the beings living within it. There are definitely teary parts and frustration over the lack of human compassion at times. The main character, Kya, is determined and delicate, taking life one step at a time to overcome the constant letdowns. Some parts were a bit fantastical but the relationships she develops with those who stand by her are heartwarming. For me the part that made it worth reading was Kya's connection to the natural world around her, her love for the marsh, the animals, and eventually the pure hearted humans. Her ability to find solace in isolation is beautiful and relatable. Definitely worth a read!"
256,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/172628061-flo-camus,Rating 5 out of 5,"[5.0⭐] 𝙇𝙖 𝘾𝙝𝙞𝙘𝙖 𝙎𝙖𝙡𝙫𝙖𝙟𝙚 es un thriller escrito por Delia Owens en el año 2018. Aquí se combina a la perfección la naturaleza y el misterio (hay un asesinato no resuelto). De momento, ha vendido más de tres millones de ejemplares y ha sido traducido a más de 40 idiomas.La historia se sitúa en los pantanos de Carolina del Norte, Estados Unidos, entre los años 1952 y 1970; con una sociedad machista, racista, conservadora y prejuiciosa. Nuestra protagonista, Kya, es abandonada por toda su familia; su madre, sus hermanas, su hermano Jodie y su padre (en ese orden). Por ende, ella tendrá que aprender a sobrevivir por sí sola en su marisma y lo hará, pero siempre estando rodeada de la naturaleza e intentando mantenerse lejos de los habitantes de Barkley Cove. Los rumores de estos pueblerinos le valdrán su apodo: “La Chica Salvaje”. Su vida se ve completamente arruinada cuando un hombre aparece asesinado y ella se convierte en la principal sospechosa solamente por los prejuicios que los habitantes tienen de ella.Esta novela le entrega al lector una experiencia única; sonreirá, reirá, se enternecerá, llorará, se angustiará y sufrirá. Personalmente, tengo que decir que llevaba mucho tiempo sin que un libro me produjera tantos sentimientos y emociones. Incluso, llegué a sentir cómo mi corazón bombeaba frenéticamente ante el veredicto del juicio.Es una historia realmente fuerte, cruda y dolorosa. Desde los primeros capítulos, se puede percibir la soledad de la pobre muchacha al ser abandonada por toda su familia cuando ella tenía tan solo 6 años. Lo único que la mantiene “optimista” y con fe es el hecho de que su madre y Jodie regresen a su hogar. Es desgarrador leer cómo la joven no pierde en ningún momento la esperanza y se sigue manteniendo fuerte, sin importar lo que diga el pueblo. La protagonista es digna de admirar; hay que tener muchas agallas para poder sobrevivir sola en la naturaleza y con el rechazo de todas las personas. Ella logró salir adelante sin importar nada y es por ello que cualquier lector puede quedar fascinado con la historia de esta jovencita. Además, lo que diferencia este relato de otros de este mismo estilo sería el hecho de que Kya no es tonta e ignorante; todo lo contrario, es muy inteligente y letrada (le encanta leer poesía y hasta llega a publicar libros). En más de una ocasión, uno no puede aguantar el llanto al leer el sufrimiento y el dolor de la Chica Salvaje: “Se preguntaba con languidez qué habría hecho para que todo el mundo la abandonara. Su mamá. Sus hermanas. Toda su familia. Jodie. Y ahora Tate. Sus recuerdos más desgarradores eran de las fechas desconocidas en que los miembros de su familia se fueron por el camino”. Uno no puede parar de pensar en la crueldad humana que la ha rodeado en todos sus años de vida; no ha podido vivir feliz y tranquila en ningún momento. Es más, ha tenido que luchar constantemente para poder sobrevivir ya que trabajó desde que era una niña para no morir de hambre. Fue rechazada por sus padres y sus hermanos que ni siquiera se inmutaron en saber si seguía viva o no (y, lo más importante, tampoco se la llevaron con ellos).La soledad está constantemente presente en su vida y, aunque se supone que debería estar acostumbrada a ella, la muchacha se niega a estar completamente sola: “Por fin sintió miedo. Un miedo que nacía de un lugar más profundo que el mar. Miedo por saber que volvería a estar sola. Probablemente siempre. De por vida”. Ella anhela la compañía y el tacto de otro individuo, es por eso que se niega a seguir estando sola. Al volver a ser abandonada, va mostrando su decepción hacia los seres humanos y hacia la vida, algo que deja a cualquiera con el corazón destrozado: “Me he pasado años ansiando estar con gente. Creía que de verdad alguien se quedaría conmigo, que llegaría a tener amigos y una familia. Y por fin he aprendido a enfrentarlo y protegerme”. Sin duda, esta soledad está muy bien retratada. Lo más triste es ver cómo va volviéndose cada vez más desconfiada de las personas por ilusionarla constantemente: “Tengo que vivir sola. Pero eso ya lo sabía. Hace mucho tiempo que sé que la gente no se queda”. Hay que mencionar que el dolor no es solo hacia la protagonista, uno llega a sentirse igual con Jumpin’. En esos años (1952 a 1970), se seguían tratando mal a los negros en Estados Unidos, así que el lector verá perfectamente retratada esa sociedad discriminadora y racista; en donde los pueblerinos les tiraban piedras a los negros, en donde no podían comprar en los mismos lugares que un blanco y en donde no podían sentarse ni siquiera cerca de ellos.Por suerte, el libro no son solamente tristezas ya que uno logra alegrarse con cosas tan mínimas y simples como el hecho de que Jumpin’ y su esposa, Mabel, se preocupan constantemente de la chica: le dan ropa, comida, bencina y la ayudan en todo lo que pueden. Es conmovedor saber que hay al menos una persona que realmente quiere y se preocupa por la protagonista. Además, otra alegría que se presenta sería cuando Tate le enseña a leer y deja de ser una analfabeta más del montón. Son cosas que parecen tan pequeñas para cualquier individuo, pero que en este libro significarán MUCHO porque serán los pocos momentos felices que tiene la joven. La escritora logra retratar a la perfección la sociedad estadounidense de la época y, en especial, a los pueblerinos de Carolina del Norte con todos los prejuicios que tenían. Es importante resaltar la narrativa y las descripciones de los paisajes. Cualquier persona que lea esta obra podrá transportarse perfectamente al lugar que describe porque es realmente muy detallista. Otro punto que hay que destacar sería el hecho de que la autora aprovechó sus conocimientos (ya que es zoóloga) para poder crear la atmósfera, la historia y a los personajes. Hay constantes referencias a la flora y a la fauna nativa del lugar, sumados a datos biológicos generales. Es una idea brillante porque Owens deja un poco de su esencia en este libro al combinar sus dotes literarios con su profesión. Además, es realmente original el que haya incluido materiales “dinámicos” en la novela. Al inicio, hay un mapa con los lugares que Kya suele frecuentar para que los lectores puedan ubicarse. También, hay constantes poemas que la muchacha suele recitar y que están perfectamente vinculados con su vida y con su historia. Sin duda, es una genialidad el emplear todos los elementos posibles para la construcción de este thriller.Finalmente, puedo decir que recomiendo encarecidamente su lectura para cualquiera que pueda resistir una historia cruda, fuerte y trágica. En mi caso, lloré de principio hasta el final; no hubo ningún momento en el que me sintiera plenamente feliz por la protagonista porque siempre sentí lástima y pena por su situación. Es un libro que te hará sentir MUCHO y que te transportará completamente a la época."
257,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15546696-nilton-teixeira,Rating 3 out of 5,"I rated it 3.5 stars.What a sweet fairytale!Not a bad debut. I was engaged from the beginning and I did not want to stop.I enjoyed the story line (although not very believable) and the structure. During the first 25% I had a problem with the writing style and with the excessive use of dialect (which slowed down my reading). Also, the author seems to have an obsession about food and was very repetitive about it. The book is very descriptive of the natural world and everything else, but the language used didn’t feel that natural.I noticed that after 45 or 50% the pace changed and even the writing became lighter and the author reduced the use of dialects.There is a bit of poetry, of which I have never been fond of, that some readers may enjoy.Then there is romance (I don’t read romance), which made me think that I was now reading a book directed to YA.Then there is a courtroom drama, which I enjoyed (there were some great moments of defense) but it was too short.Anyways, the characters were interesting and the story line was good enough to engage me.Not the best book I have read, but it is quite enjoyable if you read it as a fairytale or don’t question the level of believability and accept it as a fiction.By the way, I loved the ending. I thought it was perfect."
258,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37596075-holly,Rating 5 out of 5,"Sometimes you finish a book and while feeling good because you really enjoyed it, you also feel sad because you have to say goodbye to the people you’ve come to love. That is how I feel about Where the Crawdads Sing. To say that this debut novel from Delia Owens is a magnificent and delightful read is an understatement. Delia Owens has an eye for detail and her expertise and appreciation for nature shines through. This is an amazing novel with lyrical writing and expertly developed characters. As an example of Owen’s skill, these quotes illustrate her gift for stringing together words in a mesmerizing way as she establishes the setting:Marsh is not swamp. Marsh is a space of light, where grass grows in water, and water flows into the sky. The marsh was guarded by a torn shoreline, labeled by early explorers as the “Graveyard of the Atlantic” because riptides, furious winds, and shallow shoals wrecked ships like paper hats along what would become the North Carolina coast.Those looking for serious land moved on, and this infamous marsh became a net, scooping up a mishmash of mutinous sailors, castaways, debtors, and fugitives dodging wars, taxes, or laws that they didn’t take to.At first I wasn’t so sure about this book...girl lives in Marsh? Feral? But it surpassed my highest standards and moved me to such an extent like few books do. The story revolves around Kya, whose entire life we follow, beginning at 6 years old. In the opening pages, we see Kya’s Mother leave the house and walk away. I felt emotionally attached to Kya at this early point in the story, while she waits to see her Mother wave but she never does and Kya begins to wonder if she will ever return.  It is a tale of survival, courage, love, and a search for self. It is virtually impossible not to feel compassion for Kya as we bear witness to her life. We feel along with her, running the emotional gamut from anger to joy, with stops along the way at despair, loneliness and contentment to name just a few. We root for her, cry with her and celebrate with her. Where the Crawdads Sing is ultimately about independence, courage and the will to survive. The book explores themes of trust/betrayal and love/hate plus a murder mystery is added in to the mix. I cherished the reading of this book and it’s unfolding story. As trite as it sounds, I must confess that I did not want it to end. Also, I found myself thinking about the book when I wasn’t reading it and, not just after finishing it like other books, but throughout reading it. I cannot recommend this book highly enough — for the characters, the story and the writing."
259,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25667717-doug,Rating 2 out of 5,"2.5, rounded down.Prior to this debut novel, Owens published three works of nature writing - and it shows, since the descriptions of the North Carolina marshlands are perhaps the strongest element in this book too. The other strong point is the central character of Kya, a rather unique creation (although the early chapters of her as a child reminded me of that dreadful movie 'Beasts of the Southern Wild', aka 'That Movie With the Precocious Kid With the Made-up Name No One Can Pronounce or Spell'). What DOESN'T really work is the excruciatingly bad, clunky dialogue, and the mundane love story/ies, and while the murder mystery does keep one guessing until the final page, the conclusion is also somewhat unsatisfying. The courtroom scenes are effective, but tend to go on longer than their sell-by date. And I found the whole cornpone 'aw shucks' quality of the story a bit off-putting. Still, a noble effort, and will probably make a decent film when the inevitable adaptation happens."

Where the Crawdads Sing cannot be easily categorized into a single genre. It is a coming of age story, a passionate love story and a totally envolving mystery. The character development was slow, methodical and timed perfectly. The story engages the reader and will not let you go. If you start reading at night, forget about going to bed, if you are listening while walking bring extra water as you simply won't want to put this one down. The story has been summarized for many reviewers but reminded me a little of the 1994 movie ""Nell"". This movie featured a young girl living in an isolated cabin, cut off from the modern world. I cannot wait to tell all my book club friends about this very special book!"

262,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56111743-roman-clodia,Rating 1 out of 5,"Packed full of nature writing if that's your thing, but a story which I found frankly sentimental, full of cliches, melodramatic and just oh so predictable. I found it difficult to buy into this romanticized vision of the 'wild child of nature', and long descriptions of marshland flora and fauna, while 'poetic', felt stranded aimlessly without a story to fill the foreground. For me, this was unreadable - sorry!"

The marshes, lagoons, flora and fauna are vividly described although somewhat glorified. Where are the mosquitoes and snakes?Maybe I just suffer from ophidiophobia but you wouldn't catch me walking barefoot through the N.C. marshes!Kya is, for the most part, believable. Her knowledge of nature and her detailed accounting as well as her ability to paint what she sees is all plausible. I could understand her shyness and fear of people and relationships. I did think some of her thoughts and words were in contrast to her lack of communication. Who taught her how to swear?I think I would have liked the book better without the inclusion of Chase. Owens does creditably weave that relationship into the story. I felt the ending was satisfying and the last part of the book changed my rating from 3+ stars to 4 stars. It was definitely different and an enjoyable read."

265,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5898724-chris-lee,Rating 5 out of 5,"""Where The Crawdads Sing"" begins with a deep jolt straight to the heart. A disgruntled family living near a marsh abandons each other, leaving only a father and his young daughter in a dilapidated cabin. The father chases his vices as the young one marvels at the joy of the outdoors and the wonderment of discovering birds and insects. When the father ups and leaves, Kya is left to fend for herself. As the days pass, she meets a boy who teaches her how to read and encourages her to follow her interest in researching the critters that inhabit the marsh. Everything seems to be going great until someone dies and an investigation starts to unravel secrets in the small town. 
“Time ensures children never know their parents young.”
I enjoyed the book quite a bit. It actually conjured up memories of my own upbringing. In a way, I understood what the main character was going through. Barkley Cove encapsulates everything about the harshness of a small town, right down to the proclivity to mistreat those who are outcasts. It’s not all doom and gloom, though. Kya takes solace in those who are kind and understand her predicament, uses her knowledge of the area to help sustain her way of life, and ultimately unlocks the joy of learning to read. 
“If anyone would understand loneliness, the moon would.”
There is quite a bit of pain, loneliness, and fear that surround Kya as she grows older and learns more about the world. Her research grounds her, but she still yearns for someone to share her life with. Something I think we can all relate to. 
“Please don't talk to me about isolation. No one has to tell me how it changes a person. I have lived it. I am isolation.""
I’ll say nothing more about the story, but I would like to talk a bit about the writing. Sure, it might meander a bit and gloss over pertinent character details, but what it does well is tell a great coming-of-age story. It covers most of the physical and biological touchstones in a primitive setting while providing vivid descriptions of the natural world. The way the story ends is a keen fascination: We can guess where it might end up, but it takes guts to actually go through with it. Justification might be the way sinners are granted absolution, but in this fictional world, without spoiling anything, I think vindication reigns supreme.❖ Category: literary fiction / mystery❖ Rating: 4.5/5"
266,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101670021-patricija-book-duo,Rating 3 out of 5,"3/5Tikrai neplanavau šios knygos skaityti. Iki kol kine neparodė ekranizacijos treilerio. Galvoju pala, tai dėl šito čia pasaulis nuprotėjo? Nu gi turi būti kažkas daugiau. Bet šiaip gi neprivalo. Kartas nuo karto turi iššauti knyga, kurią gali skaityti turbūt beveik kiekvienas, kurią galėtum ir močiutei, ir vadovei, ir mokinei padovanoti, kuri neturi kuo sunervinti ar supykdyti ir tiktų net tam, kuris paskutinį kartą knygą rankose laikė prieš dešimtmetį. Nes tinkamas dedamąsias turi – pakankamai graži, pakankamai jautri, pakankamai nuspėjama. Man ji nepasirodė tvirtai ant žemės stovinti nei kaip detektyvas, nei kaip meilės istorija, nei veikėjais paremtas romanas, bet ir lūkesčio kažkokio didelio nesukėlė – jau po pirmų trijų skyrių buvo aišku kas nutiks su kiekvienu iš veikėjų. Kiekvienu.Negaliu sakyti, kad pagrindinė veikėja nervino, bet tiesiog labai labai jautėsi, kad autorė parašė pirmąjį savo romaną. Man čia viskas priminė kokį „Namelį prerijose“ ar klasės auklėtojos cituojamas Ezopo pasakėčias – problema, sprendimas, pamoka – visi patenkinti. Skaitėsi kaip YA ne blogąja prasme, tiesiog kėlė švelnią šypseną tas pagrindinės veikėjos neišpasakytas nuostabumas ir gebėjimas sužavėti visus, kurie jai duoda nors menkiausį šansą. Neįtikino manęs jos mokslinė ir meninė kelionė, o tų visų teigiamų, gerbtinų ir žavių bruožų rodėsi stipriai padauginta – normalu, kai autoriai labai pamilsta savo veikėjus, bet jie tada ir gaunasi tokie truputį pasakėčių herojai, o ne tikri žmonės – visi turintys paskirtą vaidmenį ir turintys išpildyti kokį nors lūkestį – ar tai pamoką pakurstyti, ar kažką pademonstruoti. Bet jei atvirai, manęs čia ir gamtos grožis kažkaip baisingai neužliūliavo (na, pvz „Bičių dūzgesys“ tekstas, rodos, net sunkėsi iš puslapių medumi), ir pati istorija nesukėlė emocijos. Suprantu, kodėl daug kam patiko ir gerai, kad patiko – pamoka iš knygos graži ir reikalinga. O aš smalsumą patenkinau. Tiek ir tenorėjau. "

My only issue is that I really found it hard to believe that she could survive on her own from age 10, with minimal outside help.It is a wonderful story of connecting with nature and also with people. It is a story about accepting the differences in others. It really is a great book- easy to fall into and a book you don't want to put down.4 Stars because I did have to suspend some disbelief."
268,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12889617-anne-finds-joy,Rating 5 out of 5,"All the stars! This is sure to be one of my top reads of 2018! An achingly beautiful and tender story, where the nature-filled coastal marshes of N. Carolina are fully alive and integral to the story. It's a story of small coastal town life and an abandoned child who becomes one with the wilderness she lives in. It's a story of her struggle for acceptance from a town that doesn't understand her, and the complexities of love with the one who knows her the deepest. It's a story that blends coming of age, mystery, courtroom drama, and a love story. And at its heart it's a tribute to the juxtaposition of light and dark spaces both in the landscape around us and within the human soul.Audio notes: 5* for the narration by Cassandra Campbell. Her voice is calm, gentle, and soothing, which fits with the setting and mood of the story. Her southern accents are subtle yet authentic, and she delivered distinct voices for each of the varied characters that represented them really well. The story really came alive with the listening! Highly recommended!"

271,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57354360-sarah,Rating 2 out of 5,"It seems fitting that the last book I read in 2020 was just as disappointing as the year itself.Perhaps that is a bit of an exaggeration, but considering this book is one of the most highly rated books I have read, seemingly loved universally and given many a prestigious award- I was expecting to love it. Subsequently feeling pretty mediocre-low about it, I obviously felt a bit let down. I think that with over a million ratings on goodreads, there isn't much point giving a fully synopsis in my review. However, in just a few words this is what Where the Crawdads Sing is about: grits, murder, romance and prejudice. I should have loved this. It was a combination of so many things I usually adore in literature- survivalist themes, courtroom scenes and a romantic undercurrent. But even they couldn't make me engaged. Instead, I was bored for a good portion. Something I have seen touched on in a few reviews is the use of local dialect. I am not from North Carolina, nor the US at all, so I feel that I can't personally comment on it but if you are interested in hearing more I would suggest reading this review. Apart from being unrealistic, I just didn't jive with the dialogue. It is one of my pet peeves when authors spell out the dialogue phonetically to show to the readers that they have an accent. But as well as this, only certain characters were given this treatment. And coincidently, they were all the characters we were meant to dislike. The others spoke in so called 'proper' English, despite giving the story inconsistencies. I didn't like the implication there that having an accent or speaking in any other way than ye old 'proper' American indicates a level of stupidity or maliciousness. Perhaps I am looking too deep into this, but it really bothered me. Something that reviewers who love this book often talk about is how beautiful it was. Perhaps this is another instance of cultural disconnect here, but I could not fathom how the swamps and marshes and mud were beautiful. There were a few pretty lines here and there, but I wasn't a fan of the overall aesthetic of the novel. I am aware that this is entirely subjective critique but just wanted to throw it in. “I wasn't aware that words could hold so much. I didn't know a sentence could be so full.” I was really hoping that the saving grace of this book would be the resolution of the mystery. I enjoyed the courtroom scenes and investigative processes so had hope- but was once again let down by the ending. I wasn't shocked by the ending as I think was intended, but more disappointed that it was left to the end for shock value. (this is going to be purposefully vague) I would have preferred to know the truth and as a result see further into the character's mind during the trial scenes. I think it could have been so much better that way and shown how much more layered that character is than it at first seems. I felt pretty lukewarm about the romance, but the sex scenes were very awkward to read. There were perhaps 3 characters who I actually liked, and the rest of them I could take or leave. I am a character driven reader, so that really hurt my enjoyment of the story. That being said, the plot also left something to be desired for me, as did the writing. Now that I have reached the end of my review, I think I will revise my rating. I originally had this at a 3 star because I appreciated some aspects (and was admittedly scared of rating this low after looking at the abundant 4 and 5 star reviews of my friends). But I think a two star better encapsulates my feelings. Just to be clear- if you loved this book I am so so happy for you! I know I am in the minority, and I might be missing something, or not understanding some masterful literary device that made everyone else love it.

Η Κάια μεγαλώνει μόνη σαν το μανιτάρι στο βάλτο όταν όλοι οι δικοί της αρχίζουν να φεύγουν ένας ένας.Είναι 6 χρονών.Ζει με χυλό και μύδια σε μια καλύβα χωρίς τρεχούμενο νερό και ηλεκτρικό.Έχει πάει μια μέρα σχολείο.Μέχρι τα 14 δεν ξέρει να διαβάζει.Δεν αρρωσταίνει ποτέ.Πατάει σκουριασμένο καρφί και δεν παθαίνει τίποτα.Δεν κινδυνεύει ποτέ απο άγρια ζώα.Αλιγάτορες δεν έχει εκεί;Μόνο γλάρους;Αν και μεγαλώνει υποσιτισμένη κι άπλυτη γίνεται γυναικάρα με φοβερό σώμα και υπέροχα γυαλιστερά μαλλιά.Μαθαίνει να διαβάζει στα 14 απο ένα αγόρι που ενδιαφέρεται γι'αυτήν και της φέρνει διάφορα βιβλία.Καταλήγει να διαβάζει και να κατανοεί τον Αϊνστάιν.Μαζεύει φτερά και πούπουλα και τα ζωγραφίζει.Καταλήγει να εκδίδει μια σειρά βιβλίων φυσιοδιφικού περιεχομένου με δικές της εικονογραφήσεις και σχόλια ,τα οποία γίνονται ανάρπαστα και βγάζει ένα σωρό λεφτά.Επίσης γίνεται και διάσημη ποιήτρια με ποιήματά της δημοσιευμένα σε ένα σωρό περιοδικά αλλά χρησιμοποιεί ψευδώνυμο.Ας με λυπηθεί κάποιος επιτέλους!Στο ένα τριτο του βιβλίου βλέπουμε ένα κοριτσάκι να μαζεύει μύδια.Βαρετό.Μετά παρακολουθούμε το ρομάντζο της με δυο ωραίους νέους,τον καλό και τον κακό.Οι νεαροί σκέφτονται τους απαλούς και σφιχτούς μηρούς της και στριφογυρνάνε στα κρεβάτια τους.Διαβάζουμε οτι ""το υπογάστριό της έσφυζε λες και όλο της το αίμα είχε μαζευτεί εκεί"" μόλις ο καλός νέος έβγαλε το σορτς του και ""κοιτώντας τη βαθιά στα μάτια,κόλλησε τη στύση του επάνω της"".Απαπα ,hot!Ανάψαμε πάλι.Αλλά ο καλός νέος ήταν πολύ καλός και δεν ήθελε να εκθέσει το κορίτσι,έτσι πήγε χαμένη η στύση.Τελικά κάνει σεξ με το κακό αγόρι που της έταξε γάμο ,αλλά μάπα το καρπούζι.Το κακό αγόρι ήταν κακό σε όλα.Το βιβλίο ξεκινάει με το κακό αγόρι να βρίσκεται νεκρό στον βάλτο λίγα χρόνια αφού ξεπαρθένεψε την Κάια,την παράτησε και παντρευτηκε μια άλλη.Υπάρχουν κάποια εμβόλιμα κεφάλαια που ασχολούνται με την έρευνα για τον θάνατό του και καταλήγουμε να συλληφθεί η Κάια παρόλο που έχει αλλοθι οτι ήταν σε άλλη πόλη όταν έγινε το κακό.Δεν έχω λόγια να περιγράψω πόσο χάλια ήταν όλο αυτό το κομμάτι,πόσο βαρετή η δίκη( το χειρότερο κομμάτι του βιβλίου,άθλιο),πόσο ψεύτικο όλο το σκηνικό και πόσο προβλέψιμη η αποκάλυψη που έγινε χρόνια μετά την αθώωση της οτι τελικά αυτή είχε σκοτώσει το κακό αγόρι με ένα σχέδιο που μόνο γέλια μπορεί να προκαλέσει.Anyway...Όλα αυτά μπορεί και να μην με ενοχλούσαν και να το διάβαζα πιο ευχάριστα αν δεν ήταν τόσο αργόσυρτο και βαρετό,αν οι χαρακτήρες δεν ήταν τόσο ψευτικοι και στερεοτυπικοί,αν δεν προσπαθούσε να πουλήσει μελόδραμα,αν μπορούσε να πουλήσει την εξέλιξη της Κάια με μια στοιχειώδη αληθοφάνεια,αν...αν...αν...Ουφ ,βαρεθηκα,φτάνει,δεν θέλω να πω κάτι αλλο.

Last year several of my friends read this book and wrote glowing reviews giving it 4 and 5 stars, which prompted me to request it at the local library.

Imagine!!!Delia Owens is to be praised for her knowledge of nature, her wonderful imagination, her superior writing skills and her excellent choice of words!! These quotes were on the cover of the book and I need to share them with you. -""With prose luminous as a low-country Moon, Owens weaves a compelling tale of a forgotten girl in the unforgiving coastal marshes of North Carolina. It is a murder mystery/love story/courtroom drama that readers will love, but the novel delves so much deeper into the bone and sinew of our very nature, asking often unanswerable questions, old and intractable as the marsh itself. A stunning debut!""-Christopher Scotton, author of The Secret Wisdom of the Earth"" A lush debut; Owens delivers her mystery wrapped in gorgeous, lyrical prose.""-AlexandraFuller, author of Don't Let's Go to the Dogs TonightI learned a lot about nature by reading this novel, which was a bonus because the storyline and the characters are so compelling and real! I loved Kya, ""the Marsh Girl"" and had a special place in my heart for Jumpin' and Mabel and Tate. Even the courthouse cat, Sunday Justice warmed my soul. There are several surprising twists, but rather than detract, they enhance and belong in this story.

And while the plots have nothing in common, this lacks the depth, theme and unique characters I'd expected given its high ratings. The predictable romantic tale of the Marsh Girl fell flat from the very beginning and I was tempted to toss it in the DNF pile. And while I enjoy Southern based stories, Greg Iles books in particular, I found little if any evidence of what would normally be found in the genre. And while well paced, its unoriginal, predictable and a bit boring. As in all art, 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder'. Enough said."

The murder mystery was easy to figure out with the clues given making the final section a bit sluggish but was very satisfying nonetheless.

279,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6868207-mau-maponto-lee,Rating 4 out of 5,"La imagen de las marismas y los pantanos está siempre presente en “La Chica Salvaje”, vinculando la formación científica de la autora Delia Owens con su genio literario. Kya vive en la marisma. Se siente cómoda y confiada en su pequeña choza con su familia de gaviotas. Puede sobrevivir con una interacción humana mínima y sabe el nombre de cada caparazón y pluma de ave que recolecta. Este amor por la naturaleza es evidente para los lectores a través de la tierna forma en que Kya interactúa con su entorno: pintando su colección, susurrando en la hierba y alimentando a las aves todos los días. Ella entiende a la marisma como ningún otro, y esto saca a la luz el vasto conocimiento de la autora, quien es zoologista y conservacionista. Owens entreteje brillantemente la historia de Kya con una historia sobre la vida silvestre de Carolina del Norte. La poesía y la metáfora esparcidas por todo el libro nos obligan como lectores a aprender más sobre el área sin darnos cuenta de que lo estamos haciendo.Cuando leemos esta historia, nos adentramos en ese pantano y nos comprometemos en un viaje a través de los prejuicios del sur de los Estados Unidos en la década de 1960. Vemos a Kya luchar contra acosadores de todas las edades y nos damos cuenta de que, aunque ha demostrado su valía, los acosadores aún se niegan a dejarla en paz. Nos vemos obligados a mirar la historia y a nosotros mismos, y a cuestionar las decisiones que podemos dar por sentadas.A primera vista, “La Chica Salvaje” es solo otra historia sobre llegar a la mayoría de edad con indicios de un misterio de asesinato. Pero en realidad, es un estudio de la intimidad. Kya nunca entiende el amor. Ella ve a su madre amorosa, padre abusivo y cinco hermanos caminar fuera de su vida para siempre. Una pareja de habitantes de la zona la ayudan lo mejor que pueden: tomando donaciones de su iglesia para vestirla, aconsejándola sobre la anatomía femenina para cuando sea mayor de edad y contratándola para trabajos que no necesitan. Sin embargo, su ayuda es limitada. Como afroamericanos, están relegados al ""pueblo de color"" fuera de los límites de la ciudad y enfrentan prejuicios similares a los de Kya.La relación más positiva viene en la forma de Tate Walker, un amigo de la infancia. A medida que Kya y Tate se vuelven más cercanos a lo largo de los años, ella comienza a reflexionar sobre el amor, o la ausencia de este, en el reino animal: Kya observa a las luciérnagas y nota que las hembras consiguen lo que quieren (primero una pareja, luego una comida) simplemente cambiando sus señales. Kya se da cuenta de que en el juego de la vida animal no hay maldad involucrada, solo la vida que late, incluso a expensas de algunos de los jugadores. Cuando Tate toma una mala decisión, Kya está aún más convencida de que el amor es solo un instinto reproductivo: aparearse y seguir adelante. Se necesitará el amor de un pueblo, no solo de un hombre, para reparar su corazón fracturado.Hay una calidad lenta, casi inquietante en este libro. Dado que Kya pasa sola la mayor parte de su infancia y adultez temprana, Owens captura ese aislamiento en la escritura, centrándose intensamente en el entorno que rodea a Kya, ya que durante gran parte de su vida eso es todo lo que tiene. Nuestra conexión con Kya crece con el tiempo y, a medida que avanza la novela, nos sentimos más protectores con esta niña (y luego con esta joven) que ha sido tratada tan mal a lo largo de su vida. Abandonada una y otra vez, Kya aprende a cuidarse sola y a no depender de nadie. Y al igual que el propio pantano, esta novela está llena de secretos. A medida que Kya crece y vive su vida, se revelan muchos secretos diferentes, tanto para ella como sobre ella, algunos mucho más traumáticos que otros. La idea de que nadie es digno de confianza es algo con lo que Kya decide vivir a medida que crece. La marisma es su única constante, ese entorno lleno de vida y belleza. Sentimos que el pantano se convierte en una metáfora de la propia Kya: hermosa y pura, pero incomprendida y pasada por alto por la gente del pueblo. La gente del area cree que conoce tanto a Kya como a la marisma, pero en realidad no entienden a ninguna de las dos. Pero el misterio del asesinato en “La Chica Salvaje” no es la verdadera trama, lo cual es una diferencia refrescante de la mayoría de los libros de éste género. De hecho, si como lectores tratáramos de identificar la trama solo por sus eventos, nos quedaríamos cortos. Esta historia es a veces dolorosamente lenta. Hay poca o ninguna acción. Los saltos de tiempo están señalados solo por un año impreso al comienzo de cada capítulo, lo que puede resultar confuso ya que toda la historia (el pasado y el presente de Kya) se desarrolla en el pasado del lector. Sin embargo, esta historia no trata sobre un asesinato o el paso del tiempo; se trata de “la chica de la marisma”.Si bien la historia puede avanzar lentamente, las vidas de los personajes son ricas y desarrolladas, llenas de amor y errores. Algunos de los personajes principales toman malas decisiones cuando se enfrentan a probabilidades casi imposibles, y como lectores nos preguntamos qué haríamos en tal situación. Siendo la primera novela de Delia Owens, y tratando a fondo una historia sobre llegar a la madurez, es perfecta para cualquiera que quiera sumergirse por completo en la vida de otro, para bien o para mal.

Al principio pensé, bueno es un poco lento, pero qué bien escrito está, qué descripciones tan bellas y poco a poco me fui introduciendo en la marisma como una gaviota más viendo a Kia desde la orilla.Es un libro de que nos habla de resiliencia, de cómo el ser humano es capaz de sobreponerse a cualquier evento que ocurra, esa capacidad que tenemos de reinventarnos y resurgir de nuestras cenizas. De pertenencia, esa necesidad básica con la que nacemos y es la que nos hace sobrevivir los primeros años, esa necesidad que nos persigue toda nuestra vida sin que seamos conscientes de ello. Todos necesitamos pertenecer, sentir que formamos parte de algo, sentirnos queridos y valorados. Habla de prejuicios, de esos que todos tenemos en algún momento inculcados no sabemos muy bien como, esos que nos hacen seguir la corriente de esa pertenencia. Quizás si pienso diferente dejo de pertenecer…Habla también de bondad, a veces encubierta a veces visible. Habla de desesperación, una madre que se va… qué tiene que haber pasado una madre para dejar a sus pequeños, para dar de lado uno de los instintos más básicos que tiene una madre que es proteger a su progenie. Habla de tantas cosas…. Que me ha enamorado.El libro tiene dos partes bien diferenciadas pero que en el libro se van entrelazando, en la primera nos encontramos a Kia desde niña hasta su entrada en la adultez, de como va superando los obstáculos que le pone la vida y cómo va envolviéndose en la marisma, en su naturaleza, en su olor salobre y sus destellos provocados por el sol reflejado en las conchas. En la segunda nos encontramos ante una investigación por asesinato de un chico del pueblo y como Kia se ve implicada en ella. No penséis que es un thriller, esta investigación realmente sirve para explicar otras cosas y poner de relieve algunas otras.La historia de Kia es cruda y tierna a la vez, espeluznante y bonita. Un libro lleno de paradojas. Sin duda recomiendo su lectura."

""I wasn't aware that words could hold so much. I didn't know a sentence could be so full.""
I feel this strange urge to say that this book is about.... nothing. Nothing special, that is. The storyline is so simplistic, yet I think it was so utterly captivating. The writing style is beautiful and picturesque, with a narrative that's easy to follow and one you will find yourself immersed in without even noticing. I was hooked after the first few pages. Then, from start to finish I just wanted to know what will happen, or not happen, next - since there's not much going on. Am I making sense here? 😂 This books is filled with so much emotion. It's heartbreaking, heartwarming, moving, tragic and uplifting, all at the same time. Kya, the main character, is trying to survive by herself. She has been abandoned by her mother at a young age, then by her siblings. She has to fend for herself, while occasionally dealing with a stone cold, mean father. She's known as ""the Marsh girl"" and has a bad reputation in town without an actual reason - just because she lives in the marshes, people see her as a dirty good-for-nothing girl. But as she grows up, mostly by herself, two men come into her life (at different points of time) and teach her about the good and bad in life.I fell in love with Kya, with her strength and her simple goodness. This is a character you won't forget about any time soon. Highly recommend!"

""Within all the words of biology, she searched for an explanation of why a mother would leave her offspring.""
My heart went out to Kya from the very early pages, the moment when her mum walks out on her when she is just 6 years old. Living in a marshy wilderness alone, Kya is feeling lonely and abandoned, as people in the town turn their backs on her, making her feel unwelcome. Kya only has nature to nurture and protect her when no one else would and the wild creatures of the marsh as her friends. The chapters of Kya's story starting in 1952 are intertwined with murder investigation chapters set in 1969 until the two timelines collide. For one reason or another, Kya becomes the prime suspect in the murder case as she has history with the 'dead' local golden boy and a couple of witnesses can place her near the crime scene. But how can the Marsh Girl get a fair trial with the jury full of prejudiced villagers who rejected and ignored her for years?The vivid depiction of the marsh surroundings, the heartbreaking story of Kya's survival, the suspense of the murder trial and especially Delia Owen's beautiful prose completely sucked me in and made the reading of the novel such a memorable experience. I loved this book and cannot recommend it enough.Many thanks to NetGalley and Little, Brown Book UK for my ARC in exchange for an honest review."

As much as I want to give this story a full five stars for the prose and compelling characters that tug at your heart, I just can’t. Here’s why. . .**spoiler alert**To be blunt, Kya got away with murder. She never felt one smidgeon of remorse for taking a human life. It was all cold biology to her. I understand her mental state and that her childhood lead her to such an action, but that still doesn’t make her act of murder okay.Before you go getting out your pitchforks, hear me out. I agree it felt good for Chase to get murdered. The guy was a selfish, womanizing jerk who didn’t deserve to walk this earth, but that doesn’t mean two wrongs make a right. The end of him did not justify the means. Kya is not God—who is the only rightful giver and taker of life. I am a little concerned that I am in the minority with this opinion. Taking justice into our own hands is no small thing. I cannot condone a book that celebrates such an action no matter how good the writing is."
287,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"I'm all alone in the world. That's the way protagonist Kya lives her semi-feral life in Carolina marsh land, and that's me too, alone in my opinion of this novel. For lack of a better word, it's schlock, a novel that had promise in the beginning but quickly devolved into Harlequin romance/Southern murder mystery territory, complete with an unbelievable plot, unnecessary explanations of the characters' thoughts and actions, poetry to explain Kya's feelings, and lists of all the food eaten by law enforcement as they investigate a crime. Tight editing (really, any editing) could have made this a modestly mediocre tale, but left on its own it's terrible. "

Lớn lên trong một gia đình với người cha rượu chè và bạo lực, Kya đã sớm nếm trải mùi vị của chia ly và cảm giác bị bỏ rơi, khi lần lượt các anh chị em của cô và đến cả mẹ của Kya cũng rời bỏ gia đình vì không thể chịu đựng nổi cảnh sống nghèo khó nơi chốn đồng lầy hoang vu và những trận đánh đập không thương tiếc. Từ năm 7 tuổi, Kya đã phải học cách tự sinh tồn và lớn lên giữa cảnh sống hoang dã của thiên nhiên và cái nhìn đầy tính phán xét của người dân quanh vùng. Ở những chương đầu tiên của câu chuyện, tôi đã không khỏi xót xa và đau lòng cho Kya, cho một cô bé ở độ tuổi lẽ ra phải được cha mẹ yêu thương, nuôi nấng, bảo bọc, thì giờ đây lại phải tự mình xoay xở định hướng cho cuộc đời. May mắn được ông trời ban cho sự thông minh và nhạy cảm, Kya đã hoàn toàn chỉ dựa vào bản thân mình và những khả năng cô có được một cách tự nhiên để sống sót và trưởng thành giữa thế giới của mẹ Tự nhiên tràn đầy hiểm nguy nhưng cũng ẩn chứa rất nhiều điều để khám phá. Rồi khi đến độ tuổi chớm yêu, Kya dần nhận ra tình bạn mà cô đã có với Tate - chàng trai đánh cá tóc vàng mà cô bé Kya bắt gặp khi còn bé - bỗng chốc trở thành một thứ tình cảm gì đó khác hơn chỉ là tình bạn đơn thuần. Từ một cô thiếu nữ vốn luôn quen với sự cô đơn và bị bỏ rơi, Kya nhận ra mình đã yêu Tate - kiểu tình yêu ngọt ngào, tinh khôi pha lẫn sự hoang dại, mới mẻ như chính bản chất con người cô - cô gái lớn lên nơi vùng đồng lầy Bắc Carolina:
“Rồi khi con bé xoay người lại, nó đâm vào Tate mới đứng lên, và cả hai đông cứng, nhìn chăm chăm vào đôi mắt của nhau. Cả hai thôi cười. Cậu nắm lấy vai con bé, ngập ngừng một giây, rồi hôn lên môi Kya khi những chiếc lá lả tả rơi và nhảy múa quanh đôi bạn trẻ.Con bé không biết gì về hôn nên giữ đầu và môi cứng đờ. Họ tách ra và sững nhìn nhau, tự hỏi cái vừa rồi từ đâu ra và làm gì tiếp nữa. Cậu nhẹ nhàng nhặt một chiếc lá từ tóc con bé và thả nó rơi xuống đất. Tim con bé đập loạn. Trong tất cả những tình yêu nó biết từ gia đình thất thường của nó, không cái nào cho cảm giác thế này.”
Tate yêu thương và trân trọng Kya đúng với con người thật của cô, đồng thời cũng nhìn ra tiềm năng nơi Kya và ủng hộ cô phát triển tiềm năng trở thành nhà sinh vật học đồng lầy. Thế nhưng khi Tate quyết định ra đi để học đại học, sau đó sai lầm nghĩ rằng một cô gái vốn lớn lên giữa chốn thiên nhiên như Kya không thể hòa nhập được với xã hội hàn lâm nơi trường đại học của cậu, Tate - như chính gia đình ruột thịt của Kya ngày trước - đã khơi lại nỗi đau và nỗi ám ảnh về việc bị bỏ rơi nơi Kya. Cô gái ấy đã thử một lần chọn tình yêu, để rồi thấy lựa chọn ấy của mình lại đẩy mình trở về với nỗi cô đơn, với cảm giác đớn đau không gì tả nổi khi một lần nữa, Kya lại không phải là lựa chọn của người mà cô đã dâng trọn tình yêu: 
“Thế nhưng khi bộ sưu tập của cô lớn lên, nỗi cô đơn trong cô cũng vậy. Một nỗi đau lớn bằng cả trái tim sống trong lồng ngực cô gái. Không có gì có thể xoa dịu nó. Không phải lũ mòng biển, một hoàng hôn tráng lệ, hay chiếc vỏ sò quý hiếm nhất.Tháng tiếp tháng biến thành một năm.Nỗi cô đơn lớn hơn mức cô có thể giữ trong mình. Cô ước mong giọng nói, sự hiện diện, cái đụng chạm của một người nào đó, nhưng ước mong hơn cả là bảo vệ trái tim cô.Tháng tháng trôi sang năm tiếp theo. Và sang năm sau nữa.”
Rồi Chase Andrews xuất hiện. Chase - chàng trai sáng giá, ngôi sao bóng bầu dục của thị trấn, người luôn không thiếu các cô gái theo đuổi, nhưng có vẻ như cậu ta chỉ muốn theo đuổi Kya. Chase tiếp cận Kya với sự ngọt ngào và lịch thiệp, đúng kiểu của một con đực đang muốn thu hút và lấy lòng con cái:
“Nhìn qua vai, cô gật đầu với cậu. Cậu bước xuống thuyền và chìa tay về phía cô - những ngón tay dài rám nắng, lòng bàn tay mở. Cô ngập ngừng: chạm vào người khác nghĩa là cho đi một phần của bản thân, một mảnh cô không bao giờ lấy lại được.”
Kya dường như đã cảm giác được Chase đến với cô không phải bằng sự chân thành. Nhưng đó là thời điểm trái tim non trẻ và thơ ngây của cô vẫn chưa hết nhức nhối và đớn đau sau khi bị Tate bỏ rơi, và tâm hồn Kya thì đã quá khổ sở với nỗi cô đơn đã luôn đeo bám cô kể từ ngày mẹ cô bỏ đi trong thinh lặng. Và Kya quyết định chấp nhận sự ve vãn của Chase, trở thành bạn gái của kẻ lăng nhăng có tiếng, chỉ bởi vì cô không thể chịu đựng được nữa cái trống rỗng bên trong mình:
“Kya biết Chase đã chọn không vào đại học mà đi làm cho bố. Cậu là người nổi bật trong thị trấn, là con gà trống. Và ở đâu đó bên trong, cô lo rằng mình chỉ là một mẫu vật đẹp mắt trên bờ biển, một thứ gây hiếu kỳ để cậu lật qua lật lại trong tay rồi ném trở ra bãi cát. Nhưng cô vẫn bước tiếp. Cô đã cho tình yêu một cơ hội; giờ cô chỉ muốn lấp đầy cái trống rỗng bên trong. Xoa dịu nỗi cô đơn trong khi dựng tường quây kín trái tim mình.”
Chase chỉ xem Kya như một con cái đặc biệt để chinh phục. Nếu Tate nhìn thấu vào được cả tâm hồn và tiềm năng của Kya, trân trọng niềm đam mê của cô dành cho chốn đồng lầy, thì tên sát gái nông cạn Chase chỉ thấy được vẻ đẹp bên ngoài của Kya: “Em đẹp rạng ngời, phóng khoáng tự do, và hoang dại như một ngọn gió.” - thứ khiến dân chúng quanh vùng nhìn nhận Kya bằng con mắt khác nhưng lại cuốn hút Chase - một con đực đến kỳ động dục. Sự khác biệt giữa Kya và Chase, cũng như việc Chase không hề thể hiện sự tôn trọng dành cho đam mê và hoài bão của người yêu mình, đã được thể hiện rõ ở những câu văn này:
“Như hầu hết mọi người, Chase coi đồng lầy là thứ để sử dụng, để đi thuyền và câu cá, hoặc rút cạn nước lấy đất làm nông, thế nên hiểu biết của Kya về những sinh vật của nó, dòng chảy và cỏ đuôi mèo làm cậu hứng thú. Nhưng cậu chế nhạo những cái động chạm khẽ khàng của cô, khi cô cho thuyền lặng lẽ lướt qua một chú hươu, hay nhỏ giọng thì thầm khi đến gần tổ chim nào đó. Cậu không có hứng thú tìm hiểu về vỏ sò hay lông vũ, và tỏ ra thắc mắc khi cô ghi chép vào sổ hoặc sưu tầm những mẫu vật đem về.”
Rồi khi Chase lộ nguyên hình là một kẻ lừa dối và chỉ muốn chiếm hữu Kya, niềm tin trong cô dành cho tình yêu đã gần như sụp đổ hoàn toàn. Việc phát hiện ra Chase phản bội cô là giọt nước làm tràn ly, đẩy Kya càng lún sâu hơn vào niềm tin rằng kết nối giữa người với người không bao giờ có thể trường tồn vĩnh viễn, cũng như ngoài tự nhiên, nơi con hươu đực có thể làm bất cứ điều gì để thu hút con cái, để rồi cuối cùng nó lại trở về với bản chất của một gã bạn tình láu cá. Đây là niềm tin mà mãi sau này Tate - khi đã nhận ra Kya luôn là tình yêu của đời mình - mới có thể giúp cô dần dần cởi bỏ và học cách tin tưởng tình yêu một lần nữa:
“Không phải tình cờ mà Chase tinh ranh nhắc tới hôn nhân làm mồi nhử, lập tức đưa cô lên giường rồi bỏ cô tới với cô gái khác. Qua tìm hiểu, cô đã biết con đực có thói lăng nhăng, vậy sao cô lại đổ trước gã trai này? Chiếc thuyền cao tốc của cậu ta cũng giống như cái cổ phồng lên và bộ sừng ngoại cỡ của một con hươu đực đến kỳ động dục: những món phụ kiện để đánh đuổi con đực khác và thu hút hết con cái nọ tới con cái kia. Vậy mà cô lại bị lừa bởi cùng trò bịp bợm như má: những gã bạn tình láu cá. Ba đã nói với má những lời dối gian chi; đã đưa bà tới những nhà hàng sang trọng nào trước khi tiền cạn kiệt và ông đưa bà về lãnh địa thực sự của mình - một cái lán đầm lầy? Có lẽ tình yêu tốt nhất nên để nguyên là một cánh đồng chưa gieo hạt.”
Song song với những diễn biến trong mối quan hệ tình cảm giữa Kya với Tate và Chase trong quá khứ, câu chuyện cũng dẫn dắt người đọc dõi theo vụ điều tra cái chết của Chase ở hiện tại, với nghi can chính là Kya. Việc thêm một vụ điều tra án mạng theo kiểu “whodunit” vào một câu chuyện tình cảm đầy những cung bậc và ngã rẽ là một quyết định khá khôn ngoan của tác giả. Điều này giúp biến tổng thể câu chuyện trở nên hấp dẫn hơn, đa chiều và đầy màu sắc hơn, cũng như giúp độc giả thấy được rõ hơn những ngóc ngách khác nhau trong tính cách và suy nghĩ của Kya. Cú plot twist khúc cuối đúng thật là không thể tin được, nhưng ngẫm lại thì quả đúng là chỉ có người đó mới có đủ lý do, động cơ, và khả năng tính toán để thực hiện được vụ án mạng mà thôi. Nhưng cụ thể cách thức thực hiện ra sao thì tác giả không nói rõ, mặc dù xem lại lời khai của các nhân chứng thì tôi cũng có thể mường tượng ra lời giải thích rồi.

When I heard the movie was coming out and after seeing the trailer I decided to read it then see the movie. I devoured 3/4 of this book over a few hours and was literally finishing it sitting in the car before the movie started! Crazy I know. So? I LOVED this book. So exquisitely written. Such incredible characters that sucked me in. A storyline that held my attention and took me to another world. I am stunned at reviews that say it’s boring, badly written and given up on before 150 pages in. Right now my ok concentration is crap. For a book to hold me is a miracle hence not much read in 2022. I totally disagree with the reviews like that but hey everyone is different. Don’t let negative reviews (even from top reviewers) put you off. Try it for yourself. Often a book that’s detailed can be bland but not this one. The incredible descriptions of the marsh that is so loved by Kya blew my mind. The amount of research done is formidable. I adored Kya. What a life from a young child to her most adult of experiences. It pulls at the heart strings but I felt a whirlwind of emotions reading this incredible novel. It was not what I expected at all. I have cried over 5 books in my whole lifetime and this became number 6. For words on paper to move me to tears is a huge feat. It’s a story of tragedy, pain, courage, trauma, friendship, love, loss and justice amongst many other things. There was nothing I didn’t love. I’m not going to tell if the story as it’s got to be read. I will say the movie I felt let the book down massively. Why they juggled around timelines and left out so much important detail I don’t know. I did take tissues knowing what was to come. One thing good about the movie as the main twist was a bit clearer on screen. The ending keeps you thinking and quite possibly crying with a lot of emotions going on. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I knew Delia had written non-fiction but as her first novel the hype is spot on. Do read the book before the movie. I’m interested to hear your comments if you’ve read it. A huge 5 stars. It worked well for me to finish the book literally 15 minutes from the movie starting. A beautiful book that is filled with so much beauty in the midst of darkness. Thanks so much for reading my review of this book. Join me as a friend or follower and feel free to browse my shelves for your next great book! Do share your comments on this book.

I suspect I might have been a victim of hearing too much hype about this book. Normally that doesn't get to me, but I wonder if maybe I was expecting more based on others love for this. But, there were things I liked! This book has so many 5-star reviews, I think others will enjoy it more than I did!In North Carolina, Kya Clark lives out in the marshes bordering a small town. She lives in a shack and the townspeople treat her as a bit of an outcast. Her family fled her abusive father. But though Kya is treated as an outsider, she also happens to be beautiful. The Marsh Girl, they call her, somewhat cruelly.When a local man Chase Andrews is found dead, his body located in the marshes, Kya soon becomes the prime suspect. She isn't really one of them, and that makes her naturally suspicious to them. After all, in a small town you are either one of them, or you are out.With elements of romance and mystery, this had all of the components of a great book. Unfortunately for me, it had a YA feel. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but it felt like a genre mismatch somehow. It isn't intended as YA, so to have the feel of YA took me out of the story a bit.I will say loved the rich descriptions, especially of the nature, and I could envision the settings. I felt sometimes it needed more reflection and introspection. Perhaps it was due to the audiobook, but I felt like it was being told to me, but not like I was fully invested in the emotions.All in all a good book that I know many have loved!"

But to have two books in a week end up on my favorites shelf? That's pretty darn good. This was a book that I am definitely glad I listened to rather than read. Cassandra Campbell brings the words alive and even the poetry and ""country"" dialect were beautiful as she read them. Sometimes when I read poetry or dialects like that myself, my eyes tend to skim over it. But listening to someone read it the way she does helped bring it alive for me. I loved Kya, the main character, and also her supporting characters, especially Tate, Jumpin' and Mabel. And even though I knew how the book had to end and I even predicted it (the author left clues earlier on), it didn't matter--I still loved listening to the story unfold. If you're a fan of beautiful prose and great character development, definitely give this a try!"

It was an incredible read. I loved the steady build of the mystery and how it made you go back and forth on your guess of what happened. I did find the first half just a little slow, but Kya’s character was very well developed. I felt so sad for Kya as a child, but it was amazing how she survived on her own. She was quietly confident and accepted who she was, but she also found ways to challenge herself to grow. The ending was perfect! I kept wondering about the crime and loved how the author tied up all the loose ends. It was amazing to find out that this was the author’s first novel. You could tell she knew a lot about ecology. She combined multiple genres and broached different topics well. The plot was well thought out. Overall, this was one of my favorite books I’ve read. (:"
300,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50169830-hoolia,Rating 1 out of 5,"I was expecting to enjoy this more than I did, considering the high rating. But it just all felt staged to me. I didn't feel connected to any of the characters, who were all very two-dimensional. Everyone had a clear role to play as either Good or Bad or Tragic and you could tell which one they were as soon as you met them. Doesn't a book about nature hold a little more room for nuance?I know a lot of readers mentioned that they enjoyed the role that nature played, but that actually bothered me--nature was only really examined when it was convenient to the plot, instead of being its own character, and it seems to me that Kya, who is supposedly this intense naturalist, would have enjoyed nature more for its own merits and courses rather than just how it applied to her own problems. I would've liked to see more of her own examination of natural processes rather than just ""look at females animals they're so different and I'm different too, I'm not like other girls."" There was no intensive study of isolation either, which I also would've liked to see. If Kya really grew up all on her own, wouldn't she meditate extensively on the nature of isolation and loneliness? The limited thoughts she did have about this seemed cliché, ie ""everyone's abandoned me, trust no one, I don't need anyone to survive"" etc etc. Nothing original at all. In addition, the book tries its hardest to be scientifically and historically accurate. And yet despite its discussion of marsh ecology and the history of this area of North Carolina, there's no mention of the four major hurricanes that hit North Carolina during this time period. How would a small child have survived the severe flooding that followed these storms? How would a marsh shack have held up during 150 mph winds? Additionally, Kya magically never gets majorly ill, despite having zero healthcare and no access to vaccines--polio was still around in the 50s, people. She never gets an ovarian cyst, she never gets swollen wisdom teeth, no broken bones, not so much as a twisted ankle or a high fever. The only time she gets injured is when someone beats her up. And the mentions of people casually driving down to Asheville, which is on the other end of the state and would have taken them at least a day of travel, when other major cities are closer? Yeah, not happening. This is a book that puts on all the appearances of being realistic without actually putting in much work. Maybe I missed something by listening to the audiobook, but I just didn't understand the appeal."
301,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11701608-barbara,Rating 3 out of 5,"“Where The Crawdads Sing” is a book club selection of mine. It’s a popular novel, in most part thanks to Reese Witherspoon. It’s chic-lit and a fast read. Most of my group really liked it, with the exception of one who thought it was “preposterous” LOL. So, if you accept the premise that a 6-year-old girl could raise herself in the swamps/marshes of North Carolina, you will enjoy it. Is it realistic fiction? I think not, but it’s a good read.Catherine “Kya” Clark is the brave girl who is abandoned first by her mother, and then by all four of her siblings because of her physically abusive and vicious father. One can understand getting out of that situation; what is difficult to understand is leaving a six year old with a drunk and a pauper. So, she raises herself with the help of a local boat store operator and his wife. She becomes a beauty and gains the attraction of a couple of boys, one good and one not so good.There is a murder and Kya becomes a suspect. The townspeople always shunned her because she was a “swamp girl”. No one helped her and all avoided her while she was growing up. Once she becomes a prime suspect in a murder, the town folk instantly condemn her. It’s a story of growing up in a prejudice small town. Author Delia Owens does a fabulous job of writing about the beauty of the marshes. "

Or is Reese Witherspoon that powerful??(she is)Overall Rating : BWaited 3 month for this book at my library, read it in three days and all I can say is ""meh"".Definitely not the kind of book I usually read and that's probably why it didn't strike a cord with me as it has other people. Don't see how this book has been so popular. Wasn't too fast or too slow. No action whatsoever. This is the kind of book where you can sit and relax and enjoy the flowing story of Kya Clark.This is the Life of the Marsh Girl - how she survived on her own when her family one by one left her to fend for herself and essentially became one with said Marsh with a couple of cute boys to grab you in. The murder doesn't really add much to the story as the book is mostly centered on Kya's life growing up, this book could easily have been the same if the murder didn't happen. Pretty predictable as books come. Like I said, wasn't really impressed given the hype but can see why a majority of people would try to grab it. And now the other 40 people waiting on this book at my library are one step closer to reading this as well. Let's hope they enjoy what this book brings more than I did."
303,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20940446-dianne,Rating 5 out of 5,"I love this story. There are so many facets to the novel: the wonders of nature described in breathtaking detail, the power of love, the complexity of a large, poor, rural family plus the mysterious death of the town's all American boy. There are several possible suspects with both the motive and the opportunity to kill the 24 year old. You must read to the final few pages to discover who committed the crime. Delia Owens, the author, has a PhD in Zoology. She uses her knowledge of animal behaviour to explain human behaviour. This I found fascinating. Also of interest to me was an activity which I have thought of many times in my life but have never heard described by anyone before. Like the Marsh Girl I loved to go fishing with my dad in his rowboat. Like her I hated to watch the fish die at my feet. ""Secretly Kya hoped not to catch a fish, but she felt a tug, jerked her line, and raised a thick bream, flashing silver and blue. Pa leaned out and snatched it in the net. Before Pa strung it up, the bream flopped around in the boat bottom and Kya had to watch a distant string of pelicans, study the cloud forms, anything but look into dying fish eyes staring at a world without water, wide mouth sucking worthless air. But what it cost her and what it cost that fish was worth it to have this little shred of family. Perhaps not for the fish, but still."""

306,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3857699-melissa-crytzer-fry,Rating 4 out of 5,"I was fascinated by this book when I first learned about author Delia Owens’s background studying wildlife in Africa, and her awards as a nature writer. I was in the mood for a book lush in setting and critters and love of the earth. I had hoped this book would fill that need. When the introduction discussed the roots of this story – involving a personal experience with a female baboon – I knew I was off to a good start. (Don’t stop reading if you’re not interested in baboons; this book has nothing to do with them directly!)Indeed, that first chapter sucked me right into the glowing, wildlife-filled marshes and the blackened, fetid swamps of North Carolina. And I fell in love with the young protagonist, Kya. Not generally a fan of younger narrators or coming-of-age stories, that did not stop me from being fascinated and in awe of Kya’s survival skills and her tie to the marsh and its inhabitants.The author’s background in science is evident in the book, but not heavy-handed. She blends insight about coastal marsh mammals, fish, birds and various flora, with biological reproductive facts and behaviors, weaving them effortlessly into the story and drawing parallels to human behavior. I learned fascinating information about lightning bugs and praying mantises that I did not know previously, and they were a perfect thematic fit that illustrated Kya’s intense love of the marsh.The language is often downright gorgeous and sensory in this book that includes themes of nature, motherhood, love, bonding, betrayal, family, prejudice, and murder. This book also includes art and poetry (though, for me, the insertion of the poetry sometimes felt like it broke the flow of the narrative).This novel is almost a two-for-one in that it is not only truly a character-driven story of emotion and betrayal, but also a murder mystery. Naturally, given my reading tastes (which don’t include mysteries), I was drawn more to the emotional side of the story. And I feel it is here where the author excels -- with the more literary aspects of the book. Even so, I think mystery readers will find the book quite rewarding. Thank you to Goodreads First Reads program and Penguin Random House/Putnam for the chance to read an ARC of this book before release. I look forward to this author’s future work."
307,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/873807-elaine-mullane-elaine-and-the-books,Rating 5 out of 5,"Set between 1952 and 1970, in a narrative that moves back and forward in tension-building order, Where the Crawdads Sing is a beautifully lush novel that follows the life of Kya Clark as she grows up in the marshland of a coastal community in North Carolina. Abandoned by her mother, siblings and, eventually, her father, Kya leans on nature to help her survive, acquiring hunting and fishing skills to provide both food and opportunities for trade. Kya doesn't go to school and is the subject of the stories of the locals in the small town beyond the creek. The book opens with a prologue set in 1969 in which a young local man has died suspiciously in the swamp. The rest of the book cuts between the investigation, in which the accusatory locals believe 'the swamp girl' is responsible, and flashbacks to Kya’s youth and young adulthood. The date-jumbling narrative moves seamlessly, building on the story in the most effective way. Kya becomes so much more than a protagonist: she is a unique, brave and fascinating heroine and you will love her.Kind, local 'tutors' help Kya along the way: Tate, a friend of her older brother, teaches Kya how to read; a local African-American man buys Kya's fish and in turn sells her the things she needs, and his wife clothes Kya, and teaches her about men and menstruation. But Kya's main caretaker is always nature. And she trusts her implicitly. I loved everything about this book. It is an incredible story about resilience and survival, as well as hope, friendship and love. Even without the 'whodunit' storyline, this would be a very good book, but the murder mystery aspect only helps to intensify the insular whisperings of a small community who choose to treat Kya as an outsider. What is truly remarkable about this book is how atmospheric it is. The sights and sounds of the swamp are evoked so wonderfully, allowing you to walk in Kya's shoes, through her vibrant surroundings. Delia Owens isn't just a wildlife scientist, she is a very talented storyteller with a wonderful insight into the human condition.5 stars. One of my favourite reads of 2018/2019."

Easy for him to say, he hasn't read it, and I'm sure will never do. I turned off my computer and started to discuss with him a paragraph about physics this book included. He didn't understand what I was saying, made me find that part and show him. He read it twice, closed the book, looked at me, and said - ""go on, write your bad review"".Oh, yes, this one is getting a bad review from me.Here I am sitting, reading this story, which is not great, but is not bad either (not bad - first 10 pages). It's one of the hypes you see on GR, with a plot interesting enough not to make you drop the book, but with bad writing to roll eyes. I even created a new shelf in its honor adding there the books like this. Three of them, all three stars. Or so I thought...So, sitting, reading... and BOOM!A Court scene. A very bad court scene. A lousy one. I could close my eyes on poor characters, the worst dialogues ever, but not the court scenes. I am not going to give lectures on how to create an acceptable scene, but at least she could watch Suits TV series to see how it works (as she is looking for the hype).Or maybe the Judge for how to choose jury members.Or something more advanced - My Cousin Vinny - one of the best court scene movies!P.S.

Poate că am fost păcălită de prea multe ori, mai ales în ultimii 2-3 ani, însă mă bucur că Acolo unde cântă racii a fost o excepție de la regulă. Romanul mi-a sfâșiat sufletul în mii de bucățele. M-a făcut să mă simt mică, neputincioasă și nedrept de privilegiată. Mi-a amintit cât de egoiști și nepăsători suntem cu cei din jur, cum îi ignorăm (pe nedrept) pe cei care încearcă să ne protejeze, cât de ușor putem să fim manipulați când iubim „orbește” și cât de puternice sunt legăturile din copilărie.Nu prea știu ce aș putea să spun despre Kya Clark, poreclită cu răutate Fata Mlaștinii, ca să-i pun în valoare instinctul de supraviețuire, spiritul neîmblânzit, curiozitatea înnăscută sau bunătatea exploatată fără milă de locuitorii din Barkley Cove. Abandonată la o vârstă fragedă de familie, Kya locuiește singură într-un ținut sălbatic, nelipsit de pericole, unde natura o protejează și o hrănește, învățând-o tainele vieții. Drumul spre maturizare e aspru, umbrit de răutăți, provocări și obstacole. Kya este un spirit al naturii și o nimfă a pădurii. Cunoaște lăcașurile secrete din mlaștini, descoperă cum să trăiască în condiții precare și învață să citească. Devorează cu lăcomie orice informație nouă, este sinceră și curajoasă, puternică și vulnerabilă în egală măsură. O eroină atipică. Un suflet chinuit, cel puțin la prima vedere, ostracizat fără milă de o societate ce ar fi trebuit să-l ocrotească.Am văzut-o în diferite ipostaze (copil, adolescent, adult) și i-am urmărit cu sufletul la gură evoluția. I-am împărtășit bucuria când literele s-au transformat în cuvinte, mi-am șters ochii când a fost respinsă sau rănită, am zâmbit cu mândrie când pasiunea ei a căpătat proporții uimitoare, punându-i în valoare talentele și dragostea pentru natură.Acolo unde cântă racii este un roman pe care nu am să-l uit prea curând. Dragoste, dorință, iertare și speranță. Răutate și abuz. O odă închinată naturii, o poveste dulce-amară de dragoste și o lecție despre maturizare, forță și descoperirea identității."

I´m so glad I waited to watch the movie and read the book before. I am late I know, but this book was chosen for my book club so…Anyway, this book destroyed me. I took a little to warm up to it, it´s written splendidly, but with a thick southern accent, and for not English (actually American) mother tongue it can be difficult. Anyway, I came to appreciate this difficulty, it was the same struggle Kya was going through in her childhood, alone and with little way of understanding and being understood. As the book progressed, both because I got used to the writing and because Kya became more and more acculturated, the story became smoother and faster-paced. I think going into this book it´s mandatory to read a little about Delia Owens's background. I was astonished by her knowledge of nature and around 30% of the book I read more about her background as a zoologist and natural science doctor. This not just makes extreme sense, but also makes the reading experience so much better. The moment I became aware all the little things were not fiction, but it was a well-crafted frame to explain human and natural behavior, it was like I was reading with a completely new set of eyes.This story was so different and overwhelming.Kya is one in a million, a pure soul and resilient nature, a survivor of others' cruelty. I am convinced this book is not for everyone but is also something all should read. This book teaches the reader how sometimes a small gesture can change everything, how a single event can shape a person, how difficult it is to learn when few are ready to help, but mainly how a person can do anything, and achieve everything with resilience and willingness. Like in nature, this book explains there is no right or wrong and people are mainly ruled by the surroundings and the pack's behavior, we see it many times throughout the book, starting with Kya´s mother -and brother, and father-, passing through Chase, finishing with Kya herself. The last 25% of the book is so good I cried so much I couldn´t see anymore. It truly broke me."

Έτσι λοιπόν, ξεκίνησα την ανάγνωση αυτού του βιβλίου που φέρει όλους τους παραπάνω τίτλους και αλλους ακόμη, με υψηλές προσδοκίες και έναν μικρό φόβο. Παρόλα αυτά ο φόβος αυτός κράτησε πολύ λίγο καθώς το βιβλίο με κέρδισε από τις πρώτες σελίδες του. Η γραφή είναι τόσο ζωντανή και γλαφυρή που κρατά το ενδιαφέρον αμείωτο ως την τελευταία πρόταση. Η ιστορία της Κάια,που από πολύ μικρή αναγκάζεται να πάρει τη ζωή της εξ'ολοκληρου στα χέρια της, είναι μια ιστορία ενηλικίωσης που συνδυάζει τα παντα:τη μοναξιά και τη συντροφικοτητα, την αγάπη και το μίσος, την ανάγκη για εξέλιξη, αλλά και την ανάγκη για την επαφή με την απλότητα της φύσης. Κυρίως όμως μιλά για το ποσο η παιδική μας ηλικία και τα βιώματα μας σε αυτήν, μας επηρεάζουν και μας περνάνε δεσμά, τα οποία μόνο αν σπάσουμε - παίρνοντας μεγάλο ρίσκο ομολογουμενως-μπορούμε να ανακαλύψουμε ποιοι πραγματικά είμαστε. Είναι ένα βιβλίο που αξίζει να διαβαστεί για πολλούς και διαφορετικούς λόγους και μια ιστορία που πραγματικά μαγεύει τον αναγνωστη."

Numečiau knygą nebaigus skaityti, tiesiog nenoriu gaišti laiko tokiai banalybei. Jau iš pat pradžių nepatiko ji man, istorijos apie visų paliktus ir apleistus mažamečius vaikus, kurie stebuklingai savim pasirūpina, yra ne man. Iš pradžių Kaja yra visų atstumtoji, vadinama Pelkų dukra ir nemoka skaityti iki 14-os metų. Bet vėliau tik sprakt pirštais ir prasideda... Užauga į gražuolę vapsvos liemeniu ir putliom lūpom, vaikinai jau kreipia dėmesį į ją, išmoksta skaityti ir po kelių metų talentai pasipila kaip iš Amaltėjos Gausybės rago.

316,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71792610-renee-godding,Rating 4 out of 5,"“ Kya laid her hand upon the breathing, wet earth, and the marsh became her mother.“4/5 stars One of my first introductions into reading American literature in its original language was Snow Falling on Cedars by David Gutterson. Clearly, it was a successful intro, as I adored it, and it opened a gateway for me into reading in English pretty much exclusively now. Although there are many differences, Where The Crawdads Sing brought me back to that first reading experience with David Gutterson: a story centered around a court trial in an isolated small town, that leads all involved to revisit memories from years ago. Themes of prejudice, forbidden love and coming of age under unusual circumstances, all pressed together under a dense atmosphere and lush nature writing. Kya has been alone all her life. After her mother walks out without warning one day, leaving her alone with her abusive and mostly absent father, Kya is left to fend for herself in their small home on the outskirts of town. She retreats down into the local swamps and finds her new home there, where she grows up with Mother Earth as her only parent. Shunned all her life by the town people as the pariah “Swamp Girl”, it is to be expected that she is the first to be blamed when a local young man she has known since childhood is found dead near her swamps. Apart from revisiting that Snow Falling on Cedars-vibe, there was a lot for me to love in this novel, above all else the voice in which it was narrated. Delia Owens’ background as a biologist shows in the vividness of her nature writing. Her words bring the pressingly humid marsh setting with all its flora and critters to life to the point where I could almost hear the buzz of insects and smell that heavy, earthy smell of murky water and slightly rotten leaves. I can already say that it’ll most likely be this setting that sticks with me for a long time, possibly even longer than the story itself. The marsh’s almost a character in its own right: acting almost as a parent to Kya in a way. It takes a lost child into its warm, humid embrace, feeds her and protects her. It sings her stories and lullabies in the voices of cicada’s and crawdads, and teaches her the skills and values she’ll carries into adulthood. Nature writing can be a hit or miss for me, but in this case Owens strikes a nice balance of paralleling scenes from the marsh’s wildlife to Kya’s coming of age, without overdoing it, and I loved it. I was a little skeptical when the murder-mystery and trial became more at the center of the story, but ended up enjoying that part the most. It was so interesting to me, seeing the way the town-folk view and react to Kya, and how their prejudices affect their opinions on the trial. Unfortunately, I do have one small gripe, which was the “sag” this book experienced at about 1/3 of the way through. Around page 100-150, very little happens and things become a little repetitive. I could tell that the author was trying to develop her characters more in this part, but as amazing the author is at nature writing, I could tell a little that this was her debut when it comes to character development. I know I’m not the only person who experienced this lag here, as the few 1-star or DNF-reviews I’ve seen all seem to quit around this point. That being said: not a full 5-star read for me, but definitely a 4 or maybe even 4.5. If you enjoy nature writing combined with a coming of age story, want to read about the resilience of a young girl out on her own or just want to be completely transported to the Carolinian wetlands: this one is for you!"

Тази книга раздроби сърцето ми на парченца и ми е трудно да ги събера... А мислите ми- още по- малко. Не мога да кажа нищо повече. Ревю- утре.Update:""Където пеят раците"" е мелодична книга, написана с много нежност от човек, който е отдал сърцето си на животните. Връзката на Дилия Оуенс с природата е много силна. Още от малка, майка ѝ я насърчава да опознава и изследва смело дивия свят, което по- късно става и неин начин на живот. Дилия Оуенс е зоолог и любовта ѝ към природата и животинския свят прелива в романът ѝ "" Където пеят раците"". Именно с тези думи майка ѝ я изпращала да се гмурка дръзко в непознатото и в дивото. Така този израз се превръща в символ на свободата на духа, независимостта и сливането с природата, което самата авторка прехвърля в сюжета на книгата си. Дилия Оуенс е толкова описателна, че те пренася с лекота в мочурищата на Северна Каролина, в света на Кая, и ти говори с чистотата и мъдростта на едно бързо пораснало дете.Чувствата и мислите на Кая прозират из цялата история и сякаш неусетно се просмукаха в мен. Скитах се с нея около мочурището, седях на стълбите пред колибата да чакам Мама, тъгувах, загледана в далечината, а сърцето ми се беше сковало от тревога да не бъда изоставена от всички, сама... Виждах я как едва шестгодишна, нейните детски, безгрижни години, се изпаряваха като дим, как ѝ се налагаше да се сблъска със света на възрастните и да се научи да оцелява в него. А докато оцеляваше, се ковеше и нейната сила. Усещах как Кая е разкъсвана от любовта към нейното мочурище и копнежа да бъде сред хората, да има приятели, да бъде приета. Проследявах как тя расте и се превръща в млада жена... И покрай цялата история на Кая, аз осъзнавах, че дори човек да е затънал в калта, винаги има начин да се измъкне, стига да не спре да се опитва... Тази книга провокира много емоции и колкото и да се опитвах да се абстрахирам от тях, те ме покориха. Историята лъкатуши между две сюжетни линии, в едната от които има вкаран криминален елемент. Дори и той ми хареса, въпреки че в началото го мислех за излишен и неуместен. Просто цялата история е написана с толкова чувство и с такова сърце, че единственото нещо, което можех да сторя е да отворя моето широко. ""Където пеят раците"" може да не е литературен шедьовър, но е книга, която може да събуди заспалите емоции у човек. Много искрена, много чувствена, много наситена с преживявания. P. S: Изключително красив превод! Респект! И...прекрасна корица и оформление."

Tellingly, this novel is written with such care that it’s truth in setting seeps off of the page like sap on a fast growing, heavily chipped tree! A must read for anyone with interest in mystery/crime or that just enjoy a riveting tale, but that don’t have issues with characterisation and continuity, as this is wrought with those and other silly contradictions, leaps and other small but frustrating trips that render the story just too much for me to be able to handle.Written more like a nature novel than a crime-fiction at times, the authors heritage comes to the fore, often. Believability becomes a factor late and I for one at just glad I read this before it became the hyped of hype novels otherwise I may not have gotten to experience some lovely elements. The overly sappy parts also were an issue for me, it kind of felt like it was the author overcompensating perhaps due to her background and making sure she captured more emotive themes, but it ends up just being far too much of a over-cooked, overdone version of a solid premise!I edited this down a half star after a moderately heated debate with my mother whom loved it, as it made me realise that I had no place rounding up to 3 stars!"

Kya is one of the best characters I've read. I was fully invested in her and found the first half of the book very sad following her after her abandonment.

325,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57725883-rob,Rating 4 out of 5,"Stand alone novel by Delia Owens published 2018.This is a beautifully written sadly poignant tale of a young girl, continuing into adulthood, who is shunned by society and who, in turn, turns her back of the society that shuns her. The tale gives new meaning to what we now call self isolation.We meet Kya Clark at the age of six living an impoverished life in the swamp lands of North Carolina. This is the moment when Kya watches her mother walk away from home never to return. Her mother is only the first of many who will leave Kya behind leaving her feeling alone and unloved.Now completely alone and very, very young Kya does what she has had to do for most of her young life, survive the best she can.Along the way people do enter her life that should bring her happiness but they to end up leaving her behind.So turning her back on what we would call a normal happy life Kya dedicates her life to studying the natural history of the swamp in all its amazing beauty.There are many trials and tribulation for Kya to overcome but her biggest trial is when she is accused of murder. The local population positively salivate at the prospect of watching Kya stand in court charged with murder, such is the prejudice felt towards her. Whilst this is a compelling read I have to admit to feeling a degree of frustration towards Kya. There is no doubt that she had it tough but she almost seems to wallow in her own misery. Along the way she is given opportunities that would have changed her life, for the better, but chose to reject people and continue to live in isolation. As for the trial, that really was a joke. To build a case for first degree murder and asking for the death penalty on nothing but hearsay and circumstantial evidence and without a single peace of hard evidence just beggar’s belief. But apart for what I consider to be the books failures, as mentioned above, this is a book I think most people will be able to immerse themselves in. A creative and enjoyable, if at times frustrating, read. 4 stars."

I was heavily invested at the start, thought for sure I was reading a 5 book, then the plot began to unravel and meander and I had to look away from what was not really a believable existence in the marshland. What I admire and what Owens did so well was to show the majesty and beauty of the wild, but not so much the dangers and problems. Where were the water snakes? The land snakes? Swamp fevers? The mosquitoes when making love in ferns? And other wild insects and creatures I'm sure live in that part of the state. And other wild men, besides the convenient one to the plot. Wilderness is yin and yang, just as people are.On the plus side, I loved that this wild book did so well. That many people were willing to slow down and read and appreciate. But what for me began as something unique and special ended as many other plots have ended (I knew the ending well before I got there). Sigh. First third a 5, second two-thirds a 3, so altogether a 4...I did keep reading and I did root for Kya. Then my feelings for her became complicated. I'll leave it at that so as not to spoil the ending.I read that the author knew the ending and worked backward. I don't know if that caused issues. Sometimes you have to let the character take you where she/he wants to take you. Not sure Kya took the right journey. But that's just my opinion. Still worth a read to make your own judgement!***Update 1/26/20: Just read most of this New Yorker article (very long). It makes my reading of this book even more complicated.

Faptul ca o recomanda clubul de lectura al lui Reese Whiterspoon nu era pentru mine o garantie neaparat, caci ea a recomandat la fel de mult si Ceva in apa, care pentru mine a fost o dezamagire, dar la fel a recomandat si Eleanor Oliphant se simte excelent, pe care am adorat-o sau Mici focuri pretutindeni, care mi-a placut destul de mult. Asadar am inceput cartea cu inima indoita. Dar imi pare bine ca am citit-o!Acolo unde canta racii creeaza o atmosfera ireala, in mlastina in care o fata este abandonata de tot restul familiei ei, rand pe rand, si este nevoita sa se descurce singura. Izolarea in care fata traieste, de care este pe deplin constienta, este aproape palpabila. Curiozitatea de a afla cum se va descurca, ce se va alege de ea, cine a comis crima care apare inca din primele pagini, secvential, in naratiune, este suficient de puternica pentru parcurge cartea cu repeziciune. Eu am mai citit inainte carti in care natura avea o pondere considerabila, de aveai senzatia ca urmaresti un documentar pe National Geographic, dar chiar nu sunt genul meu (The Lone Wolf - Jodi Picoult, spre exemplu). Dar naratiunea Deliei Owens este cu totul speciala iar destinul lui Kya este unul fascinant. Cartea mi-a adus aminte de Inainte sa fim ai vostri, de Lisa Wingate, nu doar prin locatie, mlastina, ci si prin vocea naratoarelor, Rill si Kya. "

I felt with and for Kya from the first chapter, and these feelings only became more intense as the story progressed. The book alternates between two different time periods. 1952, Kya, a 6 year old girl, is abandoned by her family in the wilderness and left to raise herself. 1969, Chase Andrews, the town's golden boy, is found dead and locals immediately suspect that Kya was responsible. The story is set in a North Carolina coastal marsh, and the author's love and beautiful descriptions of nature is one of the elements that makes this book so uniquely ethereal. The marsh, so full of live, is one of the main characters in this book, and the relationship between it and Kya is one of the most heartfelt love stories I've ever read. Pushing against the sea's strong body, she is grasped, held. Not alone....but whenever she stumbled, it was the land that caught her.Where the Crawdads Sing is a coming of age story, mystery and a love letter to nature. But above all this is an exquisite exploration of a life defined by loneliness, longing and isolation. Kya will stay with me for a very long time."
