0,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"This book starts off really strong with a great premise - intriguing and mysterious right away - the writing is even pretty strong in the beginning, but somewhere along the way it all seemed to fall apart for me. I felt like the author was so determined to deliver the big ‘twist’ that he lost sight of the actual plot. It just gets so convoluted and meandering, and I couldn’t really follow what actually happened, from what was meant to be the lies and fantasy of some characters. The author also spends an awful lot of the book having the main character, Theo, ‘investigate’ Alicia’s family members - the cousin, the aunt, the brother in law, her gallery manager - and each of them is made to seem weird, untrustworthy and in some cases outright creepy - but all of it ends up just feeling like a cheap trick, because nothing comes of any of them. Like, for example, the plot about the brother in law assaulting her, or the cousin borrowing money, - none of those things are resolved and it just feels like a lazy way for the author to point our suspicions in the wrong direction while leaving frustrating loose ends everywhere. I mean, you can make any character seem suspicious and create false suspense very easily if you have no obligation to deliver any resolutions. In the author’s single quest to deliver the big ‘twist’ he also left big holes in the plot and expected us to overlook implausible things... like, one small but obvious thing - at the start of the book Theo’s belongings are searched by ‘security’ before entering the hospital and he is specifically told he can’t have any lighters for “obvious reasons” - can’t have any of the psychiatric patients getting their hands on a way to start fires - (now the author didn’t need to mention this in the story - he could have lost this scene and not drawn attention to the fact that Theo was not allowed to bring in a lighter - not sure why it was even a point??) but then through out the book the characters smoke cigars and cigarettes in the hospital ... how do they light them?? They all carry matches I assume? Are matches any less likely to start a fire??! There were SO MANY eye-rolling moments through out the book like that one, and far worse. So many times we, as readers, were expected to buy into implausible actions by characters (like Alicia’s cousin beating Theo over the head with a baseball bat and knocking him out because he thought he was an intruder (in his yard - not even his house!), and then not to mention Theo feeling fine and not needing any medical attention??) or just overlook unbelievable scenarios - like Theo following his wife’s lover for miles and never once actually seeing his face?? When the police investigate the scene of Alicia’s husband’s death, how do they not find the rope and wire that was used to tie up Alicia? And Who has enough rope and wire just lying around in their house to tie up two adults anyway?! And another doozy - Theo injects Alicia with enough morphine to put her in a coma for the rest of her life, but she has time to find a pen and diary and write a very lucid, long entry explaining Theo’s role in everything?! Besides the fact that she would be completely out of it and totally incapable of writing, even if she could, why wouldn’t she, I don’t know, go get help because you’ve just been injected with a lethal dose of morphine, instead of writing a short story??! And then with a lethal amount of morphine coursing through her blood stream she takes the time to hide her diary in a picture frame?! Seriously?! It’s almost funny.And what about Alicia’s silence?? The mystery at the heart of the book - in the very title itself. The big reveal, the big answer shrouded in suspense and mystery .... the reason she didn’t talk was because she felt she had nothing to say??? Because she felt like she was dead too?? Wait... what? Seriously? She’s been accused of murdering her husband, while the man who stalks her, breaks in to her home, ties her up and threatens to kill her later shows up as her therapist, while she allows her other therapist to continue drugging her with “horse dosage” amounts of sedatives - but oh well, silence for years and years because she felt dead and had nothing to say?? And she stays silent mind you, while she still manages to hide her diary?!? We can only assume she goes to extreme measures to keep the police from ever finding it? Even though they walk in right after the murder while she’s still holding the smoking gun - I guess they gave her time to gather her things and somehow hide a diary down her pants while she was brought to prison?? Not to mention how no one found it when she was transferred to the mental hospital?! Why go to so much trouble to hide a diary if you feel like you’re dead and you have nothing to say!? Giant eye roll.I’m sorry - this book just asks too much of the reader - this ‘twist’ has been done many times before and it only works (and still very poorly) if you overlook all the giant plot holes and ridiculous scenarios."
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is easily one of the best mystery/thrillers, if not the best, I have ever read.Alicia shoots her beloved husband in the face five times, then never speaks another word. Theo, a psychotherapist, is captivated by Alicia's story and wants to help her. He thinks he can get her to speak again and divulge why she killed her husband. What follows is a search for truth in what really happened between Alicia and her husband.First of all, if you haven't read this book yet, you absolutely should. And you should stop reading my review and any other reviews/blurbs/thoughts about this book until you do. Because while I always strive to make my reviews 100% spoiler-free (this one included), there's something to be said for expectations. And there's no way reading anything about this book wouldn't sway your expectations.I made the mistake, after reading this book and loving it, of not only recommending it to a friend, but also talking up how much this book amazed me, how great the reveals were, yada yada yada. And so when she read it, she had built up an inkling of something to come and anticipated it, hence losing the element of surprise. So I inadvertently committed the biggest book faux-paus ever and ruined a fantastic book for a friend. It's something I regret to this day. (Elaine, if you're reading this, I'm so sorry!)I certainly don't want to do that again. So yeah, I'm warning you. Last chance to turn back if you haven't read this book.Okay, now that I'm among only those who are in the know, I feel like I can freely gush. How amazing was that reveal?! I usually have terrible book memory, but I'm certain I will remember that reveal for the rest of my life. It wasn't just what it was, but also how it was executed. Not only did I not see the twist coming, but I was so surprised I stared open-mouthed at my book and reread it multiple times to make sure my brain could comprehend the complete mind bend of what I had just experienced.But to simplify this story down to just its reveal feels like an injustice. At its heart, this is a confounding murder mystery and it includes all of the requisite parts—clues, suspicious persons, and red herrings. We are directed one way, then another. But like any great mystery, the real magic is in its sleight of hand. While we are focused on one thing, really something else is going on altogether. And at the end, we can only wonder at the sheer audacity of what it takes to pull off such a magical feat.The story grabbed me from the very beginning with an intensity that didn't let go. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. I was turning the pages as fast as I could, immersed in the experience and loving every moment. It only took me a few hours to get through the whole thing, and at the end my head was definitely left spinning in the best way possible.Recently, I read it again. I wanted to see if the magic of the first time is still there or if, now knowing the twists, the story would feel lesser than. And I'm so happy to report that I loved it just as much the second time around. Now, instead of having to pay attention to the plot, I could really focus on how masterfully Alex Michaelides built up the mystery and its reveal. And it really is something to marvel at.I have to say, books of this genre are always billed as astounding and surprising when most of the time they just feel contrived and silly with no payoff at the end. But wow, does this book deliver! It's so darn satisfying to read such a compulsively addicting story, with twists done right that left me absolutely speechless.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The MaidensThe Fury~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47207032-chelsea-humphrey,Rating 3 out of 5,"CONGRATULATIONS-Goodreads Choice Awards Mystery & Thriller Winner!I feel like I should preface my review by stating that I have read A LOT of psychological thrillers, and coupling that with the fact that this was my most anticipated read of 2019 gave The Silent Patient a great deal of pressure. This will still be an overall positive review, but I felt I had to include some honest thoughts here as well for those readers who may need their expectations in line like I clearly did. The premise here is simply incredible; we have a woman named Alicia Berenson who is accused of murdering her husband and proceeds to clam up and keep quiet for the following six years, living during this time in a mental care facility called The Grove for highly dangerous folks. Enter Theo Faber, psychotherapist extraordinaire and flawed individual. He already has a respectable job elsewhere, but decides to transfer over to The Grove, even though it is a sinking ship, because he is obsessed with Alicia and solving the mystery behind why she murdered her husband. Along the way, we get snippets into Alicia's diary leading up to the murder, alongside of Theo's POV. I can't really give you anything more than this, because this is a novel that depends on you being fooled by the twist. You know, the big twist, the one where every blurb on the cover and every early review gives you a heads up, and perhaps that was part of the issue here for me. It seems these types of books that pull the wool over your eyes and take you by surprise are best enjoyed before anyone else has had a chance to read them. Let's come back around to the fact that I've been reading mysteries, thrillers, and suspense novels for decades, way before Gone Girl was written and these domestic dramas with tricky slight-of-hand became all the rage. If you are new-ish to the psych thriller scene, and you whole heartedly enjoyed recent novels such as The Woman In The Window, you will adore this. It was a well written, compulsive, slow burning build up to an explosive ending. Structurally, it had everything you could ask for, as it was well researched, engaging, and the perfect length of ""includes what we need without being overly winded"". Unfortunately, I've seen this particular twist done numerous times, so I was clued in fairly early to what the big twist would be, and without spoiling or giving anything away, the lay out of the narrative in the second half of the novel is what fully clued me in, because it was too neat and tidy to end any other way. I will say that I was so satisfied and pleased with the way the author chose to close out the final chapter, and regardless of being surprised by the twist or not, it was a classic wrap up that will stand the test of time over the years. I think I'm going to wrap it up here, and please don't let my 3 star rating dissuade you from giving this one a try. Michaelides is talented, and his writing is gripping and keeps you turning the pages regardless of the big twist. I would be honored to read his next novel and will most certainly look for his name in the future. In the meantime I have found so much in this novel worth discussing, from the portrayal of mental health care to the inner workings of various marriages, and think this will make a great winter book club choice for readers around the globe. *Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy via NetGalley."
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23315273-carol,Rating 1 out of 5,"Read anything else on your TBR first. Anything. Better yet, delete The Silent Patient from your TBR. If you do, you'll never know what it feels like to become aware that you could have spent that 4 - 5 hours reading a great book ... or at least a better book.... definitely a book that doesn't do a major disservice to anyone who practices in the mental health field or who lives with a mental health impairment, and maybe even a book that doesn't present misogyny on every page.The Silent Patient fails as a psychological thriller on all fronts. Its narrator lacks any credibility as a psychotherapist, as an employee, as a spouse, as a man. All characters are flat and inauthentic. The plot doesn't hang together. The solution telegraphs itself long before the ending, and still makes no sense. Michaelides wastes time on sub-plots that are irrelevant, introduces red herring characters with no subtlety so the reader is merely annoyed. Offers us a lawyer who is instantly available more than once to meet with someone he seeks not to meet., and a therapist who sees a former (long..... former, like .... years) patient at her home at 10 pm, and then risks malpractice by offering advice to him. And the writing is pedestrian, at best. Aside from its flaws as a psychological thriller, Michaelides demonstrates that he knows nothing about mental health diagnoses, treatments and indicated medications, but the biases he displays in this novel contribute to a culture of misinformation that may discourage a reader who needs treatment for therapy from getting it, and may discourage other readers from complying with a treatment plan that includes prescription medications in amounts that data shows have therapeutic benefits. The girlfriend, then wife, of the narrator, describes herself as ""crazy"" a dozen or so times, and yet this is not relevant to any sort of mental health diagnosis over the span of the novel. In a span of ten pages, he describes a character as being in ""a medicated haze"", but the med he names wouldn't cause that effect at any dosage. One psychotherapist meets with a patient 2 - 3 times and instead of evidencing any interest in the health of the patient, he primarily focuses on how her behavior might be disturbing her spouse. Another psychotherapist agrees to change a patient's prescription med mix on a whim, and overnight, without any plan for a gradual step-down or other concern for patient impact. A third character presses unidentified meds into a patient's hand and requires that she consume them in his/her presence. None of the medical professionals, save the one risking malpractice, demonstrate competency or concern for the welfare of their patients. All of the male characters running this facility repeatedly refer to all of the female patients as ""bitch;"" all of the patients in the facility are women. Every female character displays unpleasant behaviors that range in consequence from minor to severe: unfaithful, gossip-y, violent, vengeful, insecure, impulsive, annoying, tiresome, disloyal. I've written a review of this horrid novel only because I might spare a friend or two. Every time someone deletes this book from his or her TBR without reading it, an angel gets his wings."

As you will see, it’s an incredible story—of that there is no doubt. Whether you believe it or not is up to you.
Ohhhh, I see why this book is getting so much buzz: it is virtually unputdownable.I didn't actually have any plans to read The Silent Patient. I just happened to see it hanging around in the new releases, took a quick peek, and thought-- why not? Well, I'll tell you why not. You absolutely definitely should NOT read this book if you want to go to sleep and get up for real life stuff in the morning. I read this until my eyes were like ""nope"" and closed on their own.It's very compelling. A psychotherapist called Theo Faber narrates the story and he announces early on that he's pretty ""fucked up"". He worms his way into a new job at the Grove mental health facility because of his fascination with the artist Alicia Berenson, who murdered her husband in an open-and-shut case and hasn't spoken a word since.
But let us not forget that while Alicia Berenson may be a murderer, she was also an artist.
Theo finds himself connecting with Alicia and feeling a desperate need to figure out why she did it. And, what's more, he wants to figure out why she is silent. What can't she say? What won't she say? The more he digs into her life, her family, and her past, the deeper in he gets. It's a fast-paced ride with short punchy chapters (oh, how easy it is to think ""just one more chapter""). The story has so many threads and little surprises to uncover. More questions arise at every turn. And even those who work out the main aspect of the mystery will probably still enjoy the journey of finding out why, and all the little shocking discoveries made along the way.It is true that those who have read a number of twisty mysteries will likely guess the truth, but I think there's enough goodness here to make it enjoyable anyway. Or it was for me at least. Full of thrills, artistic metaphor, twists and Greek tragedy.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"

Theo Farber, a psychotherapist, has heard of Alicia over the years through the news and is delighted when a job opening becomes available that would allow him to work directly with Alicia. Will Theo get Alicia talking again? What actually happened all those years ago? Yes, this book really is as good as all of the hype. The writing on this was really top rate. Michaelides knew perfectly how to create intrigue and how to use dialogue with varying short and long paragraphs and short and long chapters to create the perfect pacing for this work. It was incredibly page turning, and the author definitely showed his chops as a mystery writer. He could write a master class in mystery writing. And this is his debut novel! What will Michaelides go from here? Personally, I can hardly wait to find out.Theo is gaining information about what happened in the past, but he is also questioning his own abilities. Can he really get Alicia talking? What are the professional boundaries of a psychotherapist? There was a little bit of internal monologue with Theo, but it wasn't boring or drawn out unnecessarily but raised some deep questions, causing the reader to think beyond just the superficial mystery/thriller. There was also some mention of art and its deeper meaning. It helped to create added depth to this book.Overall, yes, yes, and yes! This book is phenomenal if you haven't read it already!

Wow, I'm still reeling from that ending! A mindblowing, to-die for twist!
A fast read that kept me intrigued from beginning to end, although the shocker came at the end. Wait......wait......what just happened? This was how I felt as a read the last few chapters!Alicia Berenson is such a mysterious, intriguing character and I was trying to figure her out the entire novel.  I kept asking myself, ""What is up with Alicia?""She is a famous, talented painter and happily married to her husband, Gabriel. They live in London and have a cozy life.Why would Alicia murder him and then never speak again? You want to know, right? Well, I did and couldn't stop reading until I found out. It is the feeling you have when you 
just have to know why!!
The novel is narrated by Alicia's psychotherapist Theo Faber,  He is determined to ""
fix Alicia
"".  I was so invested in learning what the circumstances of Alicia's silence was and had to find out if Theo could save her.  Would she ever speak again?  READ IT NOW to find out!I wasn't going to read this one, and then requested it on NG and I'm really glad I did.  As you can tell, I really enjoyed it! Sure to be a 2019 FAVORITE !Thanks to Celadon/ NG for my arc. Book is out in Feb 2019 Review posted to blog."
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16387009-lindsay,Rating 1 out of 5,"I hated this book. The women are all tired, cliched stereotypes that often veer into misogyny. For example, Alicia’s aunt is described the first time you meet her as an ugly, old face pressed to a window, and it only gets worse after that because—of course—she’s fat. Her “grotesque” (a word actually used in the book) appearance is apparently a mirror of her evil personality. How creative! The author takes that approach over and over again: young, naturally beautiful women like Alicia and Theo’s wife are worthy of interest, while the female characters Theo can’t find attractive—because they’re ugly, old, large, fat, fake, stupid—are only worth his disdain. Beyond that, the prose was tough to get through. And don’t even get me started on the diary sections, which portray Alicia as a woman who either sits in a coffee shop for hours on end, has sex with her husband, or paints him as Jesus (no, I’m not kidding). The chapters where she couldn’t speak were almost a relief. Overall, the author just seemed more invested in getting to the the clever twist ending than in writing a full-bodied story with women who seem like, you know, actual people. Which is a pity, because that clever twist ending had potential."

I liked the final twist and ending of the book. Did my spider sense catch it? In the middle I was suspicious something was wrong but it well played and fooled me once! Shame on me!This is a successful debut novel with different writing technique. It may be sensed that the writer also works for big screen. Fast moving pace, twisty, edgy tricks, reminded me of “Gothika”, “AHS-Asylum”movies landed on Hitchcockian suspicious, dubious atmosphere! Mind games confuse the hell of you and surprises punching your face! There is a character is quite deserved my biggest slap!!! But if I speak about the identity of character, it means I have to give spoiler about murderer’s identity! Great dilemma between revealing unlikable character and getting expelled from GR community because of my big mouth! So mouth zipped. Punches secretly clenched.

Not enough conflict soon enough. Also, the motivation for why the main character wanted to switch hospitals to handle the woman. It might be explained later in the book as a reveal but for me it weakened the structure. Too much of a slow burn for me. I guess I like a book that has a thriller structure or at least closer to one. For me I need conflict on every page that pulls the reader through the text."

However, the book ended up bordering as a cheesy murder mystery, with the main character acting like a white-knight detective who would question a bunch of cartoonish side characters that just outright admit their motivations or feelings about Alicia.

“Please don’t let’s get dramatic.”
I've been a bit hesitant about writing this review since the majority of readers really enjoyed this debut. However since Goodreads allows us to express and respect our different opinions I don't see any harm in being honest. I didn't hate The Silent Patient but I did find this novel both ridiculous and incompetent. Just because The Silent Patient has a ""twist"" that doesn't mean it should be labelled as being a psychological thriller. There is little to no suspense, the mystery is laughable, the tension largely MIA. The psychology in this one is...well, the depiction of psychiatrist and psychotherapists is at best, laughable, at worst, ignorant. The book hinges completely on its ""twist"", a twist that also renders the majority of the narrative completely irrelevant. This book seems to me yet another weak attempt of jumping on the domestic thriller bandwagon.  In short: Calling this a novel seems somewhat misleading. This reads more like some sort of hackneyed script.LONG REVIEW AHEAD (
if you enjoyed this book I advise you to skip this rant-review
)The Silent Patient is a really flawed piece of work. I will try to tackle what I personally thought were the major problems this book had (and yes, this is my subjective opinion):✎ THE WRITING (idiotic dialogues + inane monologues + ham-handed metamorphoses + a complete lack of a sense of place)✖ I like Agatha Christie and she has what I would call a 'dry' style of writing. Her mysteries are heavy on dialogue. The many conversations that her characters have are witty, amusing and or entertaining. The descriptions she provides perfectly render the characters' mannerisms and surroundings. Michaelides' writing mostly consisted in a series of dialogues between two characters and it reads like a script. It would work if what they spoke like actual people rather than this:
“Perhaps I’m imagining it. But I’m sensing something… Keep an eye on it. Any aggression or competitiveness interferes with the work. You two need to work with each other, not against each other.”“But remember, with greater feeling comes greater danger.” 
The dialogues/monologues came across as being incredibly silly and they make the characters sound like children.✖ There were plenty of dramatic and over-the-top statements and or phrases that really ruined potentially significant scenes and or somber moments of contemplation: 
“Her silence was like a mirror—reflecting yourself back at you.”~“Now I saw the truth. [She] hadn’t saved me—she wasn’t capable of saving anyone. She was no heroine to be admired—just a frightened, fucked-up girl, a cheating liar. This whole mythology of us that I had built up […] now collapsed in seconds—like a house of cards in a gust of wind.” ~“How was this possible? Had she been acting the whole time? Had she ever loved me?” ~“Why did she do it? How could she?”
 Jeez, melodramatic much? ✖ Theo’s narrative was filled with painfully overdone monologues that have little purpose since they don’t make Theo into a realistic and nuanced character and most of the time they do not even further the plot. Alicia’s narrative (that is, her diary) makes no sense but more on that when I tackle her character. It’s safe to say that, given that her diary entries included things such as “It took me a moment to speak. I was so taken aback I didn’t know what to say” and “I feel joyous. I feel full of hope”, I had a hard time ‘immersing’ myself or ‘buying’ into her narrative. Since this book is a ‘domestic thriller’ both Theo and Alicia don’t have sex they ‘fuck’. Because writing ‘we fucked’ makes the story gritty and ‘dark’ [insert laughter here].✖ The Greek ‘connection’. Done properly, I usually love it when contemporary books draw parallels from Greek myths and or classics. Done properly. Comparing people to Greek statues and having your main characters referring to themselves as being a ‘Greek hero/heroine’ is the opposite of subtle:
“She was a statue; a Greek goddess come to life in my hands.” ~ “He looked like a Greek statue” ~ “the actress playing Alcestis looked like a Greek statue” ~ “my fate was already decided—like in a Greek tragedy” ~ “Casting herself as a tragic heroine”.
 We have Diomedes who comes from “a long line of Greek shepherds” (and tells Theo that “every Greek knows his tragedies”). And finally we have Alicia’s painting which is entitled Alcestis. Both the painting and Euripides play had potential. They would have been enough. We didn’t need the constant reminder that The Silent Patient wants to be a ‘tragic play’. Like many other things in this book, the blatant symbolism managed to ruin a potentially good analogy. ✖ These characters do not sound British. They talk like Americans (or what Americans sound like in a CSI episode). There are no British cultural references and or British expressions. This book could be set anywhere. ✖ The story is set supposedly in the UK. But really, there is 0 sense of place. Who cares about giving your characters a backdrop? Why bother rendering a neighbourhood or an area of London? Who gives a fork about what a room or place looks like? Let's remember: this story could be set anywhere (or nowhere given how realistic it is).✖ You could say that the focus on dialogues and flat scenery are reminiscent of a play...which is fine but it doesn’t come across as such. This book just reminds me of a ‘B-movie’ script. There is no tragedy, no pathos , no wit.  A 2nd grade play is closer to a 'classic' play than this book is.✖ There is this attempt to make the two ‘main’ women ethereal which did provides a few laughs:
“Her white dress glowed ghostlike in the torchlight” ~ “I remember so much white everywhere: […] the white of her eyes, her teeth, her skin. I’d never known that skin could be so luminous, so translucent ; ivory white with occasional blue veins visible just beneath the surface, like threads of color in white marble. She was a statue.” ~ “strands of long red hair falling across bony shoulders, blue veins beneath the translucent skin”. 
✎ THE CHARACTERS ✖ Theo. Our wannabe  Tom Ripley . Within a few pages we know that he is obsessed with Alicia (which makes him incredibly unprofessional) and he for the most part he is just soooo dull and whiny. He moans about his childhood,  and his wife, Kathy, who is cheating on him because she is a beautiful actress so...that's what they do, isn't it?, and his attempt(s) to self-fashion himself as some sort of tragic hero fail epically. After  the big reveal...well. His character makes even less forking sense. He stalked Alicia before breaking into her house. He must have known learnt about her, or made same 2+2 type of reasoning upon learning of her arrest. And he must have realised why she kept silent, especially after he reads Alcestis. This guy is soooo thick. His dramatic monologues, constant whinging, and complete lack of awareness (I've said it before this man is thick) made him into a really unbelievable character.✖ Alicia...she is beautiful. She loves having sex with her husband and painting. That’s about it. We are told that she was ‘charming’...but how can she have gained this reputation since she has 0 friends and her only real relationship is the one she has with Gabriel (her partner or whatever). Jean-Felix is the owner of a gallery but they don’t spend time together or are on friendly terms. Who is she charming to? She is a complete recluse! She lives in London and is good enough painter and yet...she has managed to make 0 connections. Her diary entries make her sound at best guileless and at worst like a demented child. Her character is just an object. She is there to look beautiful and tragic. She has a few basic reactions (she just “looks up” or “looks down”) or she does the good ol’ ‘banshee’ act, flinging herself in a sudden ‘rage’ towards Theo or another patient. Wow. Such a deep and complex portrait of a  betrayed and traumatised woman.✖ The cast of characters consists in cardboard cutouts. Going back to Christie, sometimes exaggerated character can be entertaining. Especially if they are a parodying a certain type of person (the writer, the artist, the gossipy old lady and so forth). Here we have mere ‘sketches’ of people. We have Christian, who doesn’t like Theo because he is a massive bellend bully: “Christian glared at me.” “Christian looked irritated.” “Christian rolled his eyes at me.” “Christian laughed that annoying laugh of his.” We have Professor Diomedes who is Greek and is “an unorthodox man’ ...that’s it folks. That’s his character. Also,  I cannot seriously believe that he was so unprofessional and blind about Theo (and his flagrant obsession with Alicia). Yuri is another pointless and unbelievable addition to the story. He is the head psychiatric nurse and comes from Latvia so he obviously has to be weird about women. Makes perfect sense. Then we have Stephanie who has very little page time or importance Theo having never even know of her existence knows immediately, before she even speaks, that she is Caribbean). We also have the “jolly Caribbean dinner ladies” (who, surprise surprise, are only mentioned once). We have a few ‘ugly’ characters who are either ‘mad’ and or violent (Elif, a ‘massive’ Turkish woman, who spends her time shouting or grunting because she is a patient and that’s how ‘ugly’ and mentally ill people behave. Lydia, Alicia’s mean aunt. She is grotesquely ‘fat’ and has lots of cats. She basically just glares, scorns, and spits at people). Paul, Alicia’s cousin, still lives with his mother so he looks like ‘virgin’ and in spite his size he seems ‘stunted’. Kathy and Gabriel are the antithesis of credible  (actors and fashion photographers manage to be self-engrossed and 1 dimensional). We have Gabriel’s brother...who is the typical chip-on-my-shoulder character (he has acne, he is balding, he is just a ‘lawyer’, boohoo). Jean-Felix owns a gallery so he is the embodiment of some sort of art-vampire.✎ THE NONSENSICAL PLOT✖ Nothing much happens. It’s quite clear that the words that exist before the ‘twist’ serve as filler. Theo moans about this and that. That's about 70% of the novel. ✖ There are a series of stupid things happening for no apparent reason.  such as Paul hitting Theo with a bat. WHY. ✖ The Grove is not a forensic unit. I am sure that Theo should be doing a bit of paperwork to cover his 1 to 1s with Alicia. And everything that happens in the Grove is extremely unlikely. Rules, guidelines, procedures are flung out of the window. ✖ The ‘big twist’  is predictable. We know Theo is unreliable. All of his actions towards Alicia, his research and his ‘interviews’ make no bloody sense. He already knows about her! And unless he is incredibly thick, he should do 2+2 and figure out why she isn’t talking. The twist makes his motivations and approach to Alicia completely pointless. Theo hadn’t forgotten what he’d done, and his narrative isn’t in the format of a diary, where he would be deliberately lying and omitting certain things. Why not make this novel into more of a confessional? Or more in the vein of The Talented Mr. Ripley, You, Lolita, or even Gentlemen and Players, where we know early on what he has done and we wonder if he will be caught or if he will done something worse. IN CONCLUSION The Silent Patient might not be the worst novel I’ve read but it’s a badly written, poorly developed book. Worse still, The Silent Patient comes across as being both pointless and passionless. A ‘twist’ needs—demands—a story. I want to read characters who vaguely resemble or talk like real people. If you want to play with stereotypes (a la Christie) don't make your characters take themselves so seriously. A parody of a certain 'personality' should at least be funny and or amusing. Adding a strong setting and a coherent storyline wouldn’t do any harm either. Overall: The Silent Patient is a messy, flat, painfully dull, 'Hollywood-type' of book.

This book is the very definition of a page-turner. From the very first page I was seduced by the magnetic writing style of Alex Michaelides.Nothing is as it seems in this novel. This story is complex and multi-layered with a labyrinth of characters, each playing their part in the development of the plot.The author never once tries to lead you astray with erroneous clues in an attempt to distract you from an obvious conclusion. I never once felt like I had a grasp on how this story was going to play out, which kept me rapt until the last page.The blurb on the back cover says that the book has already been optioned for a movie and I'd like to put forth my recommendations for casting:Haley Bennett as AliciaandOliver Jackson Cohen as Theo (I expect a casting credit)I received an ARC copy of this book from the publisher.

19,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16958299-dr-appu-sasidharan-dasfill,Rating 1 out of 5,"(Throwback review) Isn't it strange that we immensely love and hate a book at the same time? Many of you might have had such an experience at least once in your lifetime. Well, this book was the one which gave me that feeling.  First of all, let me start with what I liked in this book. The writing style of the author is suited for writing a thriller like this. He succeeded in making me glued to the book even after the glaring innuendos that were disparaging to the core kept me exasperated. He worked out the plot twist well. This might be the reason why almost every friend of mine in Goodreads love this book. I must confess now itself that if I was not a Doctor and I didn't know how the healthcare system works, I would also have given this book four or five stars. This is a book which won the best book in the thriller section in Goodreads award last year. If you are promoting a book as a psychological thriller, there are two things which the author should be careful about. One is to get the thriller aspect correct, which the author had succeeded, and the second is to get the Psychological aspect right, which is where the aberration lies here. The author had unabashedly mentioned some things about Psychotherapy in which some are true in some rare cases while some have unfortunately gone entirely wrong. The author has no right to generalise about the health sector as a whole based on some scrupulous activities done by some individuals. You can't even see such a shady Psychiatric institution in any dystopian world. Mr Michaelides, who is a Cambridge product, had an excellent opportunity to produce one of the best thrillers. Unfortunately, he didn't do the adequate research in the psychological aspects needed for this book.   There are many mistakes regarding psychotherapy, treatment methods, various disorders, therapy sessions, medical ethics in this book. Initially, Theo, who happens to be a psychotherapist, is strangely saying that his father had a personality disorder which he is mentioning as an illness that went untreated for the duration of his life, which is, in fact, rather absurd. There is no definitive treatment or drug for the management of personality disorders. The only way in which we can manage it is by behavioural modification therapies like the DBT (Dialectical behavioural therapy) and CBT (Cognitive behavioural therapy). I am sharing four pictures here for my friends who are utterly perplexed due to being thrown into the crazy world of complicated medical jargon by the author in this novel bolt out of the blue.

 

 The author should have done more research on topics like the transference, countertransference, Borderline personality disorder, Narcissistic personality disorder before writing this book. 



 I remember having an entrancing discussion about this book with one of my friends who is a Psychiatrist in D.C. We concluded that we should not be pedantic about it and leave it alone as just another painfully didactic fiction which came in the disguise of a psychological thriller.  It is poignant to see Entertainment Weekly calling it ""an unforgettable — and Hollywood-bound — new thriller"" with ""a mix of Hitchcockian suspense, Agatha Christie plotting, and Greek tragedy."" I heard that the silver screen version of this book is in the pipeline. I humbly request Mr Michaelides, who also happens to be a screenwriter to correct all the flaws in the novel in the upcoming movie. I had the expectations of being enraptured by this book before reading it. But unfortunately, I abhorred this book to such an extent that I curtailed from reading other thrillers for some time. All the other thrillers I might read after this one will be desultory attempts. I am sure that I will recover from this one. I am sad that Alex Michaelides missed a golden opportunity to create a masterpiece."

Alicia gives no explanation and refuses to speak. She’s admitted to a psychiatric unit, ‘The Grove’ in North London, and six years later she still hasn’t spoken - not one single word! Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has always been obsessed with Alicia’s story, and when a position presents itself at The Grove for someone with his qualifications, he applies for the job and is successful. Theo is certain that he can get her to talk, even though others have tried and failed. Although Alicia is silent, the narrative speaks to us in a way that she can’t or won’t, throwing the spotlight on the minutiae of her life as a talented artist, and ultimately what led to the events of that fateful night. Theo’s own personal life is laid bare too, and he’s also a very complex character - indeed not unlike Alicia. If Theo’s attempts to encourage Alicia to speak are successful, will it be something he wants to hear? Because beneath Alicia’s silent exterior, she has plenty to say!Clever, and compelling, with a humdinger of a twist- I hope the ‘Silent’ Patient ‘speaks’ to you too!"

But real love is very quiet, very still. It's boring, if seen from the perspective of high drama. Love is deep and calm - and constant.”HOLY SHIT! Wasn't this a mothefucking page turner? Like I literally read and listened to this in 2 home sittings, and 2 subway sittings. Holy motherfuck! I knew this Greek author could do it! #proudtobegreek. Honestly, all the Greek mentions in this book were porn to me. He wove a whole story so beautifully based on a Greek tragedy, it's wonderful. Anyone who is Greek in here, read this book. Love me some nice representation!This book was split into two sections: 1: Theo's point of view2: Alicia's point of viewTheo's point of view is split into two categories... him talking about himself and his wife and him talking about Alicia and himselfAlicia's point of view is seen through her diaryI found myself not as interested in Theo's chapters about his wife as I was in the entirety of the book. I knew it is the kind of story where this part would actually mean something to the main plot and not just to show us aspects about Theo's life and his personality, but they were the least interesting chapters for me nonetheless. Apart from that, the book itself was extremely fast paced, deep and exhilarating. I just couldn't for the life of me, stop turning the pages. You all know your girl lost sleep for this. Yes, I motherfucking did.Was the twist good and unexpected? Yes. Did you have to suspend your disbelief a bit to make it work in your head? Yes. Was it amazing nonetheless? Yes. Listen, it was a really great twist but if Theo had told us from the beginning, it would lose the momentum. So it's a twist based on a character not telling us something he already knew. I find that a tiny bit weak. But it worked with the story and I fucking loved it ok? Overall, I loved this book so much. In this review I talked about the two reasons I didn't give this book 5 stars but don't let it fool you. This is one of the best books I have read this year and it will probably remain in this position once the year ends. It is full of intrigue, interesting characters and dynamics and a very fresh story. Trust me and pick it up. K bye now!"

Very little is really the way it seems in this addictive psychological thriller and it had me on the edge of my seat from the first chapter. I had so many questions about what was happening and what had happened with both Alicia and Theo. Theo is so ready to lie, manipulate, and use people and even though Alicia was the murderer, think I felt more danger from Theo and his shady practices.

25,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16912659-dorie---cats-books,Rating 3 out of 5,"***NOW AVAILABLE***Well looks like I’m the outlier on this book as I have been reading many glowing 5 star reviews. Maybe I’ve been reading too many thrillers lately. For me to love a thriller all of the characters have to be well developed and intricate to the story, the plot has to be a good one and have more to offer than just the “thrill”, or wow factor at the end of the book. I found the characters to be shallow and the plot seemed to run off in several directions throughout the course of the novel. I should add that a 3* from me means that the book was just an o.k. read for me, not bad but not great enough that I will be thinking of it long after I’ve finished or be recommending it to my friends. Still worth a read :)One thing proved true, this book did have me turning the pages quickly to find out what would happen at the end. However while I was turning these pages quickly, I wasn’t really getting very much out of the story. I felt as though the fact that she wouldn’t speak was the main focus of the book rather than looking into whether she was really guilty or not. I know that she had been tried and found guilty but I had hoped that perhaps the doctors would find other issues worth pursuing regarding her guilt or innocence.There are multiple characters introduced but none of them are really very well described. Dr. Diomedes is the head of the facility and he appoints a new doctor, Theo Faber, who has recently joined the staff to oversee Alicia’s care. She had previously been under the care of another physician but he hadn’t made any progress with her and so it is hoped that this new doctor will help to make her finally speak.The book is narrated by Theo and then later by Alicia as we begin to read her previously hidden diary. The book takes place in “The Grove” a private facility for psychiatric patients. Theo Faber transferred from another facility because he is obsessed with Alicia’s case. We do get to know him through his thoughts about his own marriage to Karen who seems increasingly “busy” and coming home late from rehearsals, she is an actress. This is a storyline that is introduced and somewhat developed and then just left hanging. What really is going on with Theo’s marriage? He seems to be spending all of his time at the facility with Alicia. SPOILER ALERT***Alicia had been a successful artist and Gabriel a photographer of some repute. There really is never any answer to the question of “why”, why would Alicia kill Gabriel. There doesn’t seem to be any evidence that they were unhappy or that Gabriel was unfaithful, there doesn’t seem to have been much research as to why she would kill her husband. She was convicted because she was found at the scene with the gun in her hand, covered in blood because she had slit her wrists in an attempt to kill herself. The twist is a good one but doesn’t come until the last 20 pages or so. I had pretty much figured it out by then but I’m sure it will come as a surprise to many. I would say read it without reading lots of reviews, decide for yourself if it is indeed “the debut novel of the year for 2019” as the publisher has written in the blurb for the book! After the last session that Theo had with Alicia he is writing everything down while it was still fresh in his mind and he states ""As you will see, it's an incredible story--of that there is no doubt. Whether you believe it or not is up to you.""I received a copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley."
26,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides is a 2019 Celadon Books publication. When this book first started to garner a little buzz, I initially shied away from it. I am still avoiding psychological thrillers for the most part. However, the reviews were so overwhelmingly positive I relented, adding it to my TBR list. After a lengthy wait at the library, I finally obtained a copy, and dived in with no small amount of cautious optimism. Was it worth the wait? Did it live up to the hype?The set- up is instantly intriguing-Theo Faber, a criminal psychotherapist is oddly obsessed with the well- respected artist, Alicia Berenson, a patient housed in a forensic unit after shooting her husband five times in the face. She hasn’t uttered a word since. Theo sacrifices better and more lucrative opportunities in hopes of becoming her therapist. As he manipulates his way into Alicia’s life, his determination to unlock the secrets of her heart and mind slowly yields a few surprising results. However, all his probing could have a few unforeseen consequences...Anyone who has read a review for this book has, by now, heard about the stunning twist that apparently caught most readers off guard. But, let’s not get too hung up on the twist. In my humble opinion, a mind -blowing twist is a requirement of any and all psychological thrillers. What makes a twist work in the first place is the mystery. Did Alicia kill her husband, as all the evidence suggests? If so, what was her motive? Why hasn’t she uttered a single word in all these years? This is a compelling mystery. Alicia an enigma, to be sure. This is unsettling enough on its own merits.  However, the author also examines some hard truths about institutions that rely on funding, which leads to money and power taking precedent over the welfare and health of the patients. Adding in yet another rich layer is the unique and quite interesting mythological parallel woven into the story.  It is easy to step into Theo’s narrative as he slowly walks us through Alicia’s past, dropping hints and clues along the way, introducing us to all the possible suspects, while delving into Alicia’s fragile psyche. But, if I am being totally honest, the plot is not all that plausible, and at times the execution warbles. There are some problems within the story, but in my humble opinion, this is how a pure psychological thriller should be presented. The author relies on paranoia and the emotional instability of the characters to build suspense as opposed to grisly, graphic crime scenes. It’s a mind game from start to finish. Now, about that twist-The most important thing to me was that it was singular. No over the top, unnecessary twists added for mere shock value. A good PT doesn’t need more than one, maybe two, depending on the author’s experience or the situation- in my opinion. In this case, the reader is totally blindsided, tapped on the shoulder from behind, by a revelation so shocking, I’ll bet some of you gasped out loud. I know I did! It messed with your head, right? Now THAT’S what I’m talking about!! Of course, after all that buildup and the success of the big plot twist, the ending had to come together, or all was for naught. I was a little concerned for a few minutes, but honestly, the conclusion was the cherry on the cake. The book was worth waiting for, but I am glad I proceeded with caution and kept my expectations in check. The story is not quite strong enough to merit a five -star rating, but I appreciated the pure, traditional understated approach. The author wisely dialed things back, distancing himself from the oversaturated parodies many current psychological thrillers have become. I hope the popularity of this book with inspire more authors to follow this more authentic prototype and restore the psychological thriller back to its former glory. "

I did think it was a decent thriller and I can tell why many rate it high. But, it is also easy for me to tell why someone would rate it low. I am just going to hang out pretty close to the middleThe best part of this book was definitely the resolution. The build up to it was okay, but not all that suspenseful to me. There were a few big moments throughout the book, but it was mainly just exposition. Also, I figured out the ""mystery"" early on. This is not me tooting my own horn like I am an amazing detective. It was more like I stumbled on it by accident. About 1/3 to 1/2 of the way in I thought,""wouldn't it be interesting if . . ."" and that is exactly what happened!The characters were kind of flat to me. I think part of my opinion on them is tainted by the fact that I just finished another thriller, The Whisper Man. In that one, the characters are much more dynamic and the relationships are much more interesting. Despite some twisting and turning, the relationships here are plain vanilla and a bit predictable.I will stress again, especially because I know that many are rating this one highly, that my criticisms above are just little things that I felt and I know for certain that others won't feel at all. So, don't read my review and go in thinking it is going to rate middle of the road for you, too. You might be one who really gets into it!Basically, an entertaining thriller. Not too deep. The perfect book for a quick escape. Easy to read and follow the twists and turns. Solid, but not really exceptional."

This is a contemporary story steeped in a deliciously gothic tone. At the beginning of the book, we have a vicious murder, a frightening asylum setting for the criminally insane, and a suspect who refuses to speak. When Theo steps in to save the day as psychotherapist to the silent Alice, well….you are in for a twisted treat, so I can’t divulge anymore!I went into this book with expectations it would be similar to Alice Feeney’s Sometimes I Lie or one of my old favorites Before I Go to Sleep. I was wrong, it is so much better! The main characters of Theo and Alice are richly layered with just enough reveals leaked out over time that you will constantly wonder “who is the unreliable narrator here?” (You will doubt yourself over and over and I LOVE THAT!!!). Truly, one of the best books I’ve read this year! I absolutely devoured it. Theo takes you into his head, explaining the psychology involved in certain situations, as if the reader is part conspirator, part solution. There are Freudian quotes sprinkled liberally throughout this mystery--pure delight for armchair psychologists!I listened to the Audible version--Outstanding!"
31,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41321285-ltj,Rating 5 out of 5,"“The Silent Patient” by Alex Michaelides is a book I’ve been recommended to read for a while now. I’ve heard of this insanely popular novel and finally decided to read it to see what the hype was about thanks to a good friend who said I’d more than likely love it (thanks LB!). My friend was 100 percent right, I actually ended up loving it. Before I begin my review, I wanted to let you all know about some trigger warnings.There are events and situations in this novel that deals with self-harm, attempted suicide, domestic abuse, and child abuse. Moving along now, the intro to “The Silent Patient” immediately had me hooked. This was the first book I’ve ever read by Michaelides and let me say, I truly love his style of writing. It’s fantastic and with short chapters on top of fast-paced writing, this was a genuine page-turner.This novel is so addictive, I stayed up late a few nights reading because this book was that suspenseful and thrilling. From the chapters including diary excerpts written by my favorite character Alicia to the entire mystery aspect of this novel, it checked all the boxes for me. I loved all the characters as they were fully fleshed out and added a nice layer of mystery as I had no idea where things would eventually go as the story continued.Speaking of Alicia, I especially loved her character the most as everything involving her had me beyond intrigued as to the reasoning behind why she was silent and just everything that transpired. Besides the awesome characters, great world-building, and all the psychotherapy aspects of it all, this novel was absolutely incredible. I could not put it down due to such a gripping story and how I personally related to it.Without getting into many details, this was definitely an emotional read for me with many concepts I related to big time that I personally dealt with as a child. It struck a chord with me and made me even more connected to the story when it came to the events involving child abuse by terrible parents and how it relates to the mental state of people that deal with it on a daily basis.Luckily, I turned out okay but my goodness, I totally related to those situations as they happened to characters. Don’t worry, I won’t spoil anything for you but this book has some amazing plot twists with the ending being one I will never, ever forget.Oh yes, ladies and gentlemen, “The Silent Patient” has one of the best plot twists for an ending I have ever read in a novel. Ever. It was so good, I had to re-read it a few times because it completely and utterly blew me away. I’m talking jaw on the floor, freaking out, going delirious. Asking myself what exactly I had just read because OMG, that was brilliant. Incredible. Unforgettable. Unbelievable. Wow.I give “The Silent Patient” by Alex Michaelides a perfect 5/5 and I will recommend this novel to every single reader I meet for the rest of my life. From an incredible cast of characters, excellent writing, Greek mythological references, and so much more, this is perfection. I loved all the suspense, mystery, and how there was no fluff at all in this novel. It hits you hard, doesn’t let go, and once you get to the ending, I guarantee you that you’ll be floored. THAT. WAS. CRAZY.Seriously, go read this. Go check it out at your local library tomorrow. Buy it on Amazon tonight. Whatever you need to do, this is an experience you need to enjoy at least once in your life if you love a great thriller with a mind-blowing ending. Once this novel is in your possession, make a hot cup of coffee or tea, lock yourself in a room, and enjoy reading this masterpiece."

Instead I'll just call it awful, truly and in all ways, from its portrayal of mental illness, to its utter lack of believability, to its stupid, stupid, stupid characters. One of whom gets an eyeball gouged out and I almost feel like doing the same to myself for having read this thing from start to stupid finish.The story takes place in a mental institution, where most of the psychiatric professionals are presumably tweens and teens. Patients are permitted to wander at will carrying items such as broken cue sticks, which I would think might be a bit jagged and sharp and therefore potentially quite dangerous, but, what do I know. Theo, the main character-slash-psychotherapist, gets a job at this facility and on his very first day he decides which patient he'd like to treat. He is not only permitted to treat his choice of patient -- he is also, conveniently, given no other duties aside from trying to get this SILENT PATIENT to speak. She has been silent for years, ever since murdering her husband, but no one else bothers with her anymore because most of the rest of the staff think she's a ""bitch."" Theo, is a true flash of psychiatric brilliance, decides said patient should be on less medication. He thinks maybe her aggressively drugged stupor is preventing her from talking. Really it's a wonder none of the other doctors thought of this. In any case, his boss naturally agrees right away. I am sure that in real mental health facilities this is exactly how it goes. At one point, Theo discovers that one of the staff has been selling opoids to patients. His immediate thought: ""I wondered what else he was up to—perhaps I had been a little too hasty to defend him so determinedly to Stephanie. I’d better keep an eye on him."" YES, Theo, definitely KEEP AN EYE ON HIM. Jesus.In the meantime, Theo decides to harass his patient's family and friends to see if they might provide clues as to why she won't talk. There is a dramatic scene in which a cousin takes Theo up onto a roof. For no reason. ""This is where we were when we heard her father say the thing he said to make her crazy for the rest of her life,"" or some such nonsense. AHA, it's all coming together now!As to why Alicia, the patient, won't talk? Well, she'd just been held captive by a masked man for hours, and when her husband arrived home he suggested that the masked man kill her instead of him, most likely because he didn't realize he was in a novel and that such husbands in modern fiction do stand a good chance of being murdered by their fictional wives. For whatever reason, at that point the masked man decided he'd had enough for one day and left, killing neither of the two. And then Alicia, presumably perturbed at her husband's less-than-chivalrous behavior, shot him five times in the face. And apparently after all that, she simply had nothing to say. That is really the reason.*Thanks universe that this was a library book and not an actual purchase*"

34,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5032725-debra,Rating 4 out of 5,"Teetering between a 4 and a 4.5Alicia Berenson is a famous painter who has been admitted to the Grove, a forensic unit in North London. She has been charged with murdering her husband, Graham, who is a fashion photographer, after he returns home late one evening. After shooting Graham, Alicia has never spoken again.Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who accepted a job at the Grove in the hopes of working with Alicia. He is obsessed with learning her motive. He knows he can get her to talk. Others have tried - others have failed. Will he be successful?Although Alicia does not speak, the reader gets a glimpse into her life through Theo's discussions with those in her life. Well, more to the point, we get their impressions of her, things they know about her and their own assumptions about her. They seem to have no problem sharing what they know about her but why hasn't anyone been to visit her? The reader gets to learn even more about Alicia through her diary entries. Finally, Alicia ""speaks"" via the written word. But what could have led her to shoot her husband? Will she ever speak? Why isn't she speaking now? Is it by choice? Is it due to trauma? hmmmm Theo is also an interesting character. Most of the novel is told through him. The reader also gets a glimpse into his life, his thoughts and the inner workings of his mind. I was curious as to why he was so obsessed with learning her motive. Why is he so driven to learn the truth? Is he a fan or her artwork? Will learning the truth advance his career? This is a very clever tale which grabbed my attention right away. I was intrigued to learn what was going on. I had several theories and assumptions. Some were close and some were way off base - as in a mile off base. Of course, there is that shocking reveal - I did not see that coming - AT ALL. It really was the perfect ""OMG, what did I just read?"" moment followed by an ""Aha!"" moment. This book was a page turner for me. I kept turning the pages to learn how the book was going to unfold. The ending felt a little bit rushed and I wanted to just a tad bit more. Overall, a very enjoyable read even thought one character really annoyed me.

We’re terrified of each other. I’m terrified of myself.”  This was a wild ride!I’d been looking forward to this thriller for absolutely ages – and it was definitely worth the wait in my opinion.Theo is a psychotherapist, recently moved to a new institution as he is fascinated by the woman referred to as The Silent Patient.Alicia shot her husband in the face five times, then proceeded to try and take her own life. Since being convicted she hasn’t uttered a single word, and she has been committed.Theo takes it upon himself to get Alicia to talk; to find out why she did what she did. What was going through her mind at the time?I was gripped – there are so many unlikable characters, it is hard to trust anyone. We also have chapters regarding Theo’s home life, his traumatising childhood – which led him to work in mental health, and also his relationship with his wife Kathy. “We often mistake love for fireworks - for drama and dysfunction. But real love is very quiet, very still. It’s boring, if seen from the perspective of high drama. Love is deep and calm - and constant.” I enjoyed the ending – I didn’t see that coming and it felt believable yet surprising. Although after I spoke through it with my mum I did realise that it is slightly far-fetched – but hey, I still found it entertaining which is the main point.  So it turns out Theo’s wife Kathy was cheating on him with Alicia’s husband Gabriel – what a small world eh? And Theo follows Gabriel home, ties up both him and Alicia and tells Gabriel he will either kill him or kill Alicia – he can choose. Gabriel chooses to save himself. Theo shoots the ceiling then leaves and Alicia shoots Gabriel in the face. That was all understandable, Alicia is very unstable at this time. What I found less understandable is when Theo begins working at the institution and meets Alicia for the second time. She recognises him (though we don’t know this until the end), and Theo decides that to protect himself Alicia needs to die. So he injects her with a lethal amount of morphine. I don’t get this though… why kill her? She wasn’t speaking anyway until Theo starting having sessions with her – he could have avoided it all….to me it just seemed all rather odd. Nonetheless, it was an entertaining and exciting read and I’d recommend it to anyone looking for a fast paced thriller. “Love that doesn’t include honesty doesn’t deserve to be called love.” "
36,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24156068-christina-loeffler,Rating 5 out of 5,"5, the debut of the century stars!!!Full review along with a Curry Chicken recipe featured on my blog Recipe & a Read!So first off, can I get a “hell yeah” for Alex Michaelides for this stunning debut of a novel! I ordered this on a whim on Amazon because I didn’t want to wait through the 86 holds at my library and when it came in the mail I decided just to take one little peak. However, what actually happened, was me zooming through this thrill ride at break-neck speed and finishing it in less than 12 hours (I had to sleep ok). So needless to say, I quite loved this book.Alicia Berenson was thirty-three years old when she killed her husband.Alicia and her husband Gabriel are the *perfect* couple. Alicia is an up and coming painter and Gabriel is a noted fashion photographer. They’re young, they’re beautiful and they’re head over heels in love with one another. However, as with all thrillers that quickly comes crumbling to the ground when Alicia is found standing over her dead husbands body – after being shot in the face six times – and covered in both of their blood.As everyone around Alicia grapples with this terrifying series of events and struggle to come up with a defense not just to save Alicia’s life but to understand how this could’ve happened they're met with a brick wall. Only, that brick wall is Alicia and she’s refusing to say a word. Alicia sits idly by in the court room as she is vilified and damned for killing the only man she’s ever truly loved and still, she says nothing. As she’s saved from the death penalty and instead put in a psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane, still she doesn’t say a word. Years and years go by, and still Alicia doesn’t say a word.“We’ve talked about this before. Haven’t we?”“About fireworks?”“About love. About how we often mistake love for fireworks – for drama and dysfunction. But, real love is very quiet, very still. It’s boring, if seen from a perspective of high drama. Love is deep and calm – and constant.” *can I get an AMEN*Theo Farber is a criminal psychotherapist and he’s been following Alicia’s story since the beginning. Coming from a painful upbringing and life himself, Theo see’s parts of him in Alicia and he believes, no he knows that he can help Alicia heal. As he carefully but steadily dismantles his promising career and life in order to get a job at The Grove, where Alicia is being housed he moves his pieces about the chess board of life and gets closer and closer to Alicia hoping to uncover her story and get her to tell what happened between her and Gabriel once and for all.As it turns out, Alicia feels a draw to Theo as well. At a slow, but not tedious and incredibly suspenseful pace, Alicia begins to open up and little bits and pieces of her story are falling out left for the reader and Theo to put together. What follows is easily one of the most suspenseful, exciting, thrilling and surprising stories I’ve read in quite a long time.At the time I didn’t understand. But that’s how therapy works. A patient delegates his unacceptable feelings to his therapist; and she holds everything he is afraid to feel, and she feels it for him. Then, ever so slowly, she feeds his feelings back to him. So first things first, as someone who has an undergraduate degree in Psychology (which means next to nothing in the field) but who has also been a major advocate and participant in therapy I loved the way it was portrayed in this book. Something that irks me to no end is the way the entertainment industry portrays not just people who attend therapy but therapists themselves. The whole “and how does that make you feel” line really annoys the crap out of me because that’s not what therapy is about. I think Michaelides honored the profession and despite being a pretty intense thriller and how easily it could’ve been done, therapy was never vilified but admired.So onto the meat of this story – what initially drew me in was the synopsis of Alicia killing her husband and then never speaking another word. I can’t quite explain why exactly that particular linchpin got me hook, line and sinker but it did. However, what gripped and held me and didn’t let me go from the moment I started it was an incredibly well paced story. Michaelides delivered a stunning and gripping plot, but what made it shine is that every piece of information the reader is given is given to you only exactly when it is needed to move the story forward. Nothing is sensationalized or used to provide cheap jump scare thrills. There’s a sinister undertone throughout the book and to me, The Silent Patient is the prime-o example of what the genre of psychological thriller is supposed to be.Her silence was like a mirror – reflecting yourself back at you.And it was often an ugly sight.I don’t want to give to much away because again, this is one of the most surprised I’ve been in a long time by the final twists in a thriller book. I’ve been interested in reading this for quite some time, and I’m so happy I picked it up sooner rather than later. I guarantee this is going to be one of the top books of 2019 and if it’s on your list – pick it up, if it’s not – add it now. The prose, the pacing, the suspense and development into the story were all a complete slam dunk for me. This is absolutely the type of book that once you pick it up, you’re not going to be able to put it down until you’re done with it and know how it ends – and the ending, is quite the doozie. I’m thrilled by Alex Michaelides and really excited to see future works because this author knows how to get it done my dudes."

Both narrators were brilliant! The audio might have actually enhanced this novel! The narration was that good! Would make a good first listen. Both narrators made it very easy to follow.Highly recommended!
38,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb,Rating 4 out of 5,"Once I picked this book up, I couldn’t stop and finished it in two sittings. I was intrigued right from the start and found it to be quite the page-turner. Theo is a psychotherapist who has issues of his own (don’t they all?) but he finagles his way into a job at a psychiatric facility so he can work with Alicia, a patient who was found guilty some years earlier of killing her husband, Gabriel, by shooting him in the face 5 times.  She has not spoken a word in the years since the murder and Theo is convinced he can help her. I’m not going to go into details of the plot as it’s best discovered by the reader. But, what follows is a twisty tale that took me by surprise. Sometimes an ending or twist comes out of nowhere, without warning. But, the author gave us all the clues, I had just failed to put them all together. And that is my favorite kind of mystery book. There were no rabbits pulled from a hat and no twists just for the sake of shocking the reader. In the end, I found myself smiling and thinking ""well-done"".  Is it perfect? No. Are there a few plot holes? Yes. Did I have to suspend some disbelief? Yes. Did the author tend to over explain things at times when we can figure it out on our own? Yes. Did I care? No. For a fun quick and addictive read, this fit the bill quite nicely. This is a fantastic debut and I can’t wait to see how he develops as an author. I’ll be sure to read his next book. This book will make a terrific movie if Hollywood does it right.  This was another great buddy read with my friend Marialyce!"
39,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,Rating 3 out of 5,"As a psychotherapist, Theo Faber thought it was obvious that Alicia Berenson had suffered a severe trauma surrounding her husband, Gabriel’s death. “Alicia joined the ranks of other briefly famous murders; faces we remember, but whose names we forget”. NOT Theo Faber!! He ‘never’ forgot - even though nearly six years have gone by.Alicia was admitted to a mental institution- rather than prison - even though all evidence pointed to her killing her husband. Characters were under-developed and flat.At the beginning of the story, we learn Theo was drawn to psychology to heal himself. We shall see! Theo is also ‘very’ interested in working with Alicia....( of course)...which he does. Alicia has been silent since the night of her husband’s murder. Want to know why Alicia never talked? Why she stayed completely speechless for six years? It’s not all that interesting - honest! Needed much more pulp to make her story juicy! I thought this entire novel was silly - Rather than nitpick the flaws - and let my critical mind blabber on- Mostly...this novel was lacking in *joy*.It wasn’t satire...simply doltish!!!I didn’t know how the book was ‘exactly’ going to end - but it was clear for me early on who the real troubled silent patient was. Very quick read! 2.5 stars - rating up - being a debut that has somehow managed to draw major buzz royalty! Kudos to Alex Michaelides... good karmadebut-hit!"
40,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10171516-jessica,Rating 4 out of 5,"recently, ive realised that i feel quite jaded when it comes to mysteries/thrillers. they have started to lose their ability to truly shock and surprise me; and im not sure if thats because the more you read them, the more aware and better you are at picking up subtle hints as a reader. but its starting to require a really unexpected twist to make a thriller/mystery memorable for me. and thankfully i found that in ‘the silent patient.’i really enjoy how this story weaves together theo fabers work with the famous murderss, alicia berenson, with his home life and his wife. it makes for a really dynamic and intriguing story. and like i said, there is a twist and it surprised me in the best way possible. i thought the reveal was handled in a very intelligent way and it made for a great reading experience. there are a couple of things i found to be over the top and too dramatic but, overall, this is a dang good story and a very impressive debut! michaelides has definitely made it onto my radar for authors to watch!↠ 4.5 stars"
41,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5316099-ova---excuse-my-reading,Rating 2 out of 5,"The things I liked about this book:- Switching between the characters, the psychological information sprinkled into the story(I know some people complained about this, but I quite enjoyed, maybe my lack of information), - the diversity of the side characters(although it puzzled me why the most unlikeable female patient was pointed out as ""turkish"" and what's that or her presence adding to story) , - the pace was good. I disagree with people who say it's boringThe things I didn't like:- ""too many red herrings"". god, I wish their stories at least end up somewhere. I don't want to write spoilers, but what I mean is say, the story wants us to suspect Person A, they have a subplot, but it really doesn't go anywhere. So why did I just read about them then? - I felt an overwhelming masculinity in the style of writing. (Maybe because all the mental patients mentioned were women and men was on the treating, controlling end, who knows? but something bugged me there. )- Unrealistic story : not really about the main plot, but surely, the doctors in a respected mental institution in Britain where health and safety and regulations on sensitive matters are ""sky high"", a new doctor can't just walk in and drop the medication doses for a highly unstable/suicidal patient?? the dialogue and events in hospital made me think ""I hope the psychiatrists in the UK are not really operating like that. God save us if they are!"""
42,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19736308-susan-s-reviews,Rating 5 out of 5,"What a twist!My revised review:After I read the blurb, but before I read this novel, I googled ""Alcestis"" - a tragic Greek figure in mythology: a woman who so loved her husband that she agrees to die in Admetus's place. After Alcestis dies, Heracles descends to the Underworld and battles to retrieve her body; but, according to   one version of this myth, she must remain mute for three days before she is allowed to rejoin the living. When I read this, I thought: aha! Alicia hopes to resurrect her dead husband by remaining mute. (I was wrong!)There are several different adaptations and interpretations of this myth, and the staged production that Alicia Berenger attends in this novel does not refer to this ""three day silence"" requirement that I uncovered during my own research. Instead, the play by Euripides leaves it up to the audience to interpret the reason behind Alcestis's silence. I completely disagreed with Dr. Diomedes' interpretation: that Alcestis was furious with Admetus for accepting her sacrifice. Why volunteer in the first place at all, if you are just going to be resentful about it? Her motives, according to the many statues and paintings commemorating her sacrifice, show her as being noble and selfless.My take: just like Orpheus was not allowed to look back at Eurydice as a condition of her release from the Underworld, the ""three day silence"" rule may have been a similar condition that the Gods liked to impose in granting ""get out of jail passes"" from Hades. Why not simply interpret Alcestis' sacrifice as selfless wifely devotion? At any rate, I think Alicia Berenger does a fine job of explaining things in her own inimitable way, so you will just have to read this excellent thriller to find out. After listening to the very excellent audiobook version of this novel, I was forced to amend my review and add another star to my rating. I see now that the intertwined timelines had caused me some initial confusion - and that this had been a deliberate ploy on the author's part. Hearing the story for a second time, the entire story fell into place more readily. In this case, timing was everything - and I understand now why even using chapter sub-headings could have given the game away. Speaking of timing: Theo Faber makes an appearance in Michaelides' The Maidens, which I thoroughly enjoyed! I highly recommend both of these thrillers - both in ebook and audiobook format. (The audiobooks were very well dramatized. I actually don't like being read to, as a rule, so this is saying a lot!)"

The Written Review
2.5 stars  We're all crazy, I believe, just in different ways.
Alicia Berensons has fascinated a nation...for all the wrong reasons.She was (is?) a renowned painter, she's married to a famous fashion photographer (Gabriel) and lives in a gorgeous house overlooking a beautiful park. To the world, her life is perfect. 
There’s so much pain everywhere, and we just close our eyes to it. The truth is we’re all scared. We’re terrified of each other.
Then one night, Gabriel comes home late and she shoots him in the face five times. And then she never says another word.
Absolutely. Silent.
Throughout her trial, irregardless of pleading, begging or threats - she did not utter one single word and the world was fascinated...for a time.Years later, Theo Faber, a psychotherapist, gets an opportunity to work with Alicia in an inpatient psych ward. He's always been interested in her case and is determined to get her to talk...but as he unravels one secret after another, he soon begins to realize that some truths are best kept hidden.
You become increasingly comfortable with madness - and not just the madness of others, but your own. 
Whewwww...so. This one came to me with a lot of hype. So, I was SUPER psyched when I had a chance to read this one...but...I don't know. It just didn't click for me.I think, I just kept expecting more. And that ""more"" never happened.There were definitely good bits in the book - the premise was SUPER strong and had me hooked from the start. I was riveted by this concept (the silent patient and the psychologist)...but as the plot continued, my enthusiasm waned significantly.There were a LOT of red herrings in this book - so many that at first I was delighted and couldn't wait to see where the book was taking me.But, halfway through, I realized that all that brilliant setup was actually just laying the groundwork for a BIG TWIST (via a lot of little twists that ultimately lead to nothing).Around that time, I realized that no matter the ""real"" story, there was no way it could live up to all the potential hinted at by the red herrings and little false-twists. And when we finally got to the real twist, I felt burned out from all the other ones and my response to the grand reveal was ""ehh.""Also, I think adding in so many of those bits designed to keep the audience guessing actually just increased the number of plotholes because once he finished with the latest herring, he just kind of abandoned it and didn't resolve the issues it left behind.All in all, this was an good book but the hype kind of ruined it for me and the actual plot was a letdown compared to all the brilliance in the beginning.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads"

45,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53328737-michelle,Rating 5 out of 5,"Whoa! This was brilliant! This book right here is the reason that I love psychological thrillers. This has become an overly saturated genre with every one taking a stab at writing these twisty little mind fucks but more often than not they fall flat. It takes a talented mind and writer to pull off a really shocking twist successfully. Alex Michaelides has done just that because I did not see that coming at all and for that I thank you! *claps hands* Alicia Berenson appears to have it all. She's a successful painter and her husband, Gabriel, is a famous fashion photographer. What would drive this seemingly happy woman to shoot her husband five times in the face only to never speak again? Psychotherapist, Theo Faber, is desperate to work with Alicia to see if he can breakthrough her silence to finally find out the truth. That's it. That's all you get. I don't want anyone to be spoiled. I suggest not reading too many reviews as it is inevitable that some jerk will spill the beans. Don't be that jerk! If this is any inclination as to the type of reading year 2019 is going to be then HURRAH! Dare I say that this has made it to my ""favorites"" shelf. Highest recommendation! All the twisted stars! Thank you to Celadon Books and Alex Michaelides for kindly sending me an ARC in exchange for my honest review."
46,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24816039-umut,Rating 2 out of 5,"There's a lot of buzz for this book, so I gave up finally and boy I regret the time I spent on this book. I'm certainly one who will be on the other side of the spectrum. I'm a thriller reader, who cares about details. Pieces need to fall in place nicely, the development of characters, the reasons, motivations. If a writer can't pull these off, then it's not a good thriller for me, and this book is lacking these qualities massively. I'll tell you why I liked this book in one short sentence: Because I finished it no matter what, as it made me wonder the end.Coming to the parts I didn't like:1. Everything was so coincidental! I really dislike this in thrillers. Somehow, all people end up in the same quarters, helping the story to come together. This was the case in this book. It just makes it so unrealistic.2. I figured out who was responsible at 10%, and I was just thinking it can't be that cliche. But, it was. 3. The long waited twist came too late which caused the book to close in a rush, leaving lots of loose ends. The writer opened a lot of sub plots for us to suspect some characters, and somehow forgot to close those ends, oooops! But, who needs a well-rounded story, right? 4. This book is set in UK. It couldn't be more wrong! Clearly, the writer doesn't know anything about UK regulations, social dynamics, culture. Honestly, you can't do what these doctors were doing in a UK hospital. Arranging the dose of meds up and down as you wish, taking patients outside illegally. OMG, it was so ridiculous to read as a person living in UK. These heavy illnesses are taken very seriously here. But, I felt like that hospital was just a farm where everybody did whatever they wanted. I should look after my mental health carefully, if they are like that! 5. There were interesting remarks about nationalities and genders in this book, which bugged me a lot. Why highlight the 'Turkish' patient, painting her as an ugly, aggressive, unlikeable character, when she adds NOTHING to your plot? But, never mention other nationalities like the 'French' gallery manager, other Greek hospital doctor. Yuri, Russian. The writer is Greek, so I'll say that is very interesting. Then, all the victims were women, treated badly, poor them. Or they are portrayed as sluts. All the doctors, managers were men. I just got this vibe, and it disturbed me big time. 6. The inclusion of this Greek Myth was done pathetically as well. Again very coincidental. Alicia was the one who knew the myth, noone else. and for some reason, all the set up happened according to the myth. It just can't happen this way. I have many more things to say if I wanted to give spoilers, but let's leave it here. I really think there are much better thriller writers out there. Peter Swanson's books are amazing, and his new one coming out is mind blowing. The Unwanted Guest is another one by Shari Lapena, was very good."
47,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23082940-justin-tate,Rating 4 out of 5,"A lot to love about this tightly-woven, twist-filled, expertly-structured psychological suspense. It comes in strong and plays all the hits: mysterious clues in paintings, creepy settings, diary entries, suspicious characters, and plenty of jaw-dropping surprises. If you're looking for a mystery that checks all the boxes, here it is. The only thing that's missing is a blackout drunk female narrator--but don't worry, there's a heavily-medicated, silent female to fill that void.Some of the sweeping praise might be excessive. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's brilliant and the plot generally walks along well-trodden ground. That said, I do think the structure is masterfully crafted and goes above and beyond what mystery readers have come to expect. Pacing and sense of time could not have been done better, and I particularly appreciate that it doesn't drag. Most mysteries, I feel, are twice the length with half the intrigue.Michaelides said in an interview that his goal was to write a suspenseful beach read, a la Agatha Christie. With that goal in mind, I would say The Silent Patient is a tremendous success."

I’m giving it 3 stars because I honestly didn’t guess the twist, and it had me shocked af!!! But other than that, this didn’t really blow me away like I thought it would. I did love the short chapters though 👍🏻 "

52,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10490224-orsodimondo,Rating 5 out of 5,"JAB, HOOK, UPPERCUT, K.O.La sempre magnifica Rosamund Pike insieme a Ben Affleck, attore così così, ma interessante regista e produttore (fin qui vincitore di due Oscar), nel film del 2014 di David Fincher “Gone Girl – L’amore bugiardo”.Trovo che ci sia qualcosa di peculiare nella storia personale di questo scrittore, Alex Michaelides.È nato a Cipro quarantadue anni fa. Il padre è greco-cipriota e la madre inglese.Mi viene da pensare che il lato materno gli abbia aperto le porte della futura carriera. Si laurea in Letteratura inglese a Cambridge e poi consegue un Master in sceneggiatura all’American Film Institute di Los Angeles (scuola eccellente).Nella sua carriera di sceneggiatore però mette insieme solo due film, uno realizzato nel 2013, l’altro, il secondo e per ora ultimo, l’anno scorso: due disastri di critica e botteghino.Poi, esordisce nella letteratura. Letteratura di genere. Genere thriller. Il libro esce quest’anno: già tradotto in 42 lingue diverse (L’amica geniale di Elena Ferrante ha fatto qualcosa di meglio, forse è arrivata sulla cinquantina).”Sharp Objects” la serie HBO con protagonista la sempre eccellente Amy Adams (già candidata sei volte all’Oscar). Alla sua destra Patricia Clarkson, a sinsitra Eliza Scanlen.E il suo esordio, il suo primo romanzo, dopo aver scritto due disastrosi film, è una bomba. Un thriller perfetto. Di quelli che ne capita uno a…. No, neppure uno all’anno. Io faccio fatico a ricordarne uno migliore.Per metà ho pensato che il maestro inglese, Sir Alfred Hitchcock, l’avrebbe preso subito per farne uno dei suoi film immortali: un po’ Spellbound - Io ti salverò e un po’ Vertigo – La donna che visse due volte.Per l’altra metà ho pensato a Gillian Flynn, che non ho mai letto, ma ho amato il buon film di David Fincher Gone Girl – L’amore bugiardo e la serie Sharp Objects. E ho amato, come sempre mi succede con lei, Charlize Theron nell’altro Dark Places purtroppo affidato a mani ben meno sapienti e talentuose.Ingrid Bergman e Gregory Peck in “Spellbound – Io ti salverò” di Alfred Hitchcock (1945).Chapeau Mr Michaelides. Io non credo al sogno americano, anche se amo quel paese: ma lei, la sua vicenda personale, mi fa credere d’essermi sbagliato: l’American Dream esiste eccome.Come altro spiegare un percorso professionale di questo tipo?E che film ne faranno! Ieri una produttrice mi diceva che avrebbe voluto i diritti (che sono ovviamente già bloccati – da Brad Pitt e dalla sua Plan B). io le ho detto che no, questo è un film che solo gli americani possono e sanno fare: uno di quei film che deve essere perfetto, cast, ambienti, costumi, trucco, musica, fotografia, tutto al top. Una storia che non richiederebbe budget elevato diventa una produzione consistente perché ogni aspetto è curato alla perfezione e affidato a mani di altissima professionalità. Ma il risultato paga. E rimane nel tempo. ”Vertigo – La donna che visse due volte” di Alfred Hitchcock con James Stewart e Kim Novak. 1958.Lei, Alice, è una pittrice. Accusata d’aver ucciso il marito, fotografo di moda. Uno psicologo, Theo, un gallerista, psichiatri e psicanalisti, vari terapeuti, un avvocato.Altro non voglio dire. Perché questa volta il rischio spoiler è altissimo. È un whodunnit all’ennesima potenza. I colpi di scena sono perfetti e devono poter arrivare inaspettati.La scrittura è scorrevole, perciò è facile tendere a banalizzare il risultato: ma trovare un meccanismo narrativo così perfetto non è facile. E se finora avevo soprattutto familiarità con l’Alceste di Vittorio Alfieri, ora mi è stata introdotta l’Alcesti originale di Euripide, molto più affascinate, simbolo dell’amore più disinteressato, al punto di sacrificarsi e offrire la propria vita in cambio di quella dell’amato. Da far impallidire Orfeo. Jean- François-Pierre Peyron: Alcesti morente. 1785. Louvre.La statua di Alcesti di William Wetmore. 1874."

I was quickly immersed into the story.The premise is intriguing. A psycho therapist begins sessions with a new patient who has been committed to a mental institution after being found guilty of killing her husband 6 years ago. The patient has not uttered a single word in 6 years. Can he make her talk? What really happened all those years ago?This was the author's debut book and what a promising author he is for this genre. He keeps you guessing and the twist was oh so good! Well played Mr. Michaelides! 👏

56,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/105191338-kat-will-try-to-catch-up-soon,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was fun. It grabbed me right from the start and held on. I didn't find out until after reading it that the Mr. Michaelides is also a screenwriter, and in hindsight it makes perfect sense, as the book plays out like a great thriller movie, allowing you to visualize the characters and events vividly and keeping you ""glued to the screen"", so to speak. Even if you have ideas along the way of where the story might go, the book provides enough potential alternatives to keep you unsure until the final act. A great book allows you to go back over the details within and see all the threads that were right in front of you and and understand how they were woven together to make the final piece. He is a very good craftsman, and I'm looking forward to anything else he may write in the future. It's no surprise that the book has been optioned for film, and I only hope it'll do the story justice.Edited 12/11/20: I just have to add this thought, and I can't imagine why I didn't say it last year when I first wrote this review, but that ending is everything. It gobsmacked me in the most brilliant way! Well done, Alex Michaelides.★★★★★ ❤️"
57,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52535740-blake-crouch,Rating 5 out of 5,"Adored this book... Here's my blurb for it: “Alex Michaelides has written one of the best psychological thrillers I have ever read. The Silent Patient is a swarming, paranoid nightmare of a novel with an ending that is destined to go down as one of the most shocking, mind-blowing twists in recent memory.”"
58,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2745288-wendy-darling,Rating 3 out of 5,"2.5 starsThis entire novel is a setup for the twist—everything that is said and done, every character and place is there for no other purpose. You’re told what the characters are like, you’re told what their motivations are—actually, you don’t have to do any thinking at all! The writing is stilted, the ethics are pretty much non-existent for all parties concerned, and most annoyingly and unforgivably, NO ONE WRITES IN A DIARY WITH COMPLETE LINES OF DIALOGUE. NOOOOO ONNNNNEEEEE.I spent a large portion of the book irritated by boundaries that were being crossed, though admittedly some of that did make some sense later on. Some. I’m mixed on the actual plot twist, however—it’s decent in theory but I don’t think it was executed well, nor convincingly plotted. I think the best unreliable narrators tend to be so compelling that you may not notice (or care about?) the evidence before your eyes. I found this guy so frustrating and questioned so many of his day-to-day decisions that the payoff wasn’t there. The entire slew of secondary characters/red herrings/empty props seems completely incapable of controlling themselves in nearly every interaction. Seriously, upon first meeting, you could get bonked on the head or shouted at; get to a third unplanned encounter and a grown man might completely lose it and lay bare all his DEEP AND SEKRIT FEELINGS to you in front of his fiancé and everyone on the sidewalk. Chalk this up to another hyped property that seems written to be turned into the latest prestige cable miniseries/modestly-budgeted-movie-with-starry-names-attached. Whatever you thought of The Girl on the Train (and many other psychological thrillers that have made the rounds the past few years), it was most decidedly written for readers, with a keen interest and empathy for human beings and what dark histories and events push us into behaving the way we do—and it was well-written! I can’t say I feel the same about this one. ETA: there’s plenty of neatly packaged psychobabble here. But it’s heavily expositional, unearned, and unconvincing, whether we’re talking about the silent patient or her wordy therapist. "
59,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42292774-farrah,Rating 5 out of 5,"The longer I spend thinking about this book, the more I realize just how amazing it is! Two things bothered me while I was reading it-1) The way Theo's two storylines felt like they weren't the same person, and2) The unrealistic way The Grove was portrayed. I couldn't tell if it was meant to be a prison or a mental institution but clearly no one there had any idea of how things should be handled either. Now that I've finished the book, I believe these 'problems' were intentional and added to cause confusion and suspense. I was getting a massive Shutter Island vibe! The ending was VERY satisfying and was the exact amount of crazy that it needed to be and left me with a total 'ok, this is a 5⭐ book!' happiness. 🎨🎨🎨🎨🎨"
60,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 stars.I read a lot of thrillers, so I tend to be pretty hard on them. Because, as I've mentioned, I have this tendency to suspect every single character that appears in a thriller, I'm often not as surprised as many others are when authors throw in twists and turns, or when the perpetrator is finally revealed.While I had some suspicions about the way things in Alex Michaelides' terrific debut, 
The Silent Patient
, might go, I will admit he pulled one over on me at one point. I really enjoyed the way he kept me guessing and was completely hooked on this story of murder, infidelity, psychological instability, and the desire to be a savior.Alicia Berenson was an artist of some renown, but these days she's more infamous than anything else. Married to a handsome photographer for whom she is consumed by love, they seem to be the picture-perfect couple, at least to anyone on the outside looking in. One night, her husband came home late from a shoot. Moments later, he was shot five times in the face and killed, and the police found Alicia covered in his blood, as well as her own, as she attempted to slit her own wrists.From that moment on, Alicia hasn't spoken a word. Her trial for her husband's murder was a hotbed of rumors, innuendo, and media sensationalism, but no one ever finds the answers they seek, no one understands what would have made Alicia kill her husband so brutally and then try to take her own life. With no other real choice, the judge sentences her to treatment at the Grove, a forensic unit for dangerous patients, in North London.""And so, with no further revelation forthcoming, the disappointed media eventually lost interest in Alicia Berenson. She joined the ranks of other briefly famous murderers; faces we remember, but whose names we forget.""But psychotherapist Theo Faber continues to be fascinated by Alicia's case, and he believes that only he can reach her, can delve down into her psyche to uncover the secrets that have kept her silent for six years now. When a position opens at the Grove, he is quick to jump on it, and it isn't long before he has convinced the clinical director, Dr. Lazarus Diomedes, to let him begin treating Alicia, even if she hasn't spoken a word to any other doctor, and has displayed sometimes self-harming and sometimes violent behavior toward others.Theo does want to help Alicia and perhaps find out the truth behind her husband's murder and the events of that fateful night. But he's also drawn to her because he believes they share a troubled childhood and even a history of emotional challenges. Theo has struggled with depression throughout his life, yet he believes he's uniquely qualified to help Alicia, and perhaps, himself.""The real motivation was purely selfish. I was on a quest to help myself. I believe the same is true for most people who go into mental health. We are drawn to this profession because we are damaged—we study psychology to heal ourselves. Whether we are prepared to admit this or not is another question.""As Theo attempts to connect with Alicia, he faces challenges from his colleagues and the management of the Grove, who are considering closing down the aging facility, and from Alicia herself. Is she really mad, or is the silence an act? Is she a violent murderer or a misunderstood, grieving widow? Theo seeks answers as his own life seems to be imploding at the same time.The book's narration shifts between past and present, from Theo's endeavors to treat Alicia to Alicia's reflections of the past expressed through her personal journal. I really wasn't sure what to believe about her, and I kept waiting for some surprise to come bursting out of the woodwork. Michaelides does an excellent job teasing out the suspense in small doses, making you suspect different characters along the way, while you race to figure out the truth as Theo tries to do the same.In a sea full of thrillers, I found 
The Silent Patient
 to be a really strong one that stands apart. There were a lot of layers to this book, and Michaelides was like an orchestra conductor, making sure all of the pieces worked together. If this was his debut, there's no telling what he will come up with next. I know I'll be watching.See all of my reviews at itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com.Check out my list of the best books I read in 2018 at https://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com/2019/01/the-best-books-i-read-in-2018.html.

61,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/165736606-lexi,Rating 5 out of 5,MY FIRST FIVE STAR RATING. Ahh I don’t put spoilers in my reviews so you’ll have to find out for yourself but this plot twist is amazing. I usually don’t trust when a book has multiple 5 star reviews but I completely get the hype. There are so many guesses you could make but you’re unlikely to figure out the truth of the mystery until it’s revealed. I. Read. This. In. One. Day. I simply couldn’t put it down until I found out what was going on. The chapters are extremely short so one leads to another and I personally never wanted to stop until I figured out the truth. This thriller is seriously so good!!
62,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/80549046-lit-with-leigh,Rating 5 out of 5," Writing: 3.5 tbh but 5 bc of how he disguised the twist /5 | Plot: 5/5 | Ending: 5/5  THE PLOT 6 years ago, Alicia Berenson popped her husband in the face 5 times at point-blank range and then stayed silent. She hasn't said a word since. Now, ""living"" in a pysch hospital, psychotherapist Theo intentionally gets a job there in hopes she'll finally tell her side of the story.  MY OPINION OKKURRRTTT... LOVED IT (if you couldn't tell by the rating). This was fire flame. Usually books that are hyped up like this fall short (AHEM The Wife Between Us), but I felt like this lived up to the chatter. I loved it for 2 reasons: the psychological breakdown of why we are the way we are and do the things we do was LEGIT (and I know b/c I'm a frequent flyer at therapy). It provided expert insight into our behaviours... So not only did I get to indulge my psycho senses, but I learned something too. Our childhood really is the blueprint for our behaviours. Reason #2 I loved it: the twist. I kind of saw it coming... but still. It was well-shielded for the majority of the novel.  PROS AND CONS Pros: Juicy J, insightful, educational, well-paced, actually a psychological thriller. Theo put the psycho in psychotherapist. Cons: Writing quality was subpar at best. It wasn't anything to write home about (hehe), but it was tolerable."
63,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit,Rating 4 out of 5,"Alex Michaelides impresses with his terrific debut, a twisted, multilayered, intricate, and complex psychological thriller of murder, obsession and madness. Famous artist, Alicia Berenson, married to well known photographer, Gabriel, shoots her husband five times and has not spoken since. After a plea of diminished responsibility, she has been incarcerated at a North London psychiatric facility of The Grove. Ambitious Theo Faber is a forensic psychotherapist, obsessed with Alicia having followed her story, and when a vacancy opens up at The Grove, he finds his way in. No-one has managed to get Alicia to open up, Theo sees himself succeeding where everyone else has failed. Alice may be silent, but silence can speak by other means, such as Alicia's self portrait that draws on Greek mythology where she depicts herself as Alcestis.In a narrative that includes Alicia's diary entries, we learn of Alicia's past through Theo's investigations, as he goes over and above the call of duty to uncover what motivated Alicia by turning to those who knew her, from family to those from the art world. It turns out Alicia had a troubled upbringing, which included the suicides of her parents. Theo himself has a difficult past too, but as he digs deeper into the silence, what will he find? And will everyone welcome the truth? This is a fast paced thriller of secrets, marriage, and mental health issues. There are twists and surprises as the tension and suspense ratchets up. This is an intelligent, gripping and an utterly thrilling read with wonderful characterisation in both Alicia and Theo. Definitely a must read for those who love psychological thrillers. Many thanks to Orion for an ARC."
64,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33411728-bibi,Rating 3 out of 5,"*Upgraded to 3 stars*First-person perspectives are tricky because we’re presented with a 2-D story; moreover, the narrators are notoriously biased and unreliable. In the hands of a seasoned author the reader might not notice the misdirections or the limited scope, however, and considering this is a character-driven plot, this book laboured and consequently suffered due to the deliberate vagueness which in turn meant the characters were contained and unable to fully evolve. Motivations were also suspect, as there was no upside for Theo to act as he did. NONE.Alicia, our “silent patient” was accused and subsequently found guilty of killing her husband, but since she can’t or won’t speak, the court remanded her to a psychiatric care unit called “The Grove” where she stays for six years before meeting our narrator and protagonist, Theo, a psychotherapist intent on saving her. Eventually, he succeeds in getting Alicia to speak and finally we understand why she chose to stay mute. Did I see the twist coming? No. So, 5 stars for that.Did I relate or empathize with the protagonists? Not in the slightest. 2 starsWas the story intriguing and captivating? In a manner, if you discount that lacklustre character development. I mean, it seemed that every single person needed serious mental health care which made it quite unrealistic. 2 starsOverall, 3 stars, but nonetheless a valiant debut from Michaelides, who is now placed on my auto-buy list.

65,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73431206-richard-on-hiatus,Rating 4 out of 5,"I try not to over analyse thrillers. They are either well enough written to engage or not. Sometimes a good thriller will have a plot that intrigues or contain relatable characters. Sometimes the author paces the narrative well with tense cliff hangers, imaginative twists, clever false trails etc etc. Sometimes the premise or setting is original or intriguing.Very, very occasionally an author does all of the above but with an extra something that touches a nerve and renders the book utterly compulsive. This happened with The Silent Patient the much hyped novel by Alex Michaelides.I couldn’t put the book down, time stopped, pages were devoured greedily and I read long into the night to finish (clichés but true!) This hasn’t happened for a long time.Alicia, a successful painter is incarcerated in a psychiatric facility after being found guilty of shooting dead her husband, Gabriel, at point blank range. She was found standing over the body with a gun at her feet.Since this horrific incidence Alicia hasn’t spoken a word.Theo is a young psychiatrist who begins work at this establishment. He tries to help Alicia and becomes involved in trying to uncover the truth of what happened that terrible night.The story is loosely tied to the Greek tragedy of Alcestis by Euripides, a theme that colours the novel.The strange thing is, as I think back to the novel, the writing was fine but not amazing, the characters a little thinly drawn and the plot was a tad unlikely ........... but somehow it all still worked brilliantly.I guess the way we personally connect to a book is based largely on our preferences, our mood when reading and our expectations etc but I like the fact that it can’t be completely explained.This was a gripping, sweaty palmed thriller, that for me at least, lived up to the hype."

I buddy read this one with Jacqueline and I am so shocked by how much I loved this. This is an adult thriller that follows from the POV of Theo Faber, a psychotherapist who is working on a special case in a psychiatric ward, his patient being Alicia Berenson who recently murdered her husband for no apparent reason and hasn't spoken since. This book reminded me a lot of the tv show The Sinner because a woman randomly murders someone and you spend the majority of the story trying to understand why. I feel like the first 50 pages or so were hard to get into, but after that I literally could not put it down. I was so invested in the story and I finished it all in a day because I just had to know where it was going. And this book did not let me down - the ending had one of the best plot twists I've ever read. Like... I was freaking shook! It changed everything I thought I knew about the story and I was just so impressed, I didn't see it coming at all.I gave this book five stars mainly because of that epic plot twist alone!

This book is about obsession, betrayal and lost love. The plot hooked me right from the get-go, and the characters had me captivated! Why did Alicia kill her husband? Will Theo, her psychotherapist, get her to open up and come to grips with her crime?I love a good suspense thriller, and this one had me guessing the ""whodunit"" right to the end! At one point, I could feel Theo's intense anger, fear and pain when he was suspicious of his wife's infidelity. I recommend listening to this audiobook. Narration by Louise Brealey and Jack Hawkins was spot-on! And the cover design is a little chilling!"

(i think)i have alex’s other recent release, the maidens, and it’s been pushed up my tbr. i heard it’s a dark academia thriller though so, i might save it for the fall season !!"

77,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4125660-liz,Rating 4 out of 5,"I went into this not knowing much about it, other than it was getting high marks on GR and other book sites I frequent. Well, it wasn’t what I anticipated as far as plot. I thought it would be all about Alicia, an artist who kills her husband and then stops speaking. But it’s as much, if not more, about Theo, her therapist. It definitely gripped me from the get go. Everyone seems to have secrets and be lying. Families and marriages are truly screwed up. I loved the way the author used psychological theories and Greek mythology to move the story forward. Theo was a fascinating character. I never knew what to make of him. Was he helping or hurting Alicia? Did he really know what the hell he was doing? The book’s pace is perfect. A Goldilocks not too fast, not too slow book. I listened to this and both narrators did a good job. I kept finding myself searching for ways to sneak a few extra minutes of listening time into my day. I did foresee most of the supposed twist at the end. Not entirely, but enough. There were also a few holes in the plot which prevent me from giving this a five star rating. Take the time to listen to the interview with the author, which discusses his inspiration for the book. "
78,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11345366-jayme,Rating 5 out of 5,"Promising to be the debut novel of the season, I decided to make this my first read of 2019! I am glad I did not wait any longer...Alicia Berenson was a famous painter, married to an in-demand fashion photographer, living what appears to be a life that others would envy...till she kills her husband by shooting him in the face, five times, and never speaks another word. Her only assertion about what happened is her self portrait, Alcestis, named after the tragic heroine of the Greek tragedy by Euripides. Her painting is of her naked body, fresh scars on her wrist, a blank expression on her face and a paintbrush in her hands, dripping red paint...or is it blood? Determined to get her to talk is Theo Fabre, a criminal psychotherapist. He begins a quest for the truth, not unlike what a detective might do, but is he the right Doctor for this patient?Excerpt: Alicia was standing by the wall, being restrained by Yuri and another nurse. But no physical restraint was necessary. She was totally calm, perfectly still, like a statue. her expression reminded me sharply of the painting-the Alcestis. Blank. Expressionless. Empty. She stared straight at me. For the first time, I felt afraid.Told from Theo’s perspective and through Alicia’s diary entries, I still did not know where this book was going with only 10% left to read. It was probably just a 4 star read for me at this point.And, then the ENDING.I did NOT see it coming. And, I was NOT disappointed. I have no hesitation in recommending this to readers who love a good psychological thriller. NOW AVAILABLE!!I would like to thank Netgalley, Celadon books, and Alex Michaelides for the ARC I received in exchange for a candid review! Posted to Goodreads now, and Amazon on publication date."
79,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11232712-joey-r,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.0 Stars— I was very excited to read “The Silent Patient” by Alex Michaelides after reading the glowing reviews it received on Goodreads. In my opinion, this book was slow in developing so it took a long time before I became invested in the plot and characters. I was over halfway through the book before I felt it really began gaining momentum. The ending though was genius with one surprise twist after another that was great fun to read. “The Silent Patient” is told primarily from the point of view of Theo, a psychotherapist,who was hired at a mental facility to treat the patients there. Those patients include Alicia who was sent there after allegedly killing her husband but has never spoken since being found with his body. Theo is determined to help her and attempts many different approaches to do so including reinvestigating the murder himself. Building the background of the characters as well as learning about Alicia by way of excerpts from her diary cause the early parts of the novel to drag. But, the eventual payoff as well as how seamlessly the author intertwines all of the characters, subplots and storylines together makes this one a must read. Nowhere close to “Verity” as far as fast-paced great thrillers I’ve read recently but still well worth the time to dig into."
80,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4514828-susanne,Rating 4 out of 5,"4 Stars.Bravo to Alex Michaelides for writing a Fabulous Mystery/Suspense!There’s something to be said for being silent. Just ask Alicia Berenson. After shooting her husband in the face five (5) times, she remains silent. Thereafter, she is remanded to a mental hospital called the Grove where no one can get her to utter another word. Theo Farber is a Psychotherapist, who, after being hired, begins treating Alicia Berenson. He is desperate to help her. Unfortunately, sometimes the genie is better left in the bottle!“The Silent Patient” is a psychological suspense at its best. While I had an inkling in the beginning as to what was going on - it completely escaped me at the midway point, such that by the end, I was so torn up about one character that I was like “Oh duh!” (Insert emoji hand to the face!!). What else can I tell you? This is storytelling at it best. Admittedly, the psychology behind this one is a bit dark and disturbing and it got to me!  Believe it or not, I do have experience with staying silent. It’s not easy guys! When I was 10, I had an all girls birthday party and my mom suggested this game (which should speak volumes (lol)), it was called: “Who could be quietest the longest?” Needless to say, I didn’t win (I lasted 5 minutes). My friend Beth won and was silent for 30 minutes. Now at 10 years old, being silent for 30 minutes was an eternity.. I’m still impressed to this day! Thinking about the amount of time Alicia Berenstein was silent in this novel, well, given the story I told you above, it’s not something I can imagine. “The Silent Patient” is a fast-paced novel with thrilling characters that keeps you on your toes. The motivation behind them kept me intrigued and I am sure it will do the same for you! This was a buddy read with Kaceey which we both really enjoyed. Thank you for waiting for me to read this one Kaceey! I really appreciate it.Published on Goodreads, Twitter and Amazon on 4.7.19."

The narrator of the audiobook did a truly exceptional job. I so enjoyed how the tension in this mystery was built upon, chapter by chapter, creating guess after guess swirling in my head. I knew I would guess wrong, but it was exciting nonetheless ;)And that ending ... whoa!!The bonus interview with Alex Michaelides at the end of the audiobook was unexpected and very enlightening. Recalling his summers as a child living in Cypress, he said, “I would go to the beach and devour Agatha Christie’s.” He would read one every three days, and it was the happiest time of his life.

But real love is very quiet, very still. It's boring, if seen from the perspective of high drama. Love is deep and calm - and constant.”A compulsive and gripping story with a fantastic yet unpredictable ending to give this 5-star read its rightful place as a best seller. Captivating from beginning to end.Alicia Berenson is found standing over her husband who has been shot several times in the face. Its an open and shut case. You would think – wouldn’t you? But of course not. What follows next is just brilliant, Alicia refuses to offer a defence and has remained silent for over 5 years, so no one knows what drove this woman leading a perfectly normal life to carry out such a brutal attack on her husband. When Theo is offered a job to move to the Grove and work with Alicia he jumps at the opportunity. We can probably predict that he will get her to talk although this was one mammoth challenge but what we can’t predict was the journey and the ending that was just outstanding.The psychological aspect of the book was so believable, the plot was well thought through and brilliantly narrated. The writing was superb, and the characters were so well drawn and believable. Gripping, thrilling with suspense that was accretive and perpetuating. I have read both the “Silent Patient” and “The Maidens” from Alex Michaelides and loved both and in my top 10 in 2021. I do like this authors writing style.So, Dear Alex, please keep the books coming, your sincerely Margaret 😃"

Choosing a lover is a lot like choosing a therapist. We need to ask ourselves, is this someone who will be honest with me, listen to criticism, admit making mistakes, and not promise the impossible?
I've read A LOT of psychological thrillers. In fact, it's my favorite genre to read. Since I've read so many, a lot of the times I see the same story lines and this book is a new story line for me. It gives me that thrill.Alicia Berenson is no longer speaking. She has just been found guilty for shooting her Husband, Gabriel. Theo Faber has a troubled past. He decides early on that he wants to becoming a psychotherapist so that he can help people the way he was never helped. He learns that Alicia is a patient at the center he just laded at a job at. He also hears she is mute and wants to take on the challenge of getting her to talk and find out what really happened.Throughout Alicia's life, she was an Artist and her art was a her best way of communicating her feelings and thoughts. One day, Theo thinks to present Alicia with her own art canvas, outside of art therapy, to express how she feels. She starts to paint and they're convinced they are getting to her. One day, Alicia reacts to Theo and ends up handing him a Diary that she has kept with the entire story, well at least Theo thinks it's the entire story. From here, a couple twists unravel only to unveil the grand finale. I'll tell you, 
this twist got me.
I'm still thinking about it.This is both Alicia and Theo's parallel stories about problems that have happened in their lives. Theo has family and marital issues and Alicia has psychological and trust issues. I loved that the author included psychological issues even within the psychological team in the book. I think this is what really made it a home run for me.This book is a debut and by no means would I have assumed that when I read it. It's written at a perfect pace and worded just right so that you most likely aren't going to guess the twist. I had my theories but I was so so so wrong. I also had that 
WHAT
 moment and that's a sign of a good book, for me. I am personally interested in psychology (psych minor in college!) and I have dealt with Depression/Anxiety for years now. I think being interested in these and invested in characters who deal with these issues made this book shine, in my opinion.This book will easily go down as one of my top 5 in 2019. I will definitely be reading more of Alex Michaelides books in the future. If you're a thriller fan, you need to pick this one up 100000%! It publishes February 5, 2019!Thank you to the publisher, Celadon books, for my ARC of this book"
86,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/80033559-kylie-d,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is one stealth bomber of a psychological thriller, it sneaks up on you and then whammo!It starts out with Theo, a psychotherapist, getting a new job in a facility that contains a patient named Alicia, infamous for killing her husband several years ago, then clamming up and not saying a word since. Theo soon thinks he can help her, gain her trust, and soon becomes consumed with Alicia. Slowly he starts to make progress with her, despite the antagonism of his colleagues, and when we finally get to the truth of that night, well, let's just say it's mind-blowing.This is a book that intrigued me, and I found myself racing to a surprising, yet satisfying conclusion. I never once got any inkling of the twist, and it was stunning. Recommended for all lovers of psychological thrillers."

88,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106473614-she-who-must-not-be-named,Rating 3 out of 5," Five gunshots. An accused murderer who refuses to speak. A psychiatrist who will stop at nothing to get her to speak. A perfect psychological thriller. I'm still reeling from how shocked I am. This is every bit the kind of psychological thriller I've wanted to lay my hands on. I'm guilty as charged for not knowing this book's existence before. The last few chapters paved the way for an already amazing story and I felt my mind cluttered with questions. I'm not usually strict with my ratings, except for when I rate thrillers. I usually expect a thriller to be fast-paced and unpredictable which keeps readers on the edge of their seats with apprehension of forthcoming twists. This book, undoubtedly, had it all. The fact that the book is narrated in first person and highlights the thoughts of the narrator and his past eloquently, accentuated the appeal of the story.The story focuses on the lives of: 1) Alicia Berenson  whose notoreity seems to overshadow her insanely good painting skills. She is the type of person that conveys her feelings-be it anger, resentment, elation or love through actions more than words, even if it means expressing anger and lashing out at the other person to the point of drawing blood. She is truly a force to be reckoned with.2) and Theo Faber , our narrator who is determined to get Alicia to speak even if the odds are against him. Battling demons of his own past, he understands Alicia's pain more than anyone else when in fact everybody's faith seems to deteriorate and consider her silence deliberate and pretentious.Every character has an air of suspicion and doubt surrounding them. No one can be trusted. The writing style is beyond compelling aimed to capture your attention right from the get go. This piece of art is a job well done and definitely deserves 5⭐"

I will never for the life of me understand how it has over 300k ratings here on Goodreads with an average over 4. I had been hoping for a cheesy, enjoyable page turner, and I got a steaming pile of nonsense. It is without a doubt the worst book I have ever read. Among its many sins are the frequent one-sentence paragraphs strewn throughout. Like the one above. And this one. I can’t even begin to describe in a way that would do it justice the ridiculousness of plot, of characters’ behavior, of leaps of logic, of terrible similes.I regret reading this book. So much.

The obvious scenario is that she shot him?Alicia was taken to a psychiatric facility called The Grove, where she has not spoken for 6 years. Will the truth ever be revealed and will She ever speak again!!A new Psychiatrist Theo arrives at The Grove determined that he can help Alicia and win her trust, so that she will speak again. He investigates her past and becomes obsessed with finding out the truth. This story takes us on a journey with an abundance of twists and turns that left me speechless at the end. I really did not expect that outcome and had to re-read it as I still can’t believe what just happened. I needed a lie down in a dark room to recover!!!

Clear you’re diary first as you won’t want to put this down!!Thank you to Netgalley for my copy in exchange for a review."

Yeah, for some reason this book just didn't do the trick for. For one thing, it didn't feel like a thriller, or it lacked thrilling moments for me. The story felt flat, and likewise did the characters, especially Theo Faber. I'm sorry, but he mostly annoyed me, with his obsession with Alicia Berenson and his marriage problem. And, from the beginning, it is clear that he's not that mentally sound so I wasn't surprised when ""things"" happened toward the end. I felt that the story was just idling along, it never picked up the pace and neither Alicia's diary entries nor Theo's POV really grabbed my interest. At least it was pleasant enough that I could finish the book. Now, of course, there must be some twist to the story and sure enough, when the book was nearly done did it show up. And, yes I have to admit that it was a clever move, alas a bit too late for me and frankly not especially imaginative. It felt a bit like it's been done before and I just felt a bit tired and not impressed. Well, my review is pretty negative, but it's hard to think of anything good to write when I mostly felt like it was not the right book for me. I like my thrillers to draw me in, and for the characters to be fascinating to read about. This book, nah.

97,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt,Rating 4 out of 5,"My introduction to Alex Michaelides was with this highly popular piece that seems to be a favourite of many. Said to be trained in film-writing, Michaelides definitely uses description effectively to build the tension in this chilling novel. Alicia Berenson is a popular painters and seems to be living an ideal life. Everything goes horribly wrong when her husband, Gabriel, returns home late. Berenson is said to have pulled out a gun and shot him repeatedly in the face, then never spoken again. Now institutionalised, she spends her days in silence, refusing to come to her own defences or offer any explanation as to what might have happened. When she is assigned a new psychotherapist, Theo Faber, the relationship continues to be one without words. Faber works all the angles to seek answers, if only to help his patient. While there are aspects to Berenson’s life and history that come up in speaking to those close to her, Faber cannot find what he seeks. As he juggles work with an adulterous wife, Faber discovers that silence certainly does mask many a secret. After countless attempts to get answers from Berenson, Faber succeeds in getting a few scraps, though the tale that he is told seems highly improbable. With a full diary kept by Alicia Berenson, the inner workings of the patient’s life come to the surface, though there is little Faber finds that explains the horrible crime. The key is somewhere inside Alicia Berenson, though no one is quite sure if and how to reach it. When they do, much left unsaid will fill in many of the missing pieces. Chilling in its delivery and quite intriguing to the interested reader, Alex Michaelides knows how to spin a tale. Those who enjoy mysteries that centre around the slow revelation of facts will surely want to keep this on their radar.My small book group brought attention of this book to me. I was pleased to be able to share in the discovery of a new author and a story that piqued my attention. Michaelides uses his ability to tell a story and develop characters of interest to the reader. Both Alicia Berenson and Theo Faber prove to be strong protagonists in their own right, helping to shape the narrative with their backstories and character development. As the piece tells both of their personal lives, neither of which being highly enjoyable for them, the reader learns what might be said to pull them together as they move forward. The silence that Berenson exhibits is not only a challenge for Faber, but also forces him to use his own intuition when trying to learn about the woman he is supposed to help. The reader learns much in these fragmented revelations and can fill some of the holes for themselves, though the surprises that come to pass will offer needed twists to keep the reader wondering. Other characters help to augment the enjoyment of the piece for many readers, as things are more complex than seen at first glance. These characters help support a strong narrative and offer lovely insights into how the story will play out. The concept of the story is strong and I found myself eager to see where the truth may lie amidst all the chaos and silence. Michaelides knows how to piece together a mystery and keeps the reader intrigued without revealing too much at once, until the final reveal that tells all in a compact few pages. I enjoyed my first experience with the author and will likely return for another novel down the road.Kudos, Mr. Michaelides, for this great piece. I can only hope your other writing is just as strong.This book serves as the September 2019 selection for the Mind the Bookshelf Gap book group. Love/hate the review?

Theo Faber, a local therapist, has become fascinated with Alicia’s case and jumps on an opportunity to work with her, convincing everyone that he’s up for the challenge. As the story progresses, much more is revealed about Alicia and her seemingly perfect life, and Theo, who’s also dealing with his own issues while he pursues the “why?” behind the mysterious Alicia. This book is dark and suspenseful. The short chapters in addition to the intriguing storyline, made it easy to read quickly.

Paying attention to this character study might pay off with picking up some of those well-layered clues that lead to a very pleasing gasp-worthy twist. One even if you did pick up on some of those layered clues you might still find yourself shocked and left speechless. I highly recommend!"

I couldn’t have guessed any of the twists here - in fact, all my initial suspicions were wrong. I loved this book & the characters. Although, I could do without the short explanation at the end. If you read my reviews regularly, you already know how I feel about explaining things in the end. Overall, it’s in my personal top 3 fav thrillers. "
101,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/96573177-sophia-judice,Rating 5 out of 5,"the silent patient truly exceeded my already high expectations. immediately, based on the story, the unreliable narrators, as well as the format of the book, i was picking up on a gone girl (one of my all time favorite books) vibe, which was much appreciated. i love how the narrators broke the fourth wall, because it made me more invested in the story, and i loved the use of intertextuality by way of euripides’ alcestis. it added so much nuance and depth to an already complex plot. with that being said, alicia and theo are genuinely some of the most intriguing characters i’ve ever read. reading books with unreliable narrators forces me to question everything and trust no one, but nothing could have prepared me for this plot twist. it was literally insane and had me so confused, and then soon enough, everything came together and made sense. drop what you’re doing right now, and read this mf book.

102,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126347706-zo,Rating 2 out of 5,"Now I agree with the masses; the plot twist was good. But can you really base an entire book around a single twist and fill the rest with, well, filler? My answer would be no, but here we are with the most popular mystery/thriller novel right now!Don’t get me wrong, The Silent Patient wasn’t just 300 pages of nothing; it was 300 pages of nothing with some added sexism and mental health stigma! My favorite!! This book has some of the worst written female “characters” (if you can call them that) that I’ve ever had the misfortune to encounter. The journal entry components read like Alex Michaelides has never met a woman before and considering Alicia is the focal point of the novel, I would’ve expected her to be a more compelling character. Truly unfortunate that she got the same one-dimensional treatment as the other women in the book, because this definitely had potential!Speaking of the diary entries, am I the only one who thought that was a major plot hole? How was the journal not found when police searched her house after the murder? How was she able to bring it with her to the institution without anyone reading it? I mean there was a LOT in there that could’ve aided her in court, so it was a very surprising oversight to me. I know this is a bit nit-picky, but I also hate it when journal entries in books are unrealistically descriptive. How the hell is Alicia remembering and writing down every last word of these conversations? I think this can work if most or all of the story is told in that manner (like The Catcher in the Rye or Wuthering Heights for example), but it felt a bit hard to believe in this context. I do understand how important the diary ended up being in the end though, so it wasn’t a terribly big deal, I just enjoy complaining!Speaking of plot holes, you mean to tell me that over 6 years have passed since this famous crime, and no one has tried to delve deeper into Alicia’s last painting? Furthermore, no one at The Grove thought to let her paint privately, because it would be “special treatment”?? I mean what kind of mental health institution is this; therapy is SUPPOSSED to be individual. Maybe it was intentional, but The Grove as a whole really pissed me off. We have therapists using “borderline” as an insult, considering Alicia a lost cause and giving up on her fairly quickly, and even calling her an “uncommunicative bitch” and a “terrible example to the others” for being nonverbal. Again, I’m not sure if the tone of this book was supposed to condemn these remarks, but there was a lot of misinformation on mental illness and abuse sprinkled throughout as well, for example, ""She had, in thirty years of extensive work with pedophiles, never met one who hadn’t himself been abused as a child. This doesn’t mean that all abused children go in to become abusers, but it is impossible for someone who was not abused to become an abuser. No one is born evil.” I hate to break it to you, but people are “born” pedophiles; it’s a false wiring of the brain. Not all pedophiles are sex offenders or even evil, and not all child sex offenders are pedophiles. Abuse isn’t always caused by past abuse and doesn’t always stem from a place of evil. I really don’t think it’s too much to ask for authors to research serious topics before they write about them, but here we go again.This story had so much potential, and I think Michaelides is great at constructing a good twist, but close to nothing else in the book sat right with me which really sucks! Better luck next time, folks.Books around the globe: Cyprus"

So delicious in fact, that as soon as I finished, I had to read it again. That has never happened to me before. I will probably read it again at some point in the near future. It was that good. I just didn't want to let it go.I'm going to keep this bit short because no spoilers allowed. I loved the writing. I loved how distinct the characters were. I loved loved loved the twist. It felt like the story was on a mobius strip, and suddenly everything was upside down. I also loved how short the chapters were, making it impossible to not read just one more chapter.I listened to this on audiobook as well. The two narrators did a lovely job and honestly I could listen to it all day, every day. The male narrator did all the different accents wonderfully--at least as far as I could tell--and the female had the most soothing voice I've ever heard. I completely understand why she gets paid to read out loud. She's a famous actress but I didn't realize she did audiobooks. How lucky are we?!Overall it was spectacular. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. I think it's safe to say that this is my favorite thriller of all time. If you haven't read it, this should be at the top of your list for 2021. Start the year off right.""And I went to catch another one."""
104,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25532045-kat-books-are-comfort-food,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow, what a wonderful read. I loved this book abd even stayed up late (or early) to finish it (and paying fir it now). 😉A woman is found with a gun in her hand and her dead husband next to her. Did she really do it? We can’t tell anything because she’s literally stopped talking, which makes her seem even more guilty. I was attracted to the story and subject matter. The writing is excellent; crisp, clear. I lived the Greek mythology that surrounds the story. The story was perfectly paced and I was so interested to what would happen next. However, the biggest bang for me was toward the ending where I suddenly felt the room spin out of control and I had to go back and reread what I had just read, because I was so surprised. And then as the story continued everything fell into place. I had quite a few theories going because it seemed that several characters had plenty of motives and secrets. But none of my theories were correct. I loved Alex Michaelides writing and I will look forward to more stories. "

You become increasingly comfortable with madness -- and not just the madness of others, but your own. We're all crazy, I believe, just in different ways.""The details of Gabriel's death leave very little to question. He's been strapped to a chair with five deadly gunshot wounds right to the face. His wife, Alicia, stands in the darkness dressed in all white. The handgun lays near her feet. And from that moment on, Alicia utters not a single word for years.Theo Faber, a criminal psychotherapist, is trying to fit in at his new position at The Grove, a secure psychiatric unit in North London. He's become intrigued by Alicia's case and does everything possible to be assigned to her case. Silence is golden and Alicia has maintained that little nugget from the moment she was arrested for her husband's murder. No other therapist has been able to reach into the locked vault of Alicia's mind. But Theo's persistence may be the key here as the readers lean in Theo's direction to clear the muddied waters.Alex Michaelides has us following at his heels as he takes us into the questionably run unit. We meet only a few of the patients, but we come face-to-face with the aloof caretakers and therapists. Believe me, The Grove is on the precipice of a shut-down and, as readers, we gingerly step over the nuts and bolts coming loose and rolling across the floor. As the pages turn, Michaelides lines up his varied characters who readily should take up residence within the walls of The Grove themselves. He allows us to hear the marbles rolling around inside their heads. Planned and plotted, this author likes the sound of a spinning wheel that can point in many a direction. You may or may not figure out where these breadcrumbs are leading. But this is a fictional funhouse, dear readers, with circus mirrors that don't always reflect reality. It's a debut novel from an up and coming author with great promise. The ending has quite the snap. So make sure your seatbelt is clicked and enjoy the ride."

107,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39722464-arini,Rating 3 out of 5,"Eh. I’m surprised this won the Goodreads Choice Awards considering most of it is pretty uneventful. But to each their own . . .Alicia Berenson shoots her husband five times in the face and subsequently decides to stay mute. A criminal psychotherapist, Theo Faber, convinced he’s the man for the job who’ll get Alicia back to talking and uncover the mystery behind her murder.Obviously, I take an award winning book from this genre would have to be plot driven, scary, thrilling, dark, and twisty. Well, to be honest that’s just how I prefer thrillers in general.The Silent Patient has nothing going for it, except the big plot twist at the end of the book, which I will admit I did not see coming. Okay, fine, besides that, it’s also a fast read. Meaning, the book is short and the writing, or the unreliable narrator specifically, makes you want to compulsively read it. Plot wise, it’s a slow burn with excruciating and monotonous build up.Crackpot 1For most of the book, we follow Theo on his repeated interviews with Alicia’s relatives, friends, and neighbors. I know right, is he a doctor or a detective? I’m not sure if it’s ethical for a man in his position to investigate a homicide on his own even if it’s under the guise of understanding his patient’s psyche. Though, now that I think of it, I should’ve taken this unusual interest and out of character behavior as its own clue.Crackpot 2 and 3I found Alicia’s abrupt decision to speak to be convenient and absurd. She hasn’t used her voice in six years. Wouldn’t she need a speech therapy or at least require a short time break to practice? Let’s not forget the diary! It’s just another convenience. I’m not one to keep a personal journal or diary, but if I were, I don’t think I’d write about my days and encounters as explicitly as she does. I mean, to even include dialogues or conversations, I think rarely ANYONE would do that.This is a solid debut, if not a little anticlimactic and underwhelming considering the hype. I think it could’ve been truly profound, utterly mind bending, and unforgettable had the characters been allowed to evolve and the convenient coincidences been avoided or made less implausible. In the meantime, start examining your childhood before it’s too late, don’t trust your husband, and definitely do a background check of your therapist before attending session! Who knows what a nutjob they might turn out to be.

108,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2795921-justin,Rating 4 out of 5,"So I had this rated as a solid, everyday, regular old 3 stars, but I just bumped it up to 4 stars, okay? I’m a changed man, Goodreads. The old me would rate this right down the middle and light up three boring little stars. The old me would tell you that this book was a page-turner, but is has a lot of flaws. I would proceed to point out those flaws, but I would also explain how it was still good and all. I’d probably say something about how you could read this book at the beach or by the pool and how it’s a great summer thriller or something. I was so close to just doing that, but I’m not gonna lie to all of my friends here on the Internet. So...The plot twist got me, alright? I wasn’t expecting it. I wasn’t looking for clues along the way. I was just reading the stupid book, and that snuck up on me, and I literally had to put the book down for a few seconds. I also thought the ending was very satisfying, and it didn’t seem like it was going to be... so yeah that was cool. There was a definite The Silence of the Lambs or Shutter Island thing going on as the book kicked off. You’ve got Mr. Psychotherapist who also moonlights as a detective I guess. You have the patient who doesn’t speak, but he’s gonna use his detective and psychotherapist skills to be the one guy that gets her to talk. You’ve got the employee you can’t trust. The building is about to be shut down. It all feels familiar. Short chapters. All that. But as I found myself up early this morning flying through the last hundred pages or so because the rain prevented me from running, I came to the realization that I was really enjoying my time reading this. I looked forward to seeing where it went next, hoping for Alice to talk, waiting for the big reveal. And it got me. It went somewhere I wasn’t expecting and it took things to another level for me. I can’t say for sure this is any better than any other thriller out there, but I enjoyed my time with it, so I’m rating it higher than I wanted to. I’m usually the first to pick this kind of book apart, and usually find myself not enjoying this stuff, but whatever.You should read this book at the beach or by the pool, or early in the morning when it’s too wet to run."
109,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106445108-allison-faught,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5, but closer to a 5 than a 4. I accidentally found out Theo was the masked man before I started the book which was beyond heartbreaking because I know I would have been even more surprised by that crazy ending had I not known the truth about him. But that didn’t completely take away the suspense as there were a few twists and turns at the end that I wasn’t expecting. I wish that Theo was crazy instead of completely aware of his actions and intentions. I got really excited he was going to find out about the horrible thing he had done but instead he knew all along.Part 4: Chapter 21 blew me away. I couldn’t believe what I had just read that I had to reread it 3 times to really let it sink in. I love books that have that effect on me. I liked that the reader was drawn away from the timeline of it all. Had it been expressed that the affair was happening 6 years prior, I might have come to the conclusion on my own that Kathy was sleeping with Gabriel. That was definitely a shock that I wasn’t expecting. I’d love for this author to write more books as I would be excited to read more from him."

The patient is a murderer who has never spoken since the night of her crime. He wants to know why she hasn't spoken, indeed her self-imposed mutism is more intriguing to him than her deadly deed. The doctor, we soon find, has his own problems which include a wretched, loveless childhood. His father is violent, given to fits of rage. In this, he is much like his patient who also endured a miserable life as a child. Her mother committed suicide with her in the car, and her father was bitter and abusive. Theo, the doctor, is obsessed with Alicia. Their relationship is not a typical doctor/patient one. He thinks of nothing else and his marriage starts to unravel. The final denouement is startling and shocking, and one I didn't see coming."

It may be the silence of rage. Perhaps it is a watchful, patient silence. It may also be the silence of simply having nothing to say.

You can find my channel here! =)”Love that doesn’t include honesty doesn’t deserve to be called love.”Oh boy, what did I read and did I read the same book everyone else read?! Because I’m definitely going to be an unpopular opinion here and once I’m done with writing down my two cents I’ll take a closer look at all the other reviews and hopefully will find out if anyone else has a similar opinion to mine. I mean don’t get me wrong, this was an enjoyable read and when I would have just gone with the flow and wouldn’t have thought about things too closely I probably would have been fine too. The problem is, I have experience with psychotherapists and worked with many of them over the years and I just couldn’t switch off the voice in the back of my mind that constantly told me: “No psychotherapist worth their salt would ever act like this or say something like that! This is a psychiatric ward! How can the doctors, nurses and therapists in there act like this?!” Not to mention all the plot holes I just couldn’t overlook and that could easily compete with Swiss cheese. But I’m getting ahead of myself here so let’s just start at the beginning. ”And if I’m going to be honest – and I may as well be – the real reason I agreed to keep this diary was to reassure him – prove that I’m okay. I can’t bear the thought of him worrying about me. I don’t ever want to cause him any distress or make him unhappy or cause him pain. I love Gabriel so much. He is without doubt the love of my life.”So for everyone who doesn’t know what the plot of “The Silent Patient” is about: Alicia Berenson is an artist who is found next to her husband’s body. He was shot five times, in his head, close range and Alicia is arrested for his murder. And you can already guess it from the title: She doesn’t speak a single word which doesn’t exactly help her case. All the evidence points at her being her husband’s murderer but no one knows why. They were a happy couple, at least on the outside. Fast forward seven years and Alicia is at a psychiatric ward; still not talking and her husband’s murder is still a mystery. Enter Theo Faber a forensic psychotherapist who thinks he might be the solution to all of Alicia’s problems. He will make her talk, he’ll be the one who gets through to her. He is the only one who can solve the mystery and save her! Can you already tell that I absolutely loved Theo?! He was such a sweetheart! ”Without wishing to sound boastful, I felt uniquely qualified to help Alicia Berenson. I’m a forensic psychotherapist, and used to working with some of the most damaged, vulnerable members of society. And something about Alicia’s story resonated with me personally – I felt a profound empathy with her right from the start.”No, just no. Theo was such a red flag, I can’t even! Aside of his huge ego and his stance about psychotherapists I just couldn’t get warm with his character. He was the embodiment of everything a psychotherapists shouldn’t be or do and the fact they allowed him to take over Alicia’s case showed how desperate they must have been. I mean he had only just changed his job and was already entrusted with a delicate case like Alicia’s?! Not a realistic scenario but apparently some sacrifices had to be made in order to keep the plot going. ”The real motivation was purely selfish. I was on a quest to help myself. I believe the same is true for most people who go into mental health. We are drawn to this particular profession because we are damaged – we study psychology to heal ourselves. Whether we are prepared to admit this or not is another question.”Urgh. As I said, I just couldn’t with Theo. We have a character who had a really horrible childhood with an abusive father and he is drawn to his patient because her childhood wasn’t any better than his. I don’t think I have to explain why this is no good idea. But then again, it didn’t seem like any of the other people who worked at The Grove knew what they were doing. Diomedes seemed like the fatherly head of the institute indulging Theo whenever he could, Yuri – one of the male nurses - was an extremely questionable character and don’t even get me started on Theo’s former colleague Christian. The only character who seemed to be a halfway decent psychotherapist was Indira and she was a caricature of an idealistic hippie. Also and I have to mention this here: I think there were some misogynistic vibes going on as well. At least I had the impression that women weren’t equal to men in this story. Why? Okay, let me explain. ”You are not the first. I believed I would succeed. Alicia is a silent siren, my boy, luring us to the rocks, where we dash our therapeutic ambition to pieces.” All of the patients in the psychiatric ward are female whereas most of the staff is male. Truth be told, the only female character of the staff was Indira and she was described as “a kindly therapist” quite literally from the moment she had the job interview with Theo. She’s basically the voice of reason drowned out by all her male colleagues throughout the entire book. Also how come there isn’t even a single mention of a male patient in that psychiatric ward? Are we back in the 19th century where every woman was diagnosed with hysterics? The author’s choice of almost all the staff being male is interesting as well, considering the fact that approximately about 60% of psychotherapists are actually female. Yet we have one female psychotherapist and only female patients. Boggles the mind. The continued use of the word “bitch” when referring to one of the patients or women in general was very questionable as well and the description of Theo’s own psychologist – an old woman named Ruth – well, she was the motherly kind that was all soft and sweet. And Theo’s wife Kathy?! Or the description of Alicia’s aunt, of Alicia’s friend Barbie?! It seems like we either have too soft/silly/dependent/pretty women or despicable/ugly “bitches” in this book. There’s no in between and I could go on and on but I think I’ll just leave it at that. ”I remember thinking, there’s no going back now. We were crashing through every last boundary between therapist and patient. And soon it would be impossible to tell who was who.”Theo – well, as I already said I had a lot of issues with his character and aside of the fact that he seemed to be pretty unhinged the story and some parts of the plot were extremely unrealistic. I honestly would have had to switch off my common sense in order to be able to accept some of the things that happened in here. Unfortunately I couldn’t, so here we are! And before I spoil anything now I’ll just make a spoiler warning and rant about all the unrealistic things that didn’t work for me and caused me to rate this book 2,5 stars. Okay, here goes nothing! ”I was in a state of shock. I knew I had to take a look at myself – or risk losing myself. Get a grip, I muttered under my breath as I rolled a joint.”I get why Theo was an unreliable and unhinged narrator, if he wouldn’t have been the revelations at the ending of the book wouldn’t have been possible, but seriously, there were so many things I just couldn’t wrap my head around. For one thing I found it extremely unrealistic that Theo cut his finger when he found out about Kathy’s affair. I mean yeah, okay, the fact he cut his finger on a shard of glass wasn’t unrealistic but it going unnoticed by Kathy and his co-workers was extremely unrealistic. He literally, and I’m quoting the book here sliced “a chunk of flesh from my finger”! There was blood everywhere, he held his finger up and rivulets of blood were running down his arms. No one can tell me that an injury like this would go unnoticed by so many people, especially not his wife! My hubby had an injury like that once and he bled so much even I was starting to feel uneasy and considered to go to the hospital. We literally had to bandage his finger so much that it looked like he had a cast on it. Kathy would have noticed. His co-workers would have noticed. Period. Second example: Paul Rose – Alicia’s cousin – clocks Theo with a baseball bat because he thought he was a burglar. So first thing first: Who on earth would clock a person with a baseball bat just because aforementioned person is standing in front of their house?! Like sure, we all go around with baseball bats and once a person is looking at my house the first thing I do is take it and bash their head in. We all do, right?! Completely normal behaviour! But if that wasn’t weird enough, Theo’s reaction to it is even more weird. I mean he literally passed out on the ground after that blow to his head, he had a concussion and probably needed to get stitches but what did he do? You definitely wouldn’t sue the person that hit you and you also wouldn’t go to a hospital because cheers, mate no harm done. It was all in good humour, right? Theo takes it like a champ, asks Paul some questions and then he goes home like nothing ever happened and even goes to work the next day. And once again: NO ONE NOTICES!!! Not Theo’s wife, not his co-workers, no one! Surely no one would notice a laceration on another person’s head! And of course Theo would be able to go about his normal business, because people with concussions are known to be completely steady on their feet and to have no headache! I had a mild concussion once, I spent the next week with the worst headache of my life, was completely unsteady on my feet, my circulation was extremely off and I threw up a couple of times. And unlike Theo I didn’t even have a laceration that bled, you couldn’t see anything from the outside. Is Theo Superman or what?! As I said plot holes like Swiss Cheese and unrealistic scenarios that could put every spy movie to shame. I could mention a couple of other things but I’ll just leave it at that and go to the most important thing: The ending!Oh boy! If you thought the things above were already unrealistic then you’re in for a treat because the ending is probably the most unrealistic thing about the entire book. So Theo’s wife Kathy had an affair with Alicia’s husband Gabriel. Nice. But the timelines are completely off and in the huge revelation at the ending we’re supposed to believe that all the things with Kathy’s infidelity happened around the same time Alicia wrote her diary. But 7 years passed between the murder and Theo’s therapy with Alicia. Yet the thing with Theo slicing his finger happened when he found out about Kathy’s infidelity, Paul Rose bashed his head in while Theo knew Kathy was having an affair. It just doesn’t add up. At least for me it doesn’t. I honestly would have to reread the book again to find out if it’s just my perception of things and events but to read “The Silent Patient” once was enough so I won’t do that. By reading it once the timelines just didn’t add up. But that’s not all, the way Alicia fell into a coma?! We’re supposed to believe that Alicia found out Theo was the one who caused her to murder her husband, because he revealed Gabriel’s infidelity to her. Even when Gabriel thought Alicia was going to die he didn’t offer his life for hers and couldn’t tell her he loved her which was the reason Alicia ended up killing him in the end. So far so good. But and here comes the long list of things that didn’t add up: We’re supposed to believe that Alicia was tied to a chair when Gabriel found her and that she tried to free herself. Surely there would have been wounds on her wrists and ankles when she fought against her restrains for hours, right?! But the police didn’t report anything even though they obviously took a look at her wrists because she tried to kill herself. Even with cut wrists you would have seen chafed skin! Not to mention the chafed skin on her ankles. Also why the hell wouldn’t Alicia talk about what happened! 7 years! 7 freaking years and she never uttered a single word. Why?! Sure you could say she was traumatized but the way it was described in the book she just did it out of spite. Because she didn’t want to talk about it?! I mean sure, let the world think you killed your husband for no reason, create a painting you name “Alcestis” and spend the rest of your days in a psychiatric ward where they pump you so full of medicine you can’t even think straight. We’d all prefer that to talking about it, right?! I’m supposed to believe Alicia didn’t talk out of spite? Instead of the logical conclusion that she was actually traumatized by the events?! Sure. Let’s just roll with it. Also how did the diary – the important plot device that’s giving us all the answers – even end up with Alicia in the psychiatric ward in the first place?! You’d think the police would have immediately confiscated it as evidence when they investigated Gabriel’s murder. How the hell did it get to Alicia without anyone checking its contents first? It would have helped A LOT in the investigation and at court. And last but not least: No one can tell me that Alicia wrote that entire last diary entry and even snuck into her atelier to hide the diary behind the painting. It’s just not possible. Not with a deadly dose of morphine running through her veins. She could not have done it! Theo injected her with a needle! It went directly into her blood stream and everyone who ever got an intravenous drip knows how fast they work. There is no way she could have written that super long and extremely coherent explanation into her diary, let alone hide it behind one of her paintings. I repeat there’s no way this could have worked. No way. Conclusion:Sorry for that salty spoiler part, but I just couldn’t with this. I mean this was an easy and fast read but I don’t really get the hype this book got. This was a #1 New York Times bestseller, mind you, but I honestly think there are better mystery thrillers out there. Was I entertained? Yes, I was. Was it the best book I ever read? Nope, definitely not. Maybe it’s just a case of “this book wasn’t for me”, I really dunno. All I know is that my common sense wasn’t fooled by this story and that a lot of things didn’t make any sense. At least not to me. Okay, my unpopular opinion time is over now. I’ll let myself out. ;-)_______________________________Oh, well. I think I’m going to be the an unpopular opinion here but uff.I know this is a mystery thriller and was a #1 New York Times bestseller and even though I was entertained, I still had my issues with the book. Lots of things happened in here so umm. I think I’ll have to write a long and elaborate review. Please bear with me. Full RTC soon! This is going to be interesting. _______________________________So #Rainboween is still going strong but I want to write my review for “Wolfsong” before I dive into “Ravensong” and because of that (and because I’m super slow with writing my reviews) I decided to go for another book first. *lol* V-logic! XD Anyway! I’ve heard so many good things about “The Silent Patient” and I think everybody and their grandma already read this story. I’m probably among the few people who still didn’t read the book so I’m going to rectify this now. I mean if Halloween month isn’t the perfect time to read a thriller then I don’t know! I’m very curious if I’ll like this one. Let’s find out. ;-)Find me on:My BlogInstagram"
114,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38946743-berit-talks-books,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book was... simply bRILLIANT! Fraught with tension and an urgency that made me fly through the story!This book has been billed as the “debut thriller of 2019“ and can I just say, it just might be! Bravo Alex Michealides! This was one heck of a debut! A well-crafted, perfectly paced story, that I believe will please even the pickiest thriller lover! This was a unique take on a psychological thriller, seriously the entire book was a twist, because I never knew in what direction it was going....Alicia has been convicted of shooting her husband five times in the face... she was discovered with the gun in hand, covered in blood, and did not offer up a word of defense... not only that she has not spoken a single word since the murder... she now resides at the Grove a psychiatric hospital in northern London.... Theo is a criminal psychotherapist who is obsessed with the mute Alicia... convinced he can get her to talk, he gets hired at the Grove and insists on treating her... why won’t Alicia talk? Why is Theo so obsessed? Why would a seemingly happy wife murder her husband? What really happened that night? These are just a few questions that ran through my head throughout this book...The story is primarily told from Theos point of view... although it is quite remarkable how much Alicia said with her silence... Theo is a complicated character in his own right, with troubles and issues of his own... we learned about Alicia and her marriage through Theos eyes, as he investigated and interviewed those that had known her and her husband Gabriel... we also got an even more personal glimpse into Alicia‘s psyche when she revealed her journal to Theo... nothing in this book was ever quite as it seemed....This was a complicated tale bursting with misdirection and an ending that will make you gasp! I was thinking what? How did I miss this? Someday time permitting I’d like to go back and read this again, and find the clues the author left behind, because I did not see that ending coming! Absolutely recommend this one should not be missed!🎧🎧🎧 I was fortunate enough to listen to this one on audio and can I just say it was stellar! Jack Hawkins did an amazing job of bringing the character of Theo to life, there really is nothing better than listening to a book that takes place in England with that posh English accent in your ear! Louise Brealey voiced Alicia, another English accent I could listen to all day. It was interesting because I was discussing this book with my mom who does not listen to audiobooks (shame on her) and I think the characters were so much more likable for me because I had more of a connection with them through their voices. Does this make sense? To clarify she love the book, I just think I saw some things a little differently because I had a little more of a personal connection. Audiobooks really do add another dimension to the story, in my humble opinion.🎵🎵🎵 song running through my head! OK I know this is not politically correct, but seriously this was the song running through my head during this book 🙃… See a clinic full of cynics Who want to twist the peoples' wrist They're watching every move we make We're all included on the list… The lunatics have taken over the asylum The lunatics have taken over the asylum… No nuclear the cowboy told us And who am I to disagree 'Cause when the madman flips the switch The nuclear will go for me… The lunatics have taken over the asylum The lunatics have taken over the asylum… I've seen the faces of starvation But I just can not see the points 'Cause there's so much food here today That no one wants to take away… The lunatics have taken over the asylum The lunatics have taken over the asylum The lunatics have taken over the asylum, take away my right to choose The lunatics…https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g0daraC...*** A huge thank you to Macmillan Audio for my copy of this book ***"

“Alicia is a silent siren, my boy, luring us to the rocks, where we dash our therapeutic ambition to pieces”
It's been 6 years since Gabriel Berrenson was shot by his wife. Alicia has not spoken a word since. The mystery of what happened has died down but not for Theo Faber, criminal psychotherapist. He is determined to help Alicia speak again and to finally find out the truth. 
“Choosing a lover is a lot like choosing a therapist. We need to ask ourselves, is this someone who will be honest with me, listen to criticism, admit making mistakes, and not promise the impossible?”
From the hype this book was receiving and the intriguing premise, I could not resist picking it up. It's been a while since I've read a good thriller and The Silent Patient was filled with all the good(?) stuff. I read this book in one night because I just NEEDED to know. The writing hooked me and the twist at the end was one I was not expecting. I'm going to end off here because I don't like to give away too much when I review thrillers. Wouldn't want to ruin anyone's experience : )I highly recommend 🌹 ______Buddy read with the power crew: Khadidja, Fares and Hamad 💜💜💜"

I liked that none of the characters are exactly who they seem to be on the surface, which makes the novel overall more compelling and intriguing.The plot is quite original and never slowed down for a second. If you think that it will suffer from one of the main characters being silent for the great majority of the book, then think again. The book's themes are deeply rooted in psychological pain and made me think about how our pasts shape us in ways that we might not even be conscious of on the surface. This is a fantastic debut and I look forward to reading additional books by this author in the future, especially if they are all as fresh and intricately twisty as this one.I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book from Bookish First and Netgalley.

No one knows why she does this or why she becomes mute after it. Was she unstable before she shot him? Or did someone else do the deed and she became so traumatized by the experience that she was not able to speak again?This is exactly what psychotherapist Theo Faber wants to know. He has waited six years for the opportunity to work with Alicia. He applies for a job at the Grove, the place were Alicia is a patient and thankfully, he gets it. He begins right away trying to get Alicia to open up to him. Theo hopes he can help her although everyone thinks it's a waste of time. Many have tried and they have all have failed. Can Theo be the one to break the cycle?The Silent Patient was everything I thought it was going to be for me. A page-turner, good writing, interesting characters, and an end with a good twist.Did I see it coming? My answer is a resounding yes. Yet, in a way, it took me completely by surprise.

It's hard to put into words, but a Psychotherapist quickly becomes attuned to recognizing mental distress, from physical behavior and speech and a glint in the eyes - something haunted, afraid, mad. And that's what bothered me: despite everything she had done, and endured, Alicia's blue eyes remained as clear and cloudless as a summer's day. She wasn't mad. So what was she? What was the expression in her eyes? ABOUT THIS BOOK: The Silent Patient is a shocking psychological thriller of a woman’s act of violence against her husband—and of the therapist obsessed with uncovering her motive…Alicia Berenson’s life is seemingly perfect. A famous painter married to an in-demand fashion photographer, she lives in a grand house with big windows overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. One evening her husband Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot, and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, and then never speaks another word.Alicia’s refusal to talk, or give any kind of explanation, turns a domestic tragedy into something far grander, a mystery that captures the public imagination and casts Alicia into notoriety. The price of her art skyrockets, and she, the silent patient, is hidden away from the tabloids and spotlight at the Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London.Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who has waited a long time for the opportunity to work with Alicia. His determination to get her to talk and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband takes him down a twisting path into his own motivations—a search for the truth that threatens to consume him.... MY THOUGHTS: I had a grandfather who was very fond of saying 'Believe nothing of what you hear, little of what you read, and only half of what you see.' And it applies perfectly to this book, which I devoured in less than twenty-four hours. And at the end, I sat like a stunned mullet thinking, 'What the? That shouldn't have worked.' But it did. Beautifully. The story is told mainly from Theo's point of view, with occasional flashbacks from Alicia and excerpts from her diary. I didn't like the characters. None of them. Well, except for Ruth. I thought Alicia a nervous ninny, Theo pompous and self-righteous, and don't even get me started on the supporting cast. But I couldn't put it down. And not once did I have any idea of the ending. Well done, Mr Michaelides. 💖💖💖💖💖THE AUTHOR: Born in Cyprus to a Greek-Cypriot father and English mother, I studied English literature at Cambridge University and got my MA in screenwriting at the American Film Institute in Los Angeles. I wrote the film The Devil You Know (2013) starring Rosamund Pike and co-wrote The Con is On (2018), starring Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Parker Posey and Sofia Vergara.

125,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30978160-meredith-trying-to-catch-up,Rating 2 out of 5,"Another Over-hyped “it’s all about the twist read” that fell short for me.The Silent Patient is a dark and twist-filled psychological thriller about a woman who stopped speaking the night her husband was murdered and the psychotherapist who treats her 6 years later.The plot: A psychotherapist’s interest with a patient borders on obsession. The patient does not speak. The psychotherapist believes he is the one who can get the silent patient to speak. Will he succeed? My frustrations stem from the narrative. The story is told primarily from Theo (the psychotherapist's perspective) woven in with Alicia’s (the silent patient) diaries. 
I love an unreliable narrator, but Theo lacked the intelligence and masterful skills to make this work.
 He had me rolling my eyes, laughing inappropriately, and groaning from frustration. I was often commenting in my head about what an idiot he was. Had his character been more developed and less obvious, I might have enjoyed this more.Here I go again ranting about yet another book I expected to love but I couldn't look past the cartoonish characters, poorly executed plot, and a twist that I could see from a mile away. While I liked the premise, ultimately The Silent Patient was a failure for me. "

She was accused of unexpectedly murdering her husband and hasn’t spoken since, causing people to firmly believe she is guilty. But Theo is Team Alicia, and believes he can get the truth for her, even if it requires him to go to unethical lengths to get there.  I appreciated that the author commented that he didn't write this as a thriller although that's what his publishers categorized it as. I agree with the author - this is simply good old fiction and not a thriller. The buildup to the reveal of this work was much too slow to be suspenseful, especially as all the action took place off page. The characters felt a little flat to me as well – they were good enough to not detract from the read, but not dynamic enough to really draw me in to them and their relationships. The premise was interesting and gave me high hopes for this read. There were also many red herrings included throughout the book, making it difficult to know exactly where this was going for much of the book. While I did like their inclusion as it kept me guessing and rounded out Alicia’s life, most of them weren’t resolved or addressed in any real way, which made them feel a little cheap. There were many things while I was reading that I felt didn’t make sense, and by the end of the book several of them were explained by the final resolution though there were also several that weren’t. I did quite like the ending, though. This was entertaining overall, though I did find it to be somewhat average. "

With that said, this book will still kind of middle-of-the-road for me. If you remove the extraordinary twist, you are left with a strange story that suddenly doesn't quite make sense with characters that behave in ways that are illogical at best. Suspension of disbelief is definitely needed. And yet, like I said, I still found myself very drawn into the story, it was definitely a 'page turner' (I listened to the audiobook), and the cast of characters/suspects did feel pretty fleshed out (up to a point) so that's why I rounded this up to four stars. I'd definitely read something else by this author. "

131,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22257790-linzie-suspenseisthrillingme,Rating 5 out of 5,"Six years ago, after Alicia Berenson’s fashion photographer husband, Gabriel, got home late one night from a shoot, she fired five bullets into his face. From that moment on, she uttered not another word—refusing to confess or claim her innocence in his murder. A well-respected painter, she has always spoken through her art, so it was hardly surprising that her lone statement was a self-portrait painted after the fact. Through it, however, the public saw a monster. A monster who couldn’t be anything but guilty.Unwilling—or unable—to speak up for herself, Alicia is trundled off to a secure forensic unit in London. Once at the Grove, the silent patient’s muteness leaves the staff with few options to help her recover and instead drug her into a deep stupor. As the world continues to move on without her, Alicia’s art becomes highly sought after just as she sinks further into oblivion.Meanwhile, the mystery of why Alicia won’t speak has captivated Theo Faber. A criminal psychotherapist, he has a strong desire to help this poor lost soul. Granted, there’s a part of himself that also wants to know the why to Alicia’s crime, but all of that takes a back seat to the empathy he feels deep in his bones. So much so, in fact, that he leaves his much lauded position at another hospital in order to hopefully counsel Alicia himself.Joining her care team, however, is the easy part, because, in order to solve the ultimate mystery, Theo will have to reevaluate his own motivations. After all, this isn’t just any old case and Alicia isn’t just any old patient—she’s the holy grail of psychotherapy who echoes his own anguish at times. Step by step, he digs for the truth as he becomes consumed in his quest. What hasn’t dawned on him yet, however, is what if he doesn’t like what he finds? Will Alicia’s answers be more than he can handle in the end?Phew. For a majorly hyped up book like The Silent Patient, I had high expectations. You’ll be happy to hear, then, that it did not disappoint in the least. After all, between its jaw-dropping twist, perfectly plotted storyline, and the deep topics at play, there wasn’t much there not to love. What absolutely blew me away, however, was the fact that despite my voracious love for anything thriller, I didn’t for a second see where this plot was headed, which is the ultimate proof of how brilliant the ineffable Alex Michaelides truly is.Drilling down on that twist to end all twists, I can only compare it to the likes of The Wife Between Us, Gone Girl, or Rock Paper Scissors. If you’ve read any of the above, then you know that those are not plot twists to be taken lightly. No, they’re the kind that have you rereading sentences and flipping back to prior pages because what you’re seeing just can’t be right. Well, this one was no different and had me shouting “Wait, WHAT?!” louder than I probably should’ve. I can’t say much more or I’ll be sure to spoil it for you. Needless to say, though, I’d be shocked if you could see even a glimmer of this one coming. I don’t care how many thrillers you’ve inhaled in the past, this is one for the books—take it from someone who imbibes on nothing but…Then there were the truly top-notch characters. Fully fleshed out and with deep backstories that magically revealed crystal clear pasts, they had me in the palm of their hands. I was absorbed in their dilemmas and rooted for most of them, even if a couple were somewhat morally gray. Not one individual and their carefully crafted identities let me down, and that’s always something to behold, so bravo, Mr. Michaelides.Finally, I was enraptured with the plot itself. A slow burn psychological suspense novel that was complex and multi-layered, absolutely nothing was as it seemed. With plenty of deviously obscured clues and the perfect number of red herrings, my attention was waylaid more than once. That’s not to say it was too much. Oh no. This storyline was the last bowl of oatmeal for Goldilocks all the way—it was just right.Ultimately, The Silent Patient was the epitome of an addictive page-turner. I mean, the pacing itself drew me in deep and I found an excuse to read just one more chapter more times than I could count. Quite frankly, I’m shocked that this was the author’s debut. Between the engaging dialogue and delicious journal entries, I’m already itching to get my hands on his newest novel, The Fury. So if you’re like me and somehow failed to read this one when it was released, be sure to add it to your TBR right away. It’s just not one to be missed.

132,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42055091-dilushani-jayalath,Rating 5 out of 5,"I have, not the slightest clue, as to why I have been putting off reading this book. Mostly because I was scared that my expectations would not be met (as it has been with many books) but it seemed as if I had nothing to worry. This book, once it hooked its talons in me managed to keep me up the night waiting to be finished. Each chapter I would make a note on what I thought happened, each page turned made my heart beat faster, my hands clammy. I sensed a fear crawling in my heart. If I have to confess as to what book has scared me, it would be no horror books I have read but this. The lengths human minds go, it is scary. The lengths how our thoughts befuddle us and how a single tiny thought completely pushes us off course? This scares me. Now I know what I am scared of. Thoughts. They scare me. Not humans but the barrage of unfiltered thoughts that run across the human mind, that is like a ticking bomb. This scares me. It scares me the most because I do not know when even I, myself could be victim to this. It is true. What everyone says about this book. It stays with you. It is one of the BEST thrillers in the contemporary literary world. The climax will leave you gratified with the twist or like in my case, slightly trembling. Either ways, it will stay with you. Alex Michaelides has gifted us with a masterpiece. Do not waste your time not reading this. This book made me fear humans but mostly it made me fear myself. I honestly do not know why it made me do that. In a way in the retrospect how Alicia could not trust her own thoughts made me think, how can I trust my own self? Never in my life, through the countless books I’ve read, that has made me unsure of myself like this. This is not emotion I am happy or glad with. In a way this is an excellent outlook of human mind, mental illness and psychology. A perfect book with a combination to doubt every step taken by the characters. There are no good or bad characters here. Well, I take that back. I think there are no good characters here. Just a mirror of how people are in the current society. This is the truth and in my opinion? A truth we should fear."

I also loved that I wasn't reading pages and pages totally unrelated to the mystery, which happens in a lot of mysteries and is one aspect I have issues with in the genre. And the twist at the end was something I just did not anticipate. Not a favorite, but definitely worth reading."
135,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6658001-terence-m---quot-libros-quam-breve-tempus,Rating 1 out of 5,"Audiobook - 08:33 hours - Narrators: Louise Brealey, Jack HawkinsPlease Note: 1-Star (I did not like it). (Late edit 21/06/21)Generally I ignore a publisher's blurb, but not as much as I ignore any well-known authors' glitzy endorsements. So, who or what to believe? First of all, since 2011, the reviews of my Goodreads friends and those I follow are the first and main sources of recommendation for me. I rarely read any review from go to whoa, relying on stars ratings and brief scans of the written review to decide whether or not I will buy and listen to any particular book. Second of all... well, there really is no 'second of all' other than the reviews by other Goodreads members who are not my friends or whom I do not follow.""The Silent Patient"" was awarded 5 Stars, 4 Stars, and several telling 3 Stars, by Friends and Followed, so I had my hopes for a decent read/listen. Well into the book, I had been more-or-less struggling with the plot/story line of The Silent Patient and I had some questions about the credibility of the existence of ""The Grove"", a supposedly high security facility for dangerous, mentally ill patients and the way it was 'managed', including the behaviour of The Grove's 'highly qualified' staff. 'The Big Twist' - an over-used, abused and usually untrue accolade has been given to more thrillers than I have had meat pies with tomato sauce - an Aussie staple for the past gazillion years! To be honest, I didn't pick it and this is pretty normal for me, but it did leave me a bit goggle-eared, so what I did do was go back to about half-way through the audiobook and listened to the second half again, in one fell swoop. Aside from suffering from a lack of sleep, I felt no more enlightened than I was after listening to it for the first time.I didn't feel attracted to any of the book's characters and several of them were downright annoying. I didn't like the structure of the book with its two narrators and I didn't like the actual narration much either. Protag #1 tended to gabble at times and Protag #2 sounded (eventually) suspiciously 'wussy' and weak-willed, which she obviously wasn't, so overall two pretty ordinary renditions by Jack Hawkins and Louise Brealey.What did I like about the book? Not much really. I was determined to finish it and I listened attentively most of the time, particularly through my second listening. I think the writing was bland and cliched which contributed to a pretty ordinary listening experience.Some books do not deserve to be scuttled by a 1 Star (I didn't like it) award, nor do they deserve a 3 Star (I liked it) award, so from me, The Silent Patient gets 2 Stars (It was ok)1-Star (I did not like it).

136,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365405-james,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Silent Patient is the debut novel written by Alex Michaelides in 2019. I regularly read thrillers, suspense novels, and mysteries, but this book was selected by my blog followers through the Book Bucket List feature I hold monthly. It was the March 2020 winner, so I've gotten the book and read it this week. I began and finished it over three hours in a single sitting, and I highly recommend you do the same thing.Let's begin with the plot: Theo is a psychotherapist. He's fascinated by the Alicia Berenson case. She supposedly killed her husband and has refused to speak for years, ever since being put in an institution. Theo ends up working at the same building, and he's assigned to her case, but the institute's administration is failing and the place will likely be shut down. The story intertwines between Theo's work with Alicia, Alicia's diaries and life before the murder, and Theo's personal life with his wife. In between, we meet other patients, a few doctors, the various family members in Alicia's and her late husband's lives, and a critical neighbor or two. One of these people knows a secret, but we can't quite tell who will figure out how to stay hidden.Did Alicia murder her husband? Is someone intentionally keeping her medicated to prevent the truth from coming out? Are others in danger? This book cleverly provides a few twists and turns like any traditional psychological thriller, and I thoroughly enjoyed the ride. It's the perfect novel I want to read. I knew from the beginning that we were being misled, but it could've been in a few different manners. I'm happy to say I predicting 50% of the secrets, but I hadn't predicted the remaining 50%. I suppose that's how the author planned part of it... and I'm glad to follow his clues. I felt fully captivated by the story, despite a couple of minor holes... to me folks, this is fiction, and the point of reading it is to go a little outside our bounds. It's rare to find a new plot, so authors have to play a bit with reality and the law. I'm totally okay with that.I'd say this winds up between 4.5 and 5 stars because of how well it engaged me. The writing was good. I roll my eyes at those who complain about it... they just like to complain, so I ignore them. It's a thriller, I'm looking for something solid and meandering, and this is exactly it. I recommend it to those looking for a fun suspense that isn't about chasing a killer... it's purely about finding the truth without a sleuth or a detective involved in the game. I'm quite happy this one the contest... so now what will I add to my Book Bucket List in its place?"

138,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4876540-jonetta,Rating 4 out of 5,"Six years ago, Alicia Berenson shot her husband, Gabe, six times in the face. She was 33-years old at the time, a successful artist and he a renowned fashion designer. She’s not said a word since, even during her trial, and now resides at a private mental facility called The Grove. Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who is fascinated by her case and maneuvers his career to get hired on at The Grove because he believes he understands her and can help break her silence. No one has ever been able to determine any motive for her having killed her husband as everyone believed them to be a loving couple with a solid and healthy relationship. Theo and Alicia provide the narratives for this story, hers delivered through diary entries from the time before Gabe’s murder. We rely on Theo to give us the present day aspects of the story as he works to solve the mystery of what happened that day and help release Alicia from her mental prison. There are a host of characters who were part of Alicia’s and Gabe’s lives that are questionable, in the sense that their relationships with the couple may not have been as it seemed outwardly. All this has the effect of me questioning everyone and everything, what are the truths and what was smoke. Even Alicia’s hand in her husband’s death is in question. I was off balance from the start of this story, primarily because I found both narrators to be unreliable as Theo comes with his own baggage, and it was difficult to sift through the truths. Yes, there are stunning twists in this story but it has that impact solely because of the strong character development and storytelling delivered up to those points. If you pay careful attention, however, it all makes perfect sense. I enjoyed this story, especially having listened to it as the two narrators delivered outstanding performances. They both knew how to portray their main characters and tell their stories. It was a well done listening experience. I’m also impressed that this is a debut novel and liked its connection to one of Euripides’ Greek tragedies. I highly recommend this story and be prepared for a classic psychological mind twister.Posted on Blue Mood Café"

Pero es una novela “tramposa”, como suelen serlo las de este tipo de tramas. Y si has leído unas cuantas, no te resultará muy difícil adivinar por dónde van los tiros. Mucho antes de lo que el autor pretende que lo hagas, sin duda. ¿Está bien escrita? Sí, si no eres demasiado exigente. ¿Es interesante? Bastante. ¿Engancha? Depende, si te dejas embaucar por el artificioso argumento, seguro que sí. ¿Está bien resuelta? Puf, permitidme que no me pronuncie abiertamente, a pesar de haber intuido el final con bastante antelación. Es un thriller psicológico que, como entretenimiento, funciona con fluidez.

But I’ve always admired the ability to think 10 moves ahead when faced with a worthy opponent. Here we have 2 well matched MC’s, each with a plan & motive that may end up being their downfall.Alicia Berenson used to be one half of a glamorous couple. She was a beautiful, successful artist deeply in love with her husband Gabriel. Which of course begs the question…why did she shoot him in the face 5X? You’ll have to come to your own conclusions because Alicia’s not talking. At all.Not to the police & not to her lawyer during a well publicized trial. Her cool, silent demeanor earned her a verdict of diminished capacity plus a spot at The Grove, a secure psychiatric facility in London. Several years on nothing much has changed. Despite the best efforts of medical staff, Alicia remains mute. But one man believes he can get her to tell her story & he’s about to get his chance.Dr. Theo Faber followed the trial with interest. As a criminal psychotherapist, he became fascinated with the beautiful woman who wouldn’t speak. So when a job comes up at the Grove, Theo jumps at the opportunity to treat its most famous resident. Pull up a chair, dust off the chess board & let the games begin.There are many secondary characters that add depth to the story. Some pop up briefly, several have recurring roles & others lurk in the background. Each brings something to the table, even in their absence. But make no mistake…this is the Alicia & Theo Show.Alicia is an enigma from the start. In the present, she is a shadow of her previous self. But through her thoughts & memories, we begin to put flesh on her bones as we learn about her childhood & subsequent relationship with Gabriel. Friends & colleagues chime in with their observations & put a slightly different slant on her perfect life. Whatever your impression of her, one thing is clear…her voice may be lost but there is absolutely nothing wrong with her mind. It’s up to Theo to carry the conversation during their regular sessions. And initially he’s more than up for the task. It’s not just about the satisfaction of helping a damaged soul. He’s well aware his colleagues have tried & failed to reach Alicia. If he can get her to speak, it would mean validation of his abilities & a huge feather in his cap. As time goes by, we watch as he becomes obsessed with cracking his famous patient & desperation leads to questionable judgement on his part. You begin to wonder if its a quest for professional glory or a classic case of hubris. From the opening pages I knew that even if this was a poorly written hot mess (it’s not), I would read to the final page because I had to understand why Gabriel was snuffed in such convincing fashion. It’s one of those books where it’s best to go in blind. Although this is a first novel, the author has written screen plays & it definitely shows in the expert pacing & story telling. I can easily imagine this as a film. I had my suspicions about Gabriel’s death but the motive is only revealed near the end. And what an end it is. There’s something really satisfying about a character getting what they so karmically deserve. If you’re a fan of psychological suspense, don’t hesitate to add this to your groaning TBR pile."

The very first chapter opens with Alicia Berenson standing in her living room covered in blood. There is blood on the walls and the floors and all over her. She is standing in front of a chair that her husband is sitting in, with his face blown off. He has been shot 5 times in the face at close range. His wrists and ankles bound with wire. Alicia is bleeding from both wrists that have been slashed. How is that for an opening? I bet that would get your attention. Well it sure got mine. Alicia was 33 yrs old at the time and a rising star as a painter. Her husband Gabriel was a 44 year old photographer who was well sought out. He had just returned home late from a photo shoot. Why did Alicia do it? Nobody knows, but there is no other suspect, her prints were all over everything. The thing is...she never spoke a word. For 6 long years after her husband was murdered, she kept silent. Is Alicia capable of this violence? Why is she silent? Everyone has long given up on her. Until the new psychotherapist rolls onto the scene. Theo Faber is the new psychotherapist hired by The Grove, the facility Alicia is in. Can he break her silence? Can he win her over? Everyone tells him to forget it, that she is a lost cause. Is she silent out of guilt or is she covering for someone else? Or has she simply lost her mind?This book blew my mind. Watch out 2019 The Silent Patient is coming. It literally left me speechless, no pun intended. I really can't say much more because I don't want to spoil it for anyone. Just know I gasped and said ""WHAT?!!!"" I never saw it coming. I am going to bet you won't either. Will we ever hear Alicia speak again? If so, what could she possibly have to say?This is a MUST read in my opinion. It was absolutely a phenomenal unique read! If I could give it more than 5 stars I would!Thank you so much Alex Michaelides, Orion Books and Poppy Stimpson for giving me the opportunity to read this ARC."

It is set to be a page-turner as you’re curious to know what happens at the end. However, the thrill wasn’t enough, you dont get much out of the characters and the story.

So, if you have time to kill, like you are waiting for some important test results or for your kid to find their shoes so you can leave the house, this will make the time go by quickly.The story is a first-person narration from a psychotherapist named Theo. We also get intermittent diary entries from his patient, Alicia to get her POV because she is ""The Silent Patient"" and therefore doesn't talk. (Love, Captain Obvious). So, Alicia killed her husband 6 years prior and was committed to a mental hospital. She has never spoken a word in that 6 years and this made Theo really intrigued by her case. He applies for a job in the facility where she is being held because he feels like he could help her. He wants to be the one who gets her to talk finally. But, when he gets there, he finds out that she is more than just quiet, she is also prone to attacking people and trying to kill them. You know, like a crazy murderer might do?Hmm, that's true. Those Low-Carb people will cut a bitch. If I were Theo, I would have brought a Snickers, cuz those things are like magic when someone is hangry.As Theo is trying to unlock Alicia's story, we are getting his story and you begin to wonder a couple of things:1. Is he crazy too? Is he on a low-carb diet?and2. Is he in love with her or something? He seems a little TOO sympathetic to the crazy killer lady.Seriously. These two need a Cinnabun STAT!But then comes ""the twist"".... dun dun dun...Yeah, it was worth the build-up.

A book that speaks about feelings, and lack of them. Love and emotions. Art and passion. Psychology and memories. And how our childhood might define who we will become.
I have never felt such urgency to read another chapter as I have felt it with The Silent Patient. Such impatience, such excitement. It’s a feeling I wish I can get with all the books in my life. ALICIAAlicia Berenson writes a diary as a release, an outlet – and to prove to her beloved husband that everything is fine. She can’t bear the thought of worrying Gabriel, or causing him pain.Until, late one evening, Alicia shoots Gabriel five times and then never speaks another word.THEOForensic psychotherapist Theo Faber is convinced he can successfully treat Alicia, where all others have failed. Obsessed with investigating her crime, his discoveries suggest Alicia’s silence goes far deeper than he first thought.And if she speaks, would he want to hear the truth? I love these types of books. Besides the mystery and thriller, the psychological part was an incredibly well-put together piece of art.The beginning of the story is nice and slow, but with a temptation in it, that makes you flip the pages so fast. A great world and character building, and great character hopping from Theo to Alicia, from chapter to chapter.Even though we don’t get to have Alicia talking in the book, she says so much. All her movements, all her reactions, or lack of reaction is so well written. Her lack of speaking doesn’t stop her from moving the story forward, and being the main protagonist here.On the other hand, we have Theo, who we see and get to know more and more with each chapter. A complicated character, with a cute oddness to himself, a characteristic I find with many psychotherapists. He is the person we see at the front of the screen, presenting himself in the spotlight, together with Alicia.
A well-written plot, with an amazing cliff-hanger and a wonderful plot-twist in the end. I didn’t expect it, and I am awfully satisfied of how the authors decides to conclude the book.
I enjoyed this book so much, and I recommend it to all the psychological thriller book readers here. Don’t miss this one, and get your copy today.

Is she guilty or what? Can Theo solve the mystery?LOVED it! So good! I can’t believe it’s the author's debut novel! And no, I couldn’t guess it! actually, I was shocked after finding the truth. Loved the writing style. It grabbed me from the first chapter. Told in dual POV, 1st person. It’s a standalone novel.

150,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5898724-chris-lee,Rating 3 out of 5,"A murder, a psychiatric hospital, and plenty of drama. The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides is a psychological thriller through and through. After being booked for the murder of her husband, Alicia is sent off to the Grove mental hospital for treatment. There, she is heavily medicated, does not respond well to the program, and, more curiously, refuses to speak to anyone. (Hence the title of the book.) Enter Theo, a psychiatrist who has sought a job at the Grove so he can personally treat the hospitalized artist. The current psychiatric team has all but given up trying to treat her, so letting Theo have a go may be the last hope of saving her sanity and finding out why she committed such a heinous act. I enjoy a slow-burn thriller, but the story and the character development were a bit too sparse for me; most of the patient treatments were head-scratchingly unprofessional; and the drama felt very much like a soap opera. That being said, I do believe the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.It might not reach the same heights as a similar Christie novel or do much for me, but it had its moments and might just wiggle its way into your psyche.🎵|

It has such a substantial twist that it’s hard to talk about the book without avoiding spoilers. But I’ll try. The Silent Patient follows psychotherapist, Theo. Theo has signed up to be Alicia Berenson’s therapist. Alicia Berenson was once a famous and successful painter, married to an equally successful photographer. One night, Alicia shoots her husband in the head, murdering him. Years later, Alicia is in a psychiatric hospital and hasn’t spoken a word. Theo’s mission is to uncover the truth of what happened that fateful night. I want to address the hype surrounding this book. It’s not warranted but it’s not unwarranted either. For a debut, this was amazing. It was extremely well written and the pacing was perfect.  I also wanted to mention the psychiatric hospital shown in this novel. Most books that I’ve read don’t realistically show what psych hospitals are like. This one was on point. And though every hospital is different, this was pretty accurate. Finally, I just wanted to say that the plot twist is super creative and even though I did figure it out before it was revealed, it was super twisty.  Overall, this book isn’t nearly as overhyped as I expected but it wasn’t the pure gold that everyone made it out to be.

As an English teacher I’m not evaluating this one on literary merit - this one is pure, wicked-good entertainment and Ddddaaaaaaaaaammn it doesn’t get much better.I avoided all reviews on this book once I realized it was an “IT” book to read, and so happy I did.

3 SOLID STARS.My boy, AJ FINN, author of The Woman in the Window, blurbed this book. And I was hyped. Ultimately, not even a well furnished quote from one of my favorite go-to-thriller authors wasn't able to save this mess. Even when sis snapped with a shocking and explosive twist I NEVER coming, I still was exasperated about the whole book overall. The writing.....wasn't really my cup of tea. I'll give you the tea: I couldn't connect with any of the characters and another tantalizing thought occurred to me while reading this, mostly concerning the male characters: almost every single one them.....not all but close enough... all the male characters were all sooo—'handsome' or 'good-looking' by the author. It was kinda funny actually. But describing the women's features and descriptions, they were either unattractive or ditzy, or a hardass, or a crazy, and in another aspect, 'heavily overweight'. It was just a distinctive line between male and female characters that felt unrealistic, untrue, and unimaginative. Opposite. But pretty much every single male character in this book was really just— an asshole. Not a single redeemable quality about any of them so maybe that was the whole point all along. The story itself is very, very slow burn. Like watching a candle burn and all the wax melting....but with a dying fire. It was almost infuriating to read and watch everything unfold until—That. Fucking. Twist.Holy fuck was it a game changer. Honestly, if my expectations weren't so barren and low by the time I got to that point in the book, I think I probably wouldn't be as shocked. But my guard was down—probably intentional on the author's part— and it was.......holy shit I was so, so shocked. The whole book overall isn't bad. But it wasn't that great either. But to say in the least, I'm giving it a solid three. It wasn't for me per say even though I understand that high rating and its reviews of five stars. I think if you like slow burns and explosive endings, then this might be for you. I was going to bump it up to a four after that, but I'm staying steadfast and sticking it a solid 3. No more. No less. Twitter | Bookstagram | Youtube |"
161,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/172628061-flo-camus,Rating 5 out of 5,"[5.0⭐] 𝙇𝙖 𝙥𝙖𝙘𝙞𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙚 𝙨𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙞𝙤𝙨𝙖 es una novela de suspenso psicológico escrita en 2019 por Alex Michaelides. Recibió el premio Goodreads Choice Award en 2019 y será adaptada cinematográficamente por la productora de Brad Pitt.La historia está narrada desde el punto de vista de Theo Faber, un psicoterapeuta inglés, que decide irse a trabajar al mismo hospital psiquiátrico (The Grove) en el que se encuentra Alice Berenson. Esta muchacha era una reconocida pintora que, un día, decidió disparar cinco tiros en la cabeza a su marido y no volvió a hablar. El señor Faber buscará desentrañar con todos sus medios este misterio. Poco a poco, va a ir obsesionándose con el caso hasta ir enredándose cada vez más con su paciente. La aglomeración de incógnitas que este libro deja desde el inicio es lo que cautivará a todo el público: ¿Qué pasó? ¿Por qué lo hizo? ¿Realmente es culpable? ¿Por qué no habla? ¿Llegará a hablar? Y, si habla, ¿contará lo que sucedió?Es un libro sumamente atrapante y del que casi todos hemos llegado a escuchar. La gente no para de hablar de él porque es la historia que está “de moda” entre los lectores amantes del misterio. Se puede ver una fuerte influencia por parte de Agatha Christie en cuanto a su narrativa y su estructura, algo que, como amante de Christie, no he podido pasar por alto (y que me ha encantado). Además, otra gran inspiración es 𝘼𝙡𝙘𝙚𝙨𝙩𝙞𝙨 de Eurípides, una obra a la que no le presté tanta atención cuando la vi en mi clase de “Literatura griega antigua”: tal y como lo dice el autor, uno la pasa por alto al tratarse de temas más internos de la cultura griega. Me ha encantado que se haya inspirado en los elementos más importantes de este clásico antiguo y que haya vuelto a poner a Eurípides en la boca de todos (me impactó leer a varios individuos mencionar que nunca habían escuchado hablar de este gran poeta trágico). Me encanta que la literatura actual siga recurriendo a los clásicos y que se culturice a las nuevas generaciones. Como se ha mencionado con anterioridad, esta obra es cautivadora y adictiva. Estoy más que segura de que cualquier lector se la devorará en cuanto la tenga en sus manos. Tiene una trama que te atrapa desde el primer momento; cualquiera quisiera investigar qué sucedió y el porqué. El misterio siempre se encuentra presente mientras estamos en la piel de Theo; hasta cuando intercala la historia con su vida personal seguimos presenciando ese aire de suspenso. Varios personajes llegan a parecer sospechosos y uno comienza a dudar de todos los individuos que se encontraban en la vida de Alice. El terapeuta será el encargado de ir entrevistando a cada persona que conocía a la pintora para poder desentrañar de una vez por todas el misterio que se esconde y, además, poder conocer de primera fuente cómo era la muchacha y qué estaba escondiendo. Poco a poco, el protagonista se verá completamente involucrado en la vida de la joven y se convertirá en un verdadero desafío el tener que lidiar con sus compañeros de trabajo ya que hay algunos que no comparten sus métodos. Además, será juzgado por la cercanía que va creando con la silenciosa paciente. Admito que llegué a descubrir el ‘plot twist’ y el misterio que rodeaba toda la historia desde la mitad del libro (por la constante mención de 𝘼𝙡𝙘𝙚𝙨𝙩𝙞𝙨 y la vida de Theo), pero puede que sea por todas las obras, películas y series policíacas que he consumido a lo largo de mi vida (es el género predilecto de mis dos padres, así que estoy completamente acostumbrada). Por otro lado, para un individuo que no está tan familiarizado con lo policial, considero que tiene un muy buen desenlace y una grata resolución del problema. Es algo que no a muchos se les vendrá a la cabeza y estoy segura de que quedarán completamente impactados con el final.Finalmente, puedo decir que es un libro realmente entretenido y que me ha fascinado por completo. Soy una gran amante de los trágicos griegos y disfruté mucho esta constante mención a Eurípides. Me ha llenado por completo el corazón y me ha hecho leer 𝘼𝙡𝙘𝙚𝙨𝙩𝙞𝙨, una obra que conocía y que tenía pendiente por ser la obra conservada más antigua de este gran autor. Volví a encontrar mi amor hacia el teatro con esta historia y estoy más que segura que, a lo largo de este año, me verán leyendo más clásicos teatrales. Una historia cargada de misterio y tragedia, en donde se tendrá a un lector atento y reflexivo que buscará desenterrar el pasado y desentrañar este misterio. Les prometo que tendrán una nueva adicción y que no podrán parar de leer."

The blood flow to all the other elements - narrative, all other supporting strands of plot, characterization, verisimilitude, believability of motivations - is cut off, so that oxygen and nutrients are directed solely toward the Twist. It grows, like a tumor, and finally at the end it's so big and deadly that it kills the novel, which has really been dying all along.Not for one second did I believe that the primary characters were real humans. None of their words, acts, or motivations emanated from a human consciousnesses. Your dog is more human than these humanoids. Probably so is your toaster.Possibly there were some vaguely realistic actions in the criminal mental hospital - the author worked at one for a few years. But he doesn't know any artists - the ""silent patient,"" Alicia, a famous artist, paints realistic paintings - scenes, with people - but she doesn't sketch on the canvas first. She just starts right in with her brush and oil paint.You will also have to suspend belief as you read Alicia's diary, since it comes complete with dialogue tags. ""Where do you want to go?"" I asked. ""Three guesses."" ""I want to paint you,"" I said. ""Again? You already did."" ""That was four years ago."" Then there's the diary entry where Alicia's house is being broken into by an intruder, but she can't stop recording the event.I can hear him - downstairs - he's trying the windows, and the doors. He's trying to get in.I need to get out of here. I need to escape.  [Maybe putting down your pen and running would help? Just a thought.]Oh my God - I can hear him -He's inside.He's inside the house.In the Acknowledgments the author thanks Uma Thurman ""for making me a better writer."" I'd like to thank Jennifer Aniston for helping me write this review, especially the punctuation."

I definitely understand why this is so popular and it is a really good thriller- but it was just not a personal fav of mine 🫤🫤 I liked it and had a good time reading it, but it just wasn't as amazing as i thought it would be 🤷‍♀️“...we often mistake love for fireworks - for drama and dysfunction. But real love is very quiet, very still. It's boring, if seen from the perspective of high drama. Love is deep and calm - and constant.”The Silent Patient is about Alicia Berenson, who lives a seemingly perfect life- until one day, she shoots her husband five times in the head. Since then she has not spoken a single word. It's now six years later and a psychotherapist is determined to get her to speak and finally figure out what happened that fateful night.“Remember, love that doesn't include honesty doesn't deserve to be called love.”This book is honestly one of the most hyped up thrillers- i have just seen nonstop good things- and i have been wanting to read it for so long. I'm kinda disappointed i didn't absolutely love it, but it was still a solid read 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️Let's start with what I enjoyed!! ✨️I must say that this is definitely a very good thriller. The storyline is so so interesting and the way the story develops is done really well- i liked how you were given a lot of the pieces but it was hard to see how they all fit together. It was really intriguing and i thought the way that all built up to the end was done super well 🤩🤩 Although i was a little uninterested at the beginning, once i was past a certain point, I couldn't put it down! 🥰The ending was also really good 🫶🫶 The most shocking thing i have ever read in my life? No. But it still caught me off guard and the way it was revealed was done well. I definitely understand why so many people raved about this now.“We're all crazy, I believe, just in different ways.”However, there were just a few things that made this not a fav for me 🫤 I think my main issue with this book was the writing style. I'm typically not that picky with writing but something about this author's writing style... i just couldn't do it 🙈🙈 I was just NOT vibing with it and that made enjoying my reading experience a bit difficult 😬😬I do also feel like the pacing was a bit inconsistent. Although i was bingeing it at the end, it started off really slow for me and getting to the interesting parts was a bit hard 😕“Choosing a lover is a lot like choosing a therapist. We need to ask ourselves, is this someone who will be honest with me, listen to criticism, admit making mistakes, and not promise the impossible?”Overall, I personally think it's a bit overrated but that's just my opinion!! I would still recommend it if you want:✔ Good psychological thriller✔ Shocking twist✔ Bingeable storyIt was pretty good 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️《 2023 Challenge: Book 106 of 110 》~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I can acknowledge that this was a really good thriller and the ending was definitely CRAZY- but it wasn't a personal fav of mine 😬😬 I just couldn't do it with the writing style 🙈Please don't come for me 😭😭RTC!"
166,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Silent Patient was a clever page turner. What more can you ask for in a psychological thriller? Theo is a psychotherapist. He goes to work in a psychiatric care facility for the purpose of working with Alicia. Alicia was found guilty of killing her husband, and she has not spoken a single word since he died or in her own defence. Theo sees Alicia as a challenge. Meanwhile, Theo discovers that his wife is having an affair. And saying more would be saying too much. This psychological thriller is very readable — clever without much explicit violence. And I was completely taken by surprise by the big twist at the end. Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy."
167,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14045562-amy,Rating 5 out of 5,"If you're at all involved in the bookish community there is simply no way that this book has flown under your radar, it's been talked about for months now, it's been literally everywhere and rightly so. It has such a clever premise and was executed flawlessly, it truly is a must read for psychological thriller fans.What can I really say about this one that hasn't been said a hundred times already?! Probably nothing new, but I'm going to say it all anyway because it's that good. The structure is fantastic, you have Theo a psychotherapist who is absolutely convinced he will be the one to gain Alicia's trust and get her to speak and then Alicia's POV is revealed through her journal entries before her husband's death. Reading someone's innermost secrets via their diary is always so interesting, it provides such an intimate glimpse into their psyche, and her whole persona fascinated me. Theo himself was also interesting, his personal history and how that played into his career was completely captivating.I'm not going to go on and on about the big twist because sometimes I think that ruins a reading experience, so don't even worry about that. Don't try and figure it out or guess when reveals are coming, just sit back and enjoy the ride because it's a wild one! The Silent Patient in three words: Clever, Captivating and Cunning. "

I really enjoyed it and once I really got past the first 50 pages or so I was determined to find out what was going on. Most of the narration was done by Theo, whom wanted desperately to help Alicia, the Silent Patient. He even applied and then transferred to her unit, one rumored to be shut down soon. He just knows he can help. Alicia narrates some in her diary entries and we have interaction between people. Pieces start fitting together fast and I started to see it and got a chill up my spine. I thought it was a very intense and good read. Worth it."
169,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57632045-mackenzie---phdiva-books,Rating 5 out of 5,"Darkly compelling and with a twist that will shock you! This is a top contender for best psychological thriller in my book—I absolutely am blown away that The Silent Patient is a debut novel for Alex Michaelides. When an act of unspeakable violence leads the main culprit to fall completely silent, everyone assumes that it’s an act. But years later, she still hasn’t spoken a word. With skilled writing and narrative structure and a standout twist, this is sure to be a must-read for 2019. Outstanding!!! A book I want to read again, even knowing the twists!ReflectionA silent siren, that is how chief psychologist Diomedesrefers to Alicia Berenson. A woman who was once so vibrant, she could bring energy to any situation now sits completely mute and subdued. But in a way, this contrast makes her even more attractive. Theo thinks he can help Alicia, just as many psychologists before him have tried. But Theo is sure he can be the one. Theo himself comes from damage. He knows what it is like, and he knows how the right person can bring someone back to life. Alicia was certainly the silent siren to me as the reader as well! I loved the way Michaelides described the feelings Alicia was able to convey through her eyes, even while silent and motionless. There’s still a person in there with fire inside, but outwardly she has turned to stone.Steeped in a fascinating Greek tragedy that I hadn’t previously heard of, this story is dark and addictive. I could scarcely put the book down! I loved the particular tragedy that was used as the catalyst and sort of allegory for the broader story. I won’t even tell you which Greek tragedy though, because I don’t want it to spoil anything! You’ll have to read to find out. But suffice it to say, it gave me a lot to think about as I read. It’s perfect, the way it melds with the story! Theo is like this child that was left forgotten at after school pickup. He’s so sweet and caring, but also sort of brushed aside. He is incredibly damaged and not without flaws. But he is also so grateful for the kindness of others. You sort of just want to give him a hug! But don’t let any of that fool you into thinking he doesn’t know how to help Alicia. He might be just the person that can get through to her!I was really captivated by the setting around therapy. Throw in a good discussion of countertransference any day and I’m a happy PhDiva (in psychology, no less!). The setting and the primary characters being artists and psychologists really added a rich context to the story. The introspection was spot on. Both professions are ones where the search for meaning in the ambiguous are prominent. I’d imagine most readers will be complete fascinated by the discussions of what is meant and what is being conveyed by the characters and the artwork.I don’t want to say much more, because I don’t want to spoil this book. But I highly encourage any psychological thriller fan to add this to their list! I received a copy from the publisher, but then purchased a copy as well, because I wanted to have a hardcover. That is how much I loved it!"
170,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16907451-erin-clemence,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book has 
 EVERYTHING 
 that I look for in a great read. It has a huge psychological component, which grabbed me right from the start, along with an actually unpredictable ending, fueled by suspense and page-turning drama throughout.  Alicia Berenson has not spoken a word since she was charged with killing her husband and admitted to a psychiatric facility. Psychotherapist Theo Farber is fascinated by Alicia and immediately jumps at the chance to serve as her doctor. As Theo’s persistence increases, Alicia’s will to remain silent only grows. Can Theo encourage the troubled woman to talk? Does he want to hear what she has to say? “The Silent Patient” by Alex Michaelides is by far one of the best debut novels I’ve read this year. The subject matter has been done ad nauseum  (spouse is found dead, other spouse is blamed….)  but Michaelides takes an overdone premise and reinvents it with creativity and powerfully addicting suspense. As I read the novel, the relationship between Theo and Alicia was suspect for me, as it violated almost every psychotherapy rule in the book, and I questioned the believability of this plot point. However, the ending provided me with the satisfying answers I was looking for, and my faith in Michaelides writing was reinforced. Creative, psychologically twisted and one hell of a suspense-fueled ride, “The Silent Patient” deserves all of the hype it gets. The only problem will be if Michaelides has set the bar too high for his future novels, and they will be able to hold a candle in comparison. "

I don't owe them (or the author) a review, but as this might actually be nominated for a Goodreads Choice award, I wanted to get my negative opinion out there now.Just...no. You'd have to have been living under a rock since Gone Girl (which I disliked with vigor because of its ending) came out to be surprised by the Big Twist. Add in a pervy, icky obsessional-male-gaze vibe...well...not for me. I'm not a woman-good-man-bad cultist, but I think I might be heading that way when a man authors this unironic celebration of the things that drive women to feel that way.It's clear that the author has writing chops, since I finished the book; in fact, I was clearly involved by it since I feel compelled to opine upon it and its award-worthiness. But each of the characters is nasty, and no I don't mean ""I don't like them"" nasty, I mean ""...and how do you plead to the charges?"" nasty. They're all, to a creature, embodying values and attitudes I dislike. I can't say exactly how without major spoilers. That's not fair to future readers, and don't ask for clarification because spoiler tags are easily ignored. Anyway. If this gets on the ballot for this award that increases and increases in visibility and importance, it will not be for lack of my shouting ""don't vote for it! it's squicky!"" at y'all."

Not even to plea guilty at her trial.Theo is a criminal forensic psychotherapist and he is fascinated with Alicia.He makes it his mission to get her to talk.But it might be easier said than done, as she is in an institution aka 'The Grove and heavily drugged up.But that's ok, as Theo has come up with a plan.

Alicia Berenson: The Grove's most infamous patient. Six years ago she tied her husband to a chair, shot him five times in the face, and hasn't uttered a word since. Theo Faber: The Grove's newest forensic psychotherapist. Highly regarded in his field, he has long been fascinated with Alicia's case, and believes he is uniquely qualified to help her.With such a killer concept I knew going in that it was going to be amazing, and The Silent Patient did not let me down. It was unsettling and alarming, with escalating tension, delicious curveballs, and a blindsiding, exhilarating ending, that had me shaking my head in stunned disbelief. Add in hypnotic prose, a spooky gothic setting, messed up psychological games, creepy artwork, and Greek mythology, and you have a winning formula. I barely blinked while reading. What a rush!The Silent Patient utilises first-person singular POV (Theo) with Alicia's diary entries interspersed throughout. Theo's views on nature vs, nurture, and babies emotional intelligence, were particularly interesting, even though I did not agree with them. I think I better leave it at that – short and sweet – as every time I try to include another sentence it crosses the line into spoiler territory.I'm begging all psychological thriller fans, who haven't yet had the pleasure, to read this now!

Well, this didn’t totally blow my bits off and it isn't necessarily reinventing the wheel, but for a debut novel, it’s pretty fun and not awful. Alicia, an artist, killed her photographer husband. And she’s been silent every day since. Locked up in a psych hospital, she hasn’t uttered a word in nearly seven years. Theo Faber is the overconfident psychotherapist who believes he's the one who can fix her.There were times, following Theo around as he frets about his hot wife’s shitty affair, that I was a bit bored. I wanted to be in the psych ward with the silent killer. That’s a weird statement to make, but it works in context. What I didn’t want was to be lurking in the park as someone’s dumbass wife gets nailed in the bushes. No pun intended.While the whole thing in the end with the twist and blah blah blah was pretty fun, the bulk of getting to that was a mixed bag. Theo's personal issues were just not as interesting as Alicia, even though he was creepy. Like he probably creases his jeans and eats oatmeal on purpose. It all pays off in the end, but it was executed oddly. The plot, for the most part, is layered and gripping. I wouldn’t call this a “thriller” so much as it is suspense and flat-out trickery. But suspense and trickery done pretty well.Recommended!⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 4 stars"
179,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93439193-kayla,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow! This book was amazing! In my opinion it is definitely worth all the hype that it's getting.I don't really know what to say about it because I don't want to give any of it away as it's just so good! In the most vague way I will say this:This story is about Alicia Berenson, a very successful painter and her loving, high demand fashion photographer husband, Gabriel. They seem to have the perfect life, till one night Gabriel came home late and Alicia shoots him 5 times in the face and doesn't speak again. She's now in the Grove, a high security psychiatric unit that has just hired a new psychotherapist named Theo Faber. All Theo want's to do is help Alicia and figure out what happened that night she murdered her husband and why he hasn't spoken since.This book is fast and quick to the point and kept me on the edge of my seat through the whole thing. I was so intrigued and interested I couldn't put it down, and when I had to, all I thought about was when I could pick it up again. It was such an incredible story with so many twist and turns."

My review contains mentions of abuse.Honestly this is one of the books from Booktok that I personally do not understand the hype for. I guessed the ending at the beginning and the supposed twist, which is very unusual for me to be able to figure out the mystery in mysteries/thrillers. Also I hated with a passion when Alex Michaelides said 'it is impossible for people who have not been abused before to become abusers'. I think that is downright awful. I will not be reading another book from this author and idk why it is hyped up with that very offensive comment in the book."

184,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33018840-mandy-white-mandylovestoread,Rating 5 out of 5,Oh my goodness what an amazing book! It absolutely lived up to the hype that is going around about it. I always worry when a book is so talked about that it will be a let down but in this occasion it is well deserved. Definitely one of the best books that I have read this year and it is going to be massive once it is released... On my birthday here in Australia on February 12th. The fact that the film rights have already been sold for it tells you everything really. It is a very clever book and written in a way that keeps you guessing right til the very end. The story grows up many likely candidates for the guilty party but you never really know until the last few pages. I was completely sucked into i early on and the opening few chapters are just brilliant. You need to get your hands on this book.The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides tells the story of a woman and her therapist. Alicia Berenson is an artist and married to Gabriel. She has had a tough life but she is finally happy. So why does she shoot her husband 5 times on his return home from work one night? And why has she not uttered a word since?Theo is a psychotherapist who believes that he can help Alicia. He changes jobs and moves to the same institution wher Alicia is being treated and soon stars to treat her. He becomes obsessed with the crime and does everything that he can to find out more about his patient and discover why she would kill her husband.Thank you to Hachette Australia and NetGalley for my advanced copy of this book to.

Happy reading!To join the discussion: https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/...Review originally published September 20214.5 stars/5 starsWow! Having read The Silent Patient (2019), I can see why it was among 2019's Goodreads Choice winners.I don't usually pick up a mystery/thriller at the library, as my cup of tea is a fantasy or science fiction story. One of my coworkers had read The Silent Patient and recommended it to me, so I decided to give it a shot. (This one also happens to be our Goodreads book club selection for October, the spookiest month of the year.)Turns out my coworker didn't steer me wrong!Few books have sucked me in right away, but The Silent Patient really hooked me from the outset. Alicia Berenson, from any outsider's perspective, has a pretty posh life. She's an artist of fame and renown, married to an equally in-demand fashion photographer (Gabriel). One night, Gabriel arrives home late from work and Alicia shoots him five times in the face, then goes mute afterwards, refusing to speak.After her murder trial, Alicia is sent to a secure psychiatric treatment center known as the Grove.Enter Dr. Theo Faber, a criminal psychotherapist, who takes a job at the Grove, determined to get ""the silent patient"" to talk and reveal why she killed her husband. He reveals that he's had a rough childhood and that he got a bit messed up, but generally seems genuinely interested in helping Alicia heal. After all, they are almost kindred spirits; Alicia too had a rough, abusive childhood that left deep psychological scars. Slowly, but surely, they establish a kind of trust after a heavily drugged Alicia attacked him the first time they met. (Rough start. Oof.)A picture slowly is pieced together throughout the book about Alicia's life, her primary testimony given in the form of a diary she entrusts to Theo. Before the murder of Gabriel, she reports seeing a mysterious man staring in the window, appearing to be watching the house, watching her. It had happened a few times previously, but those close to her thought she was crazy and just hallucinating, and got her to go see a doctor and get help.The author skillfully misdirects the reader. Every time I thought I had figured out the identity of the mysterious man creeping around Alicia's house, more evidence came to light. It got to the point where I didn't know what to think. Every character seemed to be psychologically messed up in some way and capable of murder. When the twist was revealed--no spoilers--I kicked myself for not having seen it sooner!The Silent Patient is a smart psychological thriller--bonus points in my book for Greek mythology references sprinkled throughout the story--that I would highly recommend to anyone looking to shake-up their reading routines.-CoraSee also:The Maidens (2021) by Alex Michaelides (His latest book.

The Silent Patient
 is one of those heavily hyped books that fails to deliver. Again. And I am not shocked. ** Spoilers ahead ** First, I am kind of shocked the author has a MA in English Literature from Cambridge. I mean, that's a prestigious school.So, why is the writing so bad?I mean, its really bad. Like infantile. Repetitive. Boring.For example, how many times does Theo reply to a question or observation with ""I see.""About eight, I think. I stopped counting after 3.Second, the screwed up timeline meant to purposely confuse the reader. This is not Tarantino-esque.This is not a TWIST. It’s a TRICK. And a mean one.Third, the point of a mystery is that the reader, along with the hero or heroine, read along to piece the mystery. Find the clues, the breadcrumbs, and work his or her way to solving the puzzle.You can't do that here. Because the author intends to deceive you right from the start. It's a fake out.Fourth, ohmygawd! the cliches abound here!, namely the most popular one; calling the heroine crazy. The doctors peg Alicia as delusional and a fantasist because she believes someone is stalking her.Why the automatic belief that she is making stuff up? Because she suffered a nervous breakdown when her father died?There is no plausible explanation why medical professionals would not believe a woman. Oh, right, because she killed a man in cold blood so she can't have been stalked by someone. Naturally.Fifth, Theo acting like he's one of the Hardy boys as he delves into Alicia's background to figure out why she's gone silent after murdering her husband.Clearly, that's why he's been hired at this clinic. To play detective, not to help other patients, of which there are no details or scenes of him doing so.Six, lack of character development. Who is Alicia, really? Why did she marry Gabriel?Oh, we get the explanation of why Theo became a psychotherapist, to endear the readers to him, but he comes off as a pansy. At least, to me he does.Maybe that's the point; he sounds and acts weak because of his damaged childhood but I didn't buy it. Seven, I didn't like him, sympathize or empathize with him, nor could I say the same about the whole sorry cast of characters, including Alicia.I might have given this two stars if not for the deceit implicit in the confusing timelines but the writing...oh man, it was sooo badddd not even James Bond could save this wreckage of poor prose."
187,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11267295-sharon,Rating 4 out of 5,"Alicia seemed to have the perfect life from working as a famous painter and living in a magnificent home to being married to fashion photographer, so why then did she end up shooting him five time in the face? And so the story begins as to whether, Alicia was guilty of killing her husband or was it someone else. As the investigation begins those involved in the case are getting nowhere fast due to Alicia’s silence. Since her husband was killed, Alicia hasn’t spoken a single word to anyone. Is her silence due to trauma after the shooting or is she protecting someone? I have recently read many great reviews for this book, so I wanted to get a copy to see if it was as good people were saying. And my answer surprisingly is yes and no. I must admit it started off with a bang in fact five of them and straight away you are hooked which is what you want in a thriller. But after that I found it slow going and not a lot happened until about the last twenty pages. Then once again it turned into a page turner with twists and turns to the very last page. I really would’ve liked a bit more to be going on in between, but in saying that I still thoroughly enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good thriller. "

I’m going to take the easy way out. A star for everything I liked about it. 🌟 Very well-written (looking forward to this freshman writer’s next book)🌟 Engrossing story line (who doesn’t love plot lines that include secrets, silent characters and mysterious mental institutions) 🌟 Brilliant twist (kudos— I didn’t guess it!)But I really don’t like the “unreliable narrator” genre and this book added to my annoyance with that type of storyline.

Obviously he does and immediately sent me a copy of this book which I started reading and devoured in a day.It’s taken me almost a week to write this review because I genuinely don’t know how to put my thoughts down and give this book the justice it deserves so I shall start with the basics. It’s a psychological thriller, so you know to expect a twist or two along the way and therefore I’m not even going to mention twists.The story is about a famous painter, Alicia Berenson who kills her husband Gabriel, a famous photographer by shooting him point blank 5 times in the face when he comes home late from work (yes I know, we’ve all been there) and then she basically stops talking. Staying absolutely shtum, not uttering a word Alicia is sent to a secure unit in my childhood home town Edgware where she remains THE SILENT PATIENT for years.Then we meet Theo Faber, a young criminal psychotherapist who is obsessed with this case and feels he can help Alicia talk about her crime and why she did it. So, when an opening at the secure unit comes up he grabs it with both hands and starts his journey to uncover the truth and be the “hero” who can get through to Alicia and get her talking.The story unfolds through Theo’s point of view and then through Alicia’s journal which she was keeping up until her husband’s murder. A fascinating and totally addictive story which kept me turning those pages (actually I was swiping my kindle but it sounds better the other way) faster than a contestant on Who Wants to be A Millionaire Fastest Finger First.I’m not going to divulge anything more, except there comes a point in this story when I had to STOP reading, take a huge breath and tip my hat to the author and think “Holy Motherf*cker, I did NOT see that coming”, and from that point onwards I read the book with a wry smile on my face, shaking my head in admiration and respect to Alex Michaelides for creating a story which I believe will be HUGE when it is published next February 2019.Just in case you weren’t sure – YES I LOVED IT. 5 HUGE STARS from me and totally recommend it to everyone who loves dark, psychological thrillers."
190,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60964126-ceecee,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow. This is one heck of a book which I could hardly bear to put down! The silent patient is Alicia Berenson, a talented painter, who was discovered with a gun in her hand and her husband Gabriel tied in a chair and shot several times in the head. She hadn’t spoken since then and was confined in The Grove, a secure mental hospital, run by Dr Diomedes. Everyone assumed she had killed Gabriel but as she had never spoken about it, how can we be totally sure? Psychotherapist Theo Roper gained employment there with the express intention of trying to get Alicia to talk. The story went backwards and forwards from events in The Grove to Alicia’s diary which told of events up to the murder of Gabriel. Her diary was very enlightening as it appeared she was surrounded by people who were a threat in some way or who she disliked. What we learned especially about her childhood was shocking and helped in some way to explain the events that led to Gabriel’s death and things that occurred in the Grove. I went through a range of emotions about both Alicia and Theo. Initially my feelings were sympathy for him but that changed as the story unfolded. I loved that Alicia told a lot of her truth through her art as well as with the written word. The ending was a doozy - I didn’t see that one coming! An outstanding book."
191,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11701608-barbara,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 Stars: “The Silent Patient” by Alex Michaelides is a creepy read, easily read in a couple of sittings. The narrator, criminal psychotherapist Theo Faber, is an unsettling narrator. He becomes obsessed with a woman who is in a secure psychiatric unit. It appeared that she shot her husband point blank, and never uttered a word afterward. She was mandated to the psychiatric unit instead of jail.Theo finds her story intriguing and wants to be her therapist. He believes he can help her. Meanwhile, Theo is having his own domestic issues. He is sure his wife is cheating on him. Theo’s obsession with the silent patient along with his preoccupation with his own wife’s work schedule and life makes for a creepy read. In fact, all characters in this novel are creepy. The reader becomes involved in finding out what really happened on the night of the murder and if Theo’s wife is cheating on him.This isn’t realistic fiction, in that Theo is a bit too preoccupied with a patient. He plays detective to an unbelievable extent. Yet, if you allow that to slide and go along with the ride, it’s an entertaining read. "

When Alicia is accused of murdering Gabriel by shooting him in the head five times, She goes silent and is willing to share her side of the story at all. She is soon placed as a patient at The Grove, A psychiatric treatment facility.Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist. He seeks out Alicia (creepy!) To “help“ her. He wants to be the person that Alicia finally talks to and shares her story with. But he’s got his own problems. He was in treatment as a teenager and that’s actually what motivated him to become a doctor. He tries hard and lands a job at “the grove“ where Alicia is a patient. Will he be able to get her to talk about what happened?This book has a loose plot, one dimensional characters, is long and drawn out, and is more about the doctor than the actual patient.

Big buildup, predictable ending, no payoff, gaslighting personified, weird descriptions of women... Just really was not a fan. I could see where the book was going and was not nearly as surprised by the twist as I wanted to be. I'm all for grey morality, but this just wasn't done well for me. I also hated the way women were described. They were either ugly, annoying, and overweight, or incredibly seductive, elusive, and viewed through the male gaze.

It could have been terrific, but that ending was SUPER weak to me.I had guessed much of the result, but there was still something unexpected about it. I think the timeline was well maintained. It would be nice to have a book where not EVERY SINGLE PERSON in the book was messed up and a liar. I think Ruth was the only mostly redeemable character, although I find it unlikely that she wouldn't have tried to reach out after that encounter. Indira was too blinded by her kindness to be of much help to anyone. Favorite part to think about: Paintbrush disappearing act.Favorite quote: ""Love that doesn't include honesty does not deserve to be called love.""Overall: I am left at a 3 stars. There were interesting elements and thoughts on psychotherapy and empathy, but by the end, I was rapidly losing interest in anyone or anything going on.

199,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3815302-libby,Rating 4 out of 5,"In an interview with Alex Michaelides at the end of my audiobook, he discloses his inspiration for ‘The Silent Patient.’ Growing up in Cyprus, where the Greek plays had a huge influence, Michaelides became captivated by Alcestis, who agrees to die in her husband’s place. In this tragedy that was written by Euripides, Heracles battles death for Alcestis and returns her to Admetus, her husband. She is unable to speak for three days. The importance of Alcestis to the novel will only become clear at its end, so don’t worry about trying to understand it. In the novel, Alicia Berenson’s husband, Gabriel, has been found tied to a chair and shot to death. Alicia is the only one in the house and her fingerprints are all over the gun. After she is arrested for the murder, she stops talking and paints a portrait of herself as Alcestis. The reader becomes better acquainted with Alicia through entries she makes in her diary; everything points to a marvelous love shared between Alicia and Gabriel. Both live in the art world, Alicia as a painter and Gabriel as a photographer. Enter the psychotherapist, Theo Faber, determined to help Alicia, to succeed in getting her to talk where others have failed. He takes a job at the Grove, a psychiatric institute in London, specifically for the purpose of hopefully getting to treat Alicia as his patient. Theo had a troubled childhood himself and was in therapy for years. When he finds Alicia in a dull stupor, he does what he can to get her medication dosage reduced, so that she can become lucid enough to talk, something she hasn’t done since the murder. The fact that she’s unpredictable and volatile doesn’t seem to bother Theo.The setting at the psychiatric facility is credible. I did a couple of rotations on a psychiatric ward when I was in nursing school, in a very old building; the sound of heavy doors locking behind you is formidable at first. The patients are intimidating as well, early on, when you're trying to figure everything out. I became interested in therapeutic communication and I'll never forget reflective communication or 'mirroring.' Your patient says, ""I feel terrible today."" Reflectively, you say, ""you're not feeling well today"" or ""can you tell me a little about that?"" What intrigued me was how impressively well that little technique worked. I remember my first day of clinical, my assigned patient met me angry because ‘the students’ were late, and he had been held up ‘waiting’ to go to the commissary. Talk about unnerving. In ‘The Silent Patient’ the relationships between the therapists, their supervisors, the psychiatrists, and other staff are rife with tensions that to me seem to come with the territory. Safety issues are always a major concern; in this story, the head nurse seems to be a bit of a tyrant because she is a stickler for safety rules. I can assure you, someone has to be, but I’m just as certain that authoritarian approaches may sometimes have to be made a little more flexible for some patients to get the help they need. The author worked in a locked down facility with teenage psychiatric patients, so I’m sure that’s where he racked up this level of credibility. I love the psychological intricacies, especially between Theo and Alicia, and what was circulating in their heads.Jack Hawkins as the voice of Theo and Louise Brealey as Alicia’s voice are both fabulous. Excellent pacing by both the author in his writing and narrators in their reading. In his interview, Michaelides, says he tried to accomplish a slowly building suspense, and I think he achieves that. There is a major surprising twist in the plot, but it does not feel gimmicky. It serves the story, and I wished I had guessed it, but I didn’t. A stellar reading experience that has already been optioned for film."

She has shot her husband, then has gone silent and has been placed at the Grove, a secured inpatient psychiatric center. Theo is trying to track down why she shot her husband when it seems they had a great life. Alicia is a painter, her husband Gabriel is a fashion photographer.

The ending had me like WOAH!! The story was so unique and I found myself flipping backwards in the book to piece things together. That’s when you know it’s a good one!!- This book read more like a mystery than a thriller to me, but the pacing of this was so good. Once I got about halfway through, I needed to finish it so I finished the rest in one sitting. I finished the entire book in less than 24 hours because every chapter ended with me needing to know what was next!- I never felt like I had any idea how this story would go and I loved every minute of it! The ending felt a bit rushed, but would be perfect to discuss at a book club. Definitely worth the read!! "

Enjoyed it so much I kept going back and re-listening to any (and all) parts I missed. Be prepared to ride a wickedly intense tidal wave of non-stop head-games, mysterious intrigue, and the epoch ending which is a shocker that almost knocked me out of my seat. - Not a good thing, either - I was driving at the time.... Looking forward to finding out what Mr. Michaelides has in store for us next."

205,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6351259-michelle,Rating 4 out of 5,"4 stars from a psych thriller skeptic!Alicia Berensen is the ultimate mystery. She was found in a very compromising position with her husband right next to her - dead of 5 gunshot wounds to the face. Everything seems pretty open and shut especially because Alicia will not speak. What ensues is a media firestorm around this case, but eventually attention dies down as the years go on and Alicia continues to say nothing. No one can get her to speak. Everyone has for the most part given up. Enter Theo Faber. Theo is a psychotherapist and it is his mission to crack this case. We follow Theo as he attempts to find out the truth.Everyone who reads my reviews knows that I am very hesitant to pick up psych thrillers. It seems everything in this genre is the next huge thing, but the amount of crazy plot twists (no matter how ridiculous) have really turned me off from this genre. While this wasn't my favorite story, I absolutely applaud the author for his debut effort. I found the ending believable (and holy crap I even guessed it - this NEVER HAPPENS PEOPLE), but most important is that it made sense to me. I could see how the author laid the trap, but it wasn't something so far out of left field that it made no sense. Theo Faber creeped me out and I wish a little more of the story was spent on Alicia and how she wouldn't speak. I thought this part of the plot was so unique and it really interested me, but I even though I wish more time was spent on the why, I agree with the author's execution. A very well done effort, which for lovers of this genre I highly recommend! "

207,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19559507-carolyn,Rating 5 out of 5,"Alicia Berenson, a celebrated artist, has been committed to a secure psychiatric unit, the Grove, since she was convicted of murdering her husband Gabriel, a man she loved deeply. Refusing to speak since she was found, spattered with his blood, in the room with his body and the gun that killed him, she has never explained the murder or said anything in her defence. Theo Faber, a psychotherapist recently employed at the Grove is very keen to work with Alicia to see if he can break through her silence after her years of silence.I listened to the audiobook narrated by Jack Hawkins and Louise Brealy. Jack Hawkins does a terrific job as the voice of the narrator Theo and I felt he added authenticity and richness to the characters of Theo and other staff at the Grove. Louise Brealy also does a fine job as the voice of Alicia narrating the diary she kept prior to Gabriel's death.This is an excellent psychological thriller, nicely paced and full of suspense as we watch Theo try to piece together Alicia's story and get some response from her. Theo takes on the role of amateur detective, teasing out facts and information about Alicia prior to the murder while Alicia's journal entries keep us informed of her state of mind. I enjoyed the explanations of how psychotherapy works and the psychotherapist's important role in capturing the patient's feelings and then feeding them back to her. The final twist worked brilliantly and made for a shattering ending. Overall, a very assured and original debut novel 4.5★, rounded up to 5★ due to the quality of the audiobook narration."

I was supposed to finish it in 3 days but I did in 2 as I so wanted to know the ending. For a debut novel, Michaelides has done a fine job.I actually loved the plot of the story and every character seems to add something to it. After reading it at around 75%, I thought I had a pretty good idea of what will happen next but the damn plot twist at the end was too good.The book also gives a great idea of how some negligence and certain improper behavior and acts by parents can leave some permanent marks on children's mental health which they have to deal with rest of their lives. All children are like sponges, they want to love and be loved."
209,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67691792-la-loca-de-los-libros,Rating 5 out of 5,"¡Vamos con la última reseña del año!⬇⬇⬇¡¡La paciente silenciosa no la he leído, la he devorado!! A pesar de que la acción al principio no viene en grandes dosis, sino que poco a poco se nos va metiendo en la trama con esas pequeñas pinceladas de intriga, ha logrado atraparme por completo. Sin duda, un gran debut. Aunque literariamente hablando haya sido su estreno, ya tenía tablas por ser guionista de numerosas películas, hecho que ha propiciado que la productora de Brad Pitt haya comprado sus derechos cinematográficos. Tengo muchísima curiosidad por ver la película y ver como logran engañar al espectador como ha hecho la novela, lo veo complicado pero veremos a ver. La novela está estructurada en cinco partes, cada una encabezada por frases del psicoanalista Sigmund Freud y la psicóloga Alice Miller entre otros, muy acertados para la historia que nos ocupa. Y abren con pequeños extractos del diario de la protagonista de la novela, Alicia Berenson. Hacia la mitad de la novela también nos iremos encontrando con esos extractos que nos resultarán muy reveladores. Y harán de la novela más adictiva si cabe. Eso sumado a la estrategia de los capítulos cortos hace que pases las páginas casi sin darte cuenta. El resto está narrado en primera persona por el psicoterapeuta encargado del caso de Alicia, Theo Faber, que está obsesionado con el caso y tiene como meta hacer hablar a nuestra callada protagonista. Cueste lo que cueste. Que, como reza la sinopsis ha quedado sin capacidad de comunicarse tras supuestamente descerrajar cinco tiros en la cabeza de su marido, Gabriel. Tras este suceso y su mutismo, es internada en el centro psiquiátrico The Grove, en Londres, donde transcurre toda la acción. Ni siquiera en el juicio es capaz de defenderse, su única forma de comunicarse es a través del arte, y lo hace pintando un cuadro al que llama Alcestis, una alusión clara a la obra homónima de Eurípides. Este será el punto de partida desde el cual se irá  desentrañando el misterio. Muy poco a poco. Pero perfectamente narrado. Con una trama retorcida y ese aura de tragedia griega. Es simplemente sublime 😍 La ambientación ha sido otro plus, me encantan las novelas ambientadas en psiquiátricos así que sólo con eso me ganó por completo. Y qué decir del llamado plot twist del final, un giro completamente inesperado, que nos rompe los esquemas, que por otra parte si lo piensas bien es hasta previsible, pero estás tan metido en la trama intentando ver sospechosos hasta en los matorrales de la urbanización 😂 que no eres capaz de ver más allá. Al menos eso es lo que me ha pasado a mi. Me ha absorbido tanto que no he logrado verlo hasta casi el final. Me he llegado a sentir engañada por como logra confundirnos una y otra vez con la trama, haciendo que dudes de todos. A pesar de esos pequeños engaños y la sensación de no entender algunos comportamientos de los protagonistas, la trama es tan fluida que la obra merece toda nuestra atención para que no se nos escape nada. Y como en todo thriller, cuanto menos se sepa, mejor.Una lectura perfecta como broche de oro para cerrar el año. Totalmente recomendable. 💜 ""Como pronto verás, es una historia increíble. De eso no cabe duda. Que la creas o no es cosa tuya."" 💜  ¡¡Y tanto!!https://m.facebook.com/LaLocadelosLib..."

The catalyst to all that is to come takes the form of a woman being accused of shooting her husband in the face five times . . . . 

Mitchell says this is the perfect book to read for Valentine’s Day. The book says . . . . 
“As you will see, it’s an incredible story – of that there is no doubt.Whether you believe it or not is up to you.”
I say I wanted to comment about how “meh” I was feeling about the book in general and more particularly the progress I was making . . . . and then I looked and I was at 56% in what seemed like zero minutes. This one earns its stars for the pages apparently turning themselves. Yes, you have to suspend disbelief in order to have a good time, but if you are able to do so a good time you most certainly will have as therapist Theo gets his patient Alicia to speak again."
211,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62566585-embibliophile,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 starsI buddy read this book with my sister and I’d probably have enjoyed it more if I wasn’t too busy trying to guess the plot twist because she stupidly dared me to, and I can’t back out from a good challenge. I should’ve just let it go and let myself be shocked.Alecia shot her husband five times in the face and she has been silent ever since. Six years later, Theo Faber decides to try to get Alecia to talk and to solve the mystery of the murder.The idea of the book is crazy enough to make you want to read it. This was such a short thriller with unbelievable undeveloped characters and a crazy plot twist, which you’d probably guess if you’re looking for it. However, some things didn’t make sense and my realistic brain refused to believe. It was also kinda over dramatic.This was a solid debut, Unputdownable-mainly because I wanted to know if my theory was actually right- and a really decent thriller. I enjoyed reading it and I was unable to decide wether to round that half star up or down!"

Entertainment Weekly described it as ""a mix of Hitchcockian suspense, Agatha Christie plotting, and Greek tragedy.""
This is a perfect explanation of this book. Besides, no one could give a better compliment than comparing one's work to Hitchcock himself! The plot was extremely intriguing. Halfway through the book I saw the plot twist coming but this book was still extremely enjoyable. Besides this, the way the Greek tragedy is intricately woven in the plot itself gave a true insight as to how good a psychological thriller can truly be!The only problem I found in this book was that a psychotherapist could never ever let his feelings become so closely associated with the patients and blur the lines and it took me some time to get into the story.Still it was an extremely enjoyable ride. The book is fast paced and a total must read."

214,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68985512-tmr,Rating 5 out of 5,"“We're all crazy, I believe, just in different ways.” (Indeed we are, indeed we are).A lot of people didn't like this novel, some of them were my close goodreads friends, but regardless I stood out, once again, mind blown and unable to utter another single word with loving such a novel.This novel...this gosh darn novel..is even more twist-worthy than My Lovely Wife, with it's understanding of human psychology, love, and how you go against someone you once loved and have to prove yourself without coming across as the criminal, like in a case of Alicia's.But I guess both those novels are equal in their own way, both have unique cases and qualities to them that make them stand out..........................................Here we go.The cover - Simple, nothing extraordinary. A therapist's office, presumably, a patient's chair, and with confessions from both patient and therapist.""Only she knows what happened."" (The world)""Only I can make her speak."" (Theo)Gah, that should be enough sentences on that to get you started, if the artwork is not so convincing. Geez. 'Nough said.The plot itself - We are introduced to a woman called Alicia Berenson with her picture-perfect life, being married to an in-demand fashion photographer. One day she shoots that same husband five times in the face and goes completely silent. Intrigued yet? If not, let me continue then.But her silence is what gives her more time in the spotlight, more than the average 15 minutes in the spotlight a normal person receives. In turn, she's put in a psychiatric center, to be treated. Meanwhile we're introduced to our second main protagonist, Theo Faber, a brilliant criminal psychologist, who's been waiting and watching to uncover the truth behind Alicia's actions and is recalled as the last hope. But what if the truth was more than what he could handle? What if it consumed him to a point of no return? Now you should definitely be intrigued. A silent woman, a murder that's got no reasonable explanation, no given reason for the silence, and two lives that are intertwined by more than one single threaded rope. I was definitely intrigued, hence why it deserved the points.The characters - Alicia is a brilliant woman, even with her confuzzling silence, clever and never leaves you bored, giving you one hint, a treat one page a time. As for Theo, him with his own recollections of his life, his own thoughts about the case, and his interrogations with each suspect linked back to Alicia and her case, keep you guessing, keep you thinking, and turning pages every time. Definitely these characters are to not be underestimated and even sympathised with, perhaps. But you'll definitely love them, as time passes and so do the pages. Points are given here.The mystery itself- You don't revisit the crime scene over and over again, but flashbacks do occur, discussions do happen, and links are connected. The interrogations are not dragged out, every conversation with Alicia or any other suspect are relevant and link back to the case one way or another, every move Theo makes, is also connected and connecting the dots too. So basically, what I'm saying is that the writing is clear-cut, fast paced, and leaves you hanging with each chapter's ending. Guaranteed it's a mystery worth appreciating. There go the points.The end -Mm, the ending. Definitely my most favorite and yet shocking ending. I didn't even see the huge plot-twist coming with Alicia's work, her family, her therapy with Theo. Well done to the author. The lead up to the ending may have been misleading sometimes but the big finish leaves you wanting more for hours...such was the ending, deserving all the points in the end.An excellent psychological mystery written, one which will have you reading all hours of day and night, desperate for it's conclusion and how it all came to be.PS: There seems to be talk of a film happening soon for this novel, I hope they actually make it into a film, I'd love to watch it. After all, I'm a mystery fan first, romance fangirl later.Until the next read,TMR"
215,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39272121-marilyn-trying-to-catch-up,Rating 5 out of 5,"An Excellent Psychological ThrillerThe Silent Patient by Alex Mchaelides was an excellent psychological thriller. I had heard so much about this book prior to actually reading it that I was afraid it would fall short for me. Boy was I ever wrong. I was so glad that I had the opportunity to listen to The Silent Patient on audio CD read by Louise Brealey and Jack Hawkins. They really brought the story to life. Every time I thought I had something figured out another curve was thrown in. The ending really blew me away. Once I began listening to The Silent Patient I did not want to turn it off. Many nights, as I arrived home, I found myself stuck in my car wanting to listen to more and more. My neighbors must have thought I was a little crazy when they saw me sitting in my car for so long. It was that amazing!Alicia Berenson was a famous artist that lived in London with her husband, a fashion photographer, named Gabriel. She and Gabriel loved each other very much and had a wonderful marriage. Alicia was quite fragile at times and depended on Gabriel a great deal. He appeared to care and worry about Alicia very much. Everything in their lives was wonderful until one evening in the summer when Gabriel arrived home very late from work. That night Alicia shot Gabriel in the face five times with his own gun. From that point on, Alicia became the silent patient. She chose not to talk.After being accused of Gabriel's murder, Alicia found herself at The Grove, a private psychiatric facility in North London. Theo Faber, a criminal psychotherapist, applied for a position at the Grove. When he was hired, he immediately set his sights on working with Alicia. He tried to convince his superiors that he could get Alicia to break her silence and talk. Theo's sole reason for wanting to work at the Grove was so he could get involved in Alicia's case. By now, Alicia's fate and silence had created a lot of talk and popularity. Theo felt confident that he could get Alicia to start talking and find out what really happened that fateful night. Eventually Alicia does start to speak. She shared her journals with Theo which gave him insight to what probably happened that night. He became so absorbed in Alicia's case that it started to threaten his well-being and his life.Alex Michaelides was able to weave, through his writing, a suspenseful and thrilling story in The Silent Patient. This was his first novel and what a novel it was! I sincerely hope he continues to write more novels. His talent for keeping the reader engaged and on the edge of the seat was evident. The Silent Patient was a fabulous psychological thriller. I recommend it highly."

The Silent Patient was a very enjoyable book and a solid 4.5 stars. Alicia is a famous painter and seems to have it all-a beautiful house, wealth and a loving husband named Gabriel. That’s why everyone was utterly shocked when Alicia is accused of shooting and killing Gabriel. Why would she kill her loving husband? To make matters worse, Alicia refuses to speak in her defense and is ultimately sent to The Grove-a secure forensic unit. At The Grove, psychotherapist Theo Faber takes Alicia on as a patient, where his interest in her seems to border on obsession. Theo has a lot going on with his new position at The Grove but in his personal life as well. There are many twists and turns in this book and I certainly didn’t see that ending (and what an ending is was!). I would highly recommend it to fans of mystery/thriller books-you won’t be disappointed. Thank you to the publisher/Celadon Books for providing me a copy for review. "

“No one is born evil. As Winnicott put it, “A baby cannot hate the mother, without the mother first hating the baby.”
🌟 After the huge success that this book had, I had to add it to my TBR list, I like to read thrillers as a change from the typical fantasy and contemporaries that I usually read. This was a successful BR with Fares, Azrah and Khadidja!🌟 This book was a bit weird for me because if I am going to be critical as usual, It does not deserve 4 stars! There were many things that were not well done as I will explain now. However, as the famous writer Hamad once said: “This is a thrilling thriller!” Oh wait, that’s me, never mind…🌟 The writing is not bad, it can be a little cheesy as my friend Fares pointed out, like when he said that he did not need weed because he was high on love! Okay?! Also, the idea is not new at all, I am not an expert at thrillers and I already read this plot before by the one and only, Queen of mystery “Agatha Christie” except that she did it better. Fares and I also predicted the ending while reading this. But it felt like too much coincidences were happening and the author left too many loose ends (her cousin, The “Turkish” patient, the ending?!) that were probably not important and were just thrown there for the sake of confusing the reader and making it less predictable.🌟 The writing was really atmospheric and we even had to check if the author had to do anything with the field of psychology! The psychiatry ward felt real though to me as someone who has done a rotation there. Although I saw a review saying the system is not like that in the UK which is upsetting and I did not think of that but you can know that these things happen elsewhere in the world! The gang were lucky enough as I told them some extra stories that I encountered in that rotation.🌟 I also liked that it made us start a conversation and discuss some serious topics like mental illness and cheating and marriage. It was gripping and almost all of us finished it in one day only. The fast pacing and small chapters made that very possible too.🌟 Summary: This is probably the most successful BR of this year, 4 people read the book in 1 day, discussed many things and all gave it 4 stars! The book was not perfect and some mistakes that are expected from a debut could have been easily fixed. If you are looking for a gripping read then I can recommend this or you can read The Murder of Roger Ackroyd by Agatha Christie for a similar but better version!A BR with my favorite gang: Azrah, Khadidja and The Silent Patient (Okay Fares literally has a sore throat and can't talk so he is currently a silent patient!!!).you can get the book from here: Book Depository"

229,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35740838-miriam-smith-a-mother-s-musings,Rating 3 out of 5,"There has been a lot of publicity on social media about the ""The Silent Patient"" written by Alex Michaelides and I was very keen to read it, being a real sucker for an addictive psychological thriller.Although definitely very addictive and compelling, losing track of time twice whilst reading it, I felt slightly let down overall and realised once again I'd fallen for the overhype bandwagon. It's difficult to explain how I feel (as it would reveal spoilers) but suffice to say, although everything fell into place at the end, albeit with some unanswered questions, for me this story didn't merit the fantastic praise it's been attracting. It's an entertaining story written in an intriguing way with lots of psychology and psychotherapy research to back the plot up but it was only just average.I know most fiction books are far fetched, unrealistic and require a suspension of disbelief but I just found the whole scenario inconceivable with quite a few inconsistencies.If you're looking for a quick, addictive read I would recommend ""The Silent Patient"" and I would probably read more from this author again. 3 stars"

“There’s so much pain everywhere, and we just close our eyes to it. The truth is we’re all scared. We’re terrified of each other.”

The Silent Patient, by Alex Michaelides is a very popular book. It's considered one of the best thrillers with an amazing plot twist, and I had high expectations going into it. I found this book to be very average. It was not bad, it was not good, but somehow it managed to be entertaining, so I can totally understand why this is so hyped up.

“You know, one of the hardest things to admit is that we weren’t loved when we needed it most. It’s a terrible feeling, the pain of not being loved.”

Alicia Berenson shoots her husband in the face five times, then never speaks another word again. Theo, a psychotherapist, is interested in Alicia's story and wants to help her. He thinks he can get her to speak again and figure out why she killed her husband. Theo decides to discover the truth of what really happened.

“...we often mistake love for fireworks - for drama and dysfunction. But real love is very quiet, very still. It's boring, if seen from the perspective of high drama. Love is deep and calm - and constant.”



My thoughts:

➼The Silent Patient a very average read. ➼The plot was intriguing, but the first half of the book was slow. Things did pick up more in the second half of the book though, which was great.➼I personally really liked the premise, but felt the execution wasn't the best. ➼I personally liked the 'plot twist of this book. It wasn't something I expected. ➼The writing was ok. It kept me hooked, but it could have been a bit better. ➼The characters were fine. I didn't really have any strong feelings for anyone. ➼The audiobook narration was really good, I would recommend it. ➼Apart from that, I had a fun time reading The Silent Patient, but it didn't live up to the hype for me and was a bit underwhelming. 

“Sometimes it takes courage, you know, and a long time, to be honest.”

Sorry for the short and vague review. I'm trying to clear up my 'to be reviewed', which currently has 145+ books so I'll be writing short reviews like this for popular books/ books I gave 2-3 stars.BR with Elena, Mary, Ishika, Aazra and Ananya. 💕

235,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7407123-pat,Rating 4 out of 5,"So that's what all the fuss was about! At least I'm not out on a limb all on my own with this one. I did actually really enjoy it. The author did an excellent job hooking the reader in right at the beginning. No synopsis from me, there are plenty of reviews that cover that better than I could.It was one of the most addictive books I've read for a while. Naturally, and having the sneaky suspicious mind that I do, I thought things would not be as clear cut as at first they seemed. There had to be something fishy about Theo Faber - the psychotherapist who was so keen to ""fix"" the patient, Alicia Berenson. The fact that he made a potentially career-killing move to a facility threatened with closure and that he broke so many rules in his attempts to get through to Alicia put a great big question mark over him for me as a potentially unreliable narrator.I did like Alicia. I thought she was very well written, Theo - not so much. I was never sure where his allegiances lay. Well, we found that out at the rather shocking, but not totally unexpected, ending. One of our former Prime Ministers had a saying I like - ""in the race of life, always back self-interest. You can at least be sure its trying."" That kind of sums up Dr. Theo. Mind you, as the book progressed most of the characters were found to have some unsavoury qualities which muddied the waters. On of the doctors kept his previous treatments of Alicia very quiet, one of the nurses was dealing drugs from the locked cabinet, and one of Alicia's friends coveted her art more than her friendship and so on.All in all a great debut effort and I would happily pick up the next book by this author."

And it was. It really really was. I absolutely fell in love with the writing style. It's a very well executed mystery with loads of twists and turns at the end of each chapter.The lack of star is due to the fact that I kind of saw the ending coming by the mid of the book. Don't get me wrong, trust me it's not an obvious ending. It's just that I've seen a bit too many mystery movies with something similar. But it's great. I loved it."

This book has been hyped to the point that I heard about it as early as February 2018- a full year before its publication date. What a snooze-fest. Premise was idiotic, book was not suspenseful, and the ending was whack-a-doodle. Luckily I had this in an ARC. If I had paid for this pablum, I would have been super-ticked off. My recommendation: Hard Pass. "

Jaw dropped in the end , Michaelides did a great job with this book and by saying a great job I mean I had a different types of emotions . I couldn’t leave this book down I was addicted of it , most of the times when I was at work I was sure enough that she was innocent but sometimes I was in doubt just because of the psychosis & the trauma she had . I never read a book like this , in the end it feels like you are reading the book backwards to come to the finish. I had so many villains in my head. ( I suspected doctor Diomedes at some point). I never at any one point saw it ending the way it did. We need a movie of this .We need more books from Alex Michaelides . Can’t wait to read more of his books. I’m excited to recommend this book to everyone I know that is one of my favorites so far for 2019-2020I had to write to the author, guys you won’t believe it he was so open minded to writing back to his readers , because you know some of the authors they don’t even bother writing you back ! Just for this reason I love the book even more ! Biggest fan of Alex ❤️"
239,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30505436-shruti,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Silent Patient was the winner of the 2019 Goodreads Choice Awards which was the sole reason I was attracted to this book. I have to say that I have mixed feelings about this one—I'm switching back and forth between 3 and 4 stars. Alicia Berenson, a renowned artist, murdered her husband, Gabriel, six years ago. After she shot him in the face five times, she slit her own wrists. But she survived and when she awoke, she refused to speak. She was declared guilty of murder and since she wasn't in her right mind, she was sent to the Grove, a psychiatric facility where she has continued to remain silent. Theo Faber, a psychotherapist had followed the case all those years ago and when, six years later, a post opens up at the Grove, he seizes the opportunity and applies for the job. After joining the Grove, he is determined to get Alicia to talk so she can finally tell her story. Starting with the writing—it was truly gripping. Alex Michaelides has done a wonderful job. I enjoyed the way the chapters had been framed and I found it hard to put the book down. A majority of the chapters are from Theo's PoV and a few chapters detail the contents of Alicia Berenson's diary. It gives us an insight into the events of her life and the state of her mind in the weeks before the murder. Coming to the big twist, it was a great one, there's no doubt about it. But I'm the sort of person who constantly forms theories in her mind when she's reading a mystery/psychological thriller, and this book was no exception. I'd formed a few theories in my head and the twist was one of those. Having said that, I have to admit that when I read those words, I had to sit up straight and reread. Even though that theory was always in the back of my mind, the manner in which Michaelides just put the reveal across the page, all of a sudden, surprised me. It was a momentary reaction however because the thought that followed was of me berating myself for having formed the theory in the first place. If I hadn't, it would have been a five-star read, for sure!I really enjoyed reading this but I'm not sure about it being the Best Mystery/Thriller of 2019 for me. (Apart from The Whisper Man—which I enjoyed much more than this one—I haven't read the others. I'm trying to make my way down that list) I would still 100% recommend reading this book. I have a feeling that like the famous phrase it's not you, it's me, The Silent Patient is not completely at fault here. It's just that I've read a lot of psychological thrillers and I could see it coming. I hope you don't!"
240,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51664350-paul-weiss,Rating 4 out of 5,"One of only a handful of books in my life that I’ve plowed through in a single day!Alicia Berenson seems to have the tigers of the world by the tail. She’s a celebrated painter whose work is showcased in a grand gallery. She’s happily married to a well known fashion photographer and they’re living in a home that would be the envy of many in the city of London. But one evening when her husband returns home late from work, she shoots him five times in the face and, to all appearances, shuts herself down mentally. She never speaks another word. Perhaps she can’t or perhaps she won’t … who knows? Judged in court as mentally unfit, she is locked away indefinitely in a secure psychiatric institution. Enter criminal psychotherapist Theo Faber who takes up the challenge of searching for the truth, diagnosing and treating the issues behind Alicia’s continuing silence.THE SILENT PATIENT is definitely a page turner with a bizarre ending twist. Nevertheless, despite the fact that I was unable to set the book aside and finished it in a single sitting, I withheld one star from my rating. Even allowing Mr Michaelides literary license to create the mandatory twist to end a psychological thriller, I felt that my credibility meter got pushed just a little too far into the red zone. Who’s to say why people with psychological issues make the decisions that they do but I had more than a little difficulty puzzling through this particular bad guy’s motives. That said, THE SILENT PATIENT is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller that’s very easy to recommend to other lovers of the genre.Paul Weiss"

I read it in one sitting, the suspense had me hooked!Alicia seemingly loved her husband so dearly, then why did she shoot him point blank, 5 rounds to the face?This book follows Alicia and the events leading up to her husbands death. Since his death she is silent she will not speak a word, which made me want to know even more why she did it.....Enter Theo Faber, the new psychotherapist at ""The Grove"" the psychiatric unit where Alicia has been for 6 years since she killed her husband and still hasn't spoken a word to anyone. Theo is confident he can help her, to tell her story, to heal and get well.The suspense builds as we learn about the people in Alicia's life, the writing is superb, very clever. I'm not going to say much more as I don't want to spoil it..... but that ending. My reaction was..... Wait, WHAT? I had to re-read the page again, damn I did not see that coming! That ending took the book to a solid 4 stars for me. This is a fabulous debut novel and I look forward to reading more from this very talented writer."
242,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3268839-theresa-alan,Rating 4 out of 5,"I listened to this as an audio book, and the man who read from the point of view of the psychotherapist Theo and the woman who read the diary of accused murderer Alicia were both talented. This book had a lot of hype, and I think it doesn’t entirely deserve it. It was decent enough for the psychological mystery genre. Did the talented artist Alicia really shoot her husband? All evidence points to her, but why did she do it? She’s stopped talking, so no one can get any answers out of her. Theo tries from the institution she’s been ordered to, but he makes no progress. I did like the twist at the end. This is a good book, but I don’t think it was as great as I’d been led to believe. For more reviews, please visit http://www.theresaalan.net/blog"

244,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64085497-tori,Rating 4 out of 5,Well. This was a reminder for why this genre is my favorite! I was kind of in a reading slump but this book helped me out of it. I had a few different ideas of what the twist would be but I was wrong (as always). I never saw this one coming. At all.

246,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36820476-irene,Rating 1 out of 5,"LOL. This book was a hot mess. A hot boring mess. I'm genuinely baffled that it has so many 4 and 5 stars. I've certainly disagreed with the consensus of reviews before, but I'm not sure I've ever simply not understood how someone could give a book a high rating when so many did. An interesting premise, a woman killing her husband then never speaking again and the therapist who finally gets her to talk, turned into...nothing.Sure, the twist at the end was vaguely entertaining. But it doesn't excuse that the other 300 pages vacillated between being boring and infuriating all narrated by a truly unlikeable main character. Plus there's a fun sprinkling of misogyny (every women except the titular silent patient is either a bitch or a whore according to the book/the main character).So let's tackle some of those complaints. The main character, Theo. I get that he's not supposed to be entirely likable. But please give me something if I'm going to be in his head for most of the novel. Writing gray characters is possible and they can be fascinating. Theo was not. He was whiny and mediocre. A character who we were told was an excellent therapist without ever seeing it, who we were told was wildly in love with his wife without ever seeing it, etc etc. Which leads me to the depiction of mental illness and psychiatric treatment. Apparently, being a therapist makes you psychic. Theo could look at any person and read their mind, motivation, and history. His form of therapy was to feel the emotions of his patients himself and process them for them - something that we now literally teach therapists how NOT to do. No one has a diagnosis in this book, they are ""mad"" or ""borderline"". I wanted to shake the author and ask him what he thought the word ""borderline"" meant in a clinical setting, because he clearly wasn't referring to borderline personality disorder. Everything was caused by someone's parents and what happened in their childhood. At one point he claims that someone cannot become an ""abuser"" without having been abused themselves. WHAT? An adult says something cruel to a child and it is described as psychic infanticide. PSYCHIC INFANTICIDE. What on earth does that mean? Even something as factual as medication management he gets astonishingly wrong.Look, normally I'm on my high horse with mental illness in books because I think how media frames mental illness contributes to stigma and is important. But here, I don't even know that that's the case because it's all just laughably wrong. I knew going in that there was probably going to be some problematic mental health stuff and I really was ready to put it aside. You're not looking for realism in a thriller. But this was...so much. And about the actual thriller. What thriller? What suspense? A series of obvious, deeply cliched events certainly did not add up to a book that I couldn't put down. And in regards to the twist. I really think that a book shouldn't only be redeemed by how it ends. That's an idea, a ten sentence short story. Not a novel. "

Convicted of murdering her husband, she has been silent ever since. Theo finds himself in a new job at the facility where she is held and makes it his mission to have a breakthrough with her when no one else was able to.  “Choosing a lover is a lot like choosing a therapist. We need to ask ourselves, is this someone who will be honest with me, listen to criticism, admit making mistakes, and not promise the impossible?”  I read this because I saw a lot of my Goodreads friends loving it and describing it as hard to put down, and I completely agree. The first half of this book was 4 stars for me and then it kind of went downhill. I did completely devour this in a day, so that's saying something. I liked how compelling the story was.I didn't love the narrator, I found him boring at times and I skimmed a bit. The way it all came together in the end was a bit too far fetched for me as well. But since I read the entire book and enjoyed it for the most part, this book gets 3 stars.  “...we often mistake love for fireworks - for drama and dysfunction.

I kept seeing good reviews on this one here so I just had to give it ago and I wasn’t disappointed.The way this book is split into two characters and written in two different people’s perspective is brilliant! It really allows you into the minds of each. Alicia is such an amazing character and I feel for her throughout this book – her love for Gabriel is beautiful but is it too good to be true?As the book progresses you start to question everything and everyone – which I loveeee in a book! Is Alicia a crazy murderous psychopath or is there something more to this? Theo is in turmoil in his personal life but is determined to speak to Alicia and find out exactly what happened to the woman who had it all turned murderer but is his determination about to destroy him.

249,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50893023-johann-jobis89,Rating 3 out of 5,"“Her silence was like a mirror - reflecting yourself back at you. And it was often an ugly sight.”Alicia Berenson is in a psychiatric facility following the murder of her husband, but she refuses to utter a word. However a new psychotherapist, Theo, thinks he is the one to finally get her to speak.Talk about a twist I didn’t see coming! It’s been a while since a book made me audibly gasp! So I can confidently say that if you’re looking for a psychological thriller that provides twists and turns... this one is worth checking out.You can tell Michaelides has meticulously plotted out the story, there’s lot of little details that become very rewarding and perhaps also little hints as to what is going on. He builds the suspense very slowly, where you know something is wrong but you can’t put your finger on it, until it all comes together in an explosive finale. Very impressive!However, my issue with thrillers (the majority of them anyway) remains the same - once I finish one I’m left with a feeling of “well, that’s that!” and I just don’t really think about it again. They don’t satisfy me in the same way as a lot of the other genres I read. I won’t remember these character’s names... (in fact I had already forgotten, I needed to check the book for this review) and the details already feel quite hazy, to be honest. Whereas when I consider possibly the only thriller I’ve truly LOVED, Gone Girl, I remember so much!! It left an impact!But then again, not everyone is looking for a lasting impact - this is a great book to lose yourself in and be entertained for a few hours. So on that basis, I’d definitely recommend it! 3.5 stars."
250,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/81046856-sandra,Rating 4 out of 5,"An unusual thriller that had me gripped from the start. Alicia Berenson is an artist. Late one evening the police turn up at her London home and find her covered in blood and standing over her husband, Gabriel. He has been shot five times in the face. From that minute Alicia refuses to talk, or give any kind of explanation. Her silence turns the tragedy into a mystery that captures the public imagination. She is sentenced for the murder of her husband and held in a secure unit called the Grove.Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist........the first section of the book is from Theo’s perspective and we get to know him and his background. When he starts working at the Grove he jumps at the chance to help Alicia. He is determination to get her to talk and to find out why she shot her husband. I feel he goes beyond what a psychotherapist would normally do for a patient, but if you suspend your disbelief and just go with it, it all hangs together well. Great thriller and I loved the medical/psychology side of the narrative."

257,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64982458-matt,Rating 5 out of 5,"I took a break from the bestseller list for a while, but social distancing had me craving more books. I’m normally not a fan of the books with the BIG twist, but I thought I’d give this one a try because of all of the hype. The Silent Patient was a taught, detective style mystery/thriller novel that had a unique style that kept it fresh for the genre. This was Alex Michaelides’ debut novel, but after some research I found out that he has experience in screenwriting. It’s an experience that he described as “soul crushing” in an interview with thebookseller.com. He seems like a natural novel writer, which doesn’t surprise me because novel writers seem more likely to be less collaborative than screenwriters in my limited knowledge of screenwriting. There were two things that stood out to me about this book while I was reading. The first was Michaelides’ ability to use greek mythology in a poetic way. He uses art and mythology as a backdrop making the story unique and fresh. It turns out that when he was thirteen years old, he was enamored with the greek story of Aclestis and at the same time he was discovering the writing of Agatha Christie. He mixed the two together and bam, he struck gold, proving that creative ideas can come to us if we listen and develop them over time. I'm not going to summarize the story of Aclesits here because I don't want it to spoil the book for anyone, but if you wish to dive down the rabbit hole, there is a link at the end of this review. The second thing that stood out to me was the way that he blended psychology into the story. His writing was informed by his schooling as a psychotherapist. I’m no expert on psychology, but in my experiences with mental illness, he does a great job with the portrayal and how humans internalize the traumas that haunt us from our past. He goes on to say that he didn’t finish the degree because he knew he was a writer not a therapist. This shows an incredible amount of knowledge and self-reflection about himself. It’s not easy to give up on something that you’ve put time and energy into. It seems as though he’s made the right choice and will have a very successful career as a writer.

258,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/78330000-sarah,Rating 4 out of 5,"Wow. Holy shit. THAT twist was executed so brilliantly! The Silent Patient is a page-turner, psychological thriller, that you will not want to put down. The beginning is a little slow, but stick with it and you will soon be flying through trying to reach the end.Alicia Berenson is a woman trapped within the confines of her own mind after her husband’s murder. She is accused of shooting him five times, is found guilty, and now is housed within a psychiatric facility. She hasn’t spoken since the incident.Theo Faber is a psychiatrist with a troubled past himself. He is captivated by Alicia and her story and wants to talk with her to see if he can find a way to the truth of why she shot her husband. His search for this truth is peeled back slowly; the darkest secrets of this intriguing woman are slowly revealed. The reader is then rewarded by the gut- punching twist.Will Alicia talk again? What she will reveal?Early on, with Theo saying his abusive father probably had a personality disorder made me audibly groan. Then, shortly after another psychiatrist (Christian) assumes that Alicia is faking symptoms because of her borderline personality disorder (BPD) diagnosis. Theo counters this with ”how can she be faking if she has borderline”, which was a line I was thankful for.I have strong opinions against Cluster B disorders being further stigmatised and everyone that has them being automatically painted as abusive. Or used as a trope for murderous characters. So, I tread lightly when fiction veers off into that direction. I’m particularly sensitive to this because I have been diagnosed with BPD myself, it is such a difficult disorder to live with and manage the symptoms day-to-day. The way Christian speaks so flippantly about “borderlines” infuriated me at times. A solid 4 star read for me, but I can see why so many would rate it 5."

The pace was good and the overall length meant I read it in two days and almost two sittings. From the very start the narrator does not sound like a psychotherapist, I don’t find him credible at all. Maybe this is somewhat intentional...? I also found that there were a few Cliches used in the novel. Some of the approaches that Theo uses when treating Alicia seem pretty obvious and I wonder why it took 7 years and then Theo to try them first. The twist was clever and not as obvious as other thrillers, which I appreciated. However the I felt like the credibility of the story was compromised."

261,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1170391-sara,Rating 3 out of 5,"What a perfect, thought provoking, thriller. Alicia killed her husband in cold blood, then calmly went into her studio to paint her masterpiece, the Alcestis. Since that day she hasn’t spoken a word. Theo is a psychotherapist, one who’s convinced he can get Alicia to speak. Can he convince her that he’s there to help, and gain the answers everyone is desperate to hear? Why did Alicia kill her husband? Why won’t she speak? And why is Theo so enraptured with her?This has a mixture of narrative, with Theo’s perspective driving the story forward with his obsession to break though to Alicia. This is scattered throughout with segments of Alicia’s diary, which is full of paranoia and gives a truer sense of who Alicia is before the murder. Even then she comes across as alluring, not in a necessarily sexual way, but in a needy and desperate to be loved sort of way. She attracts the wrong sort of characters to her. Ones who seem to objectify Alicia. Post murder she’s equally alluring, and deeply seductive, as she knows the power she holds within. Yet she’s also unpredictable, and terrifying. Theo’s obsession is completely understandable, and his own troubled past and personality type is almost the ying to her yang. I found his narrative very soothing to read, almost as if his voice was talking directly to me in a calm and collected manner. I found this definitely helped me warm to him, and helped to highlight the differences and similarities between the two characters. The secondary characters are a mixed bag. Diomedes is interesting, if a little lacking in personality. The same for Indira. I also found Christian a little too contrived as the antithesis to Theo. But most of all, I really wanted to see more of Elif. Comparing the two, we can almost see how Alicia isn’t like the other patients. She’s holding a part of herself back, while showing the onlookers that she’s given up. Elif is who Alicia could have been if her personality was different. We only see little glimpses of their interaction, and more so the aftermath, and it would have been interesting to build on this. But honestly, I’m just being picky here. They’re all really just props to support and build on Alicia and Theo’s world. The plot unfolds gracefully. It’s almost as though we slowly unpeel Alicia’s secrets piece by piece, layer by layer, as we see Theo become increasingly caught up in her story. The pace also ramps up significantly near the end, with secrets and lies being exposed on every page. Each revelation felt real, and fully formed, carefully crafted into the storyline purposely to make the reader rethink everything they thought they knew about these characters. Well written, well developed and a great set of characters."

Misticismo que atrae a Theo, un psiquiatra que funciona como narrador y que está decidido a ayudarla.

La fórmula es más que efectiva.Además, y no como aspecto menor, eleva una crítica tácita al manejo interno de los centros psiquiátricos donde los pacientes quedan a merced de psiquiatras que muchas veces prefieren sedarlos que tratarlos o que establecen codependencias peligrosas con los sujetos a su cargo."

272,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32222897-sunny,Rating 5 out of 5,"Shocking. Addicting. Insane.This was unputdownable. I listened to the audiobook in one sitting. No pauses, no breaks. Just nine full hours of pure suspense.  Alex Michaelides debut novel is a promising start to his writing career. I was obsessed with the story from the very first word to the very last. When the seemingly perfect Alicia Berenson is found in her home after shooting her husband in the head, she is kept in a mental therapy center where she refuses to utter a single word. Her silence and refusal to explain the events of what occurred that night causes psychotherapist Theo Faber to take a keen interest in her. As their sessions progress, Theo finds himself unfolding new truths to her past that no one has ever been able to get out of her.If you pay attention to the story and actively try to piece together the scattered information, you should be able to figure it out. I'm typically good at my predictions, but my ability to be accurate completely escapes me when I am utterly enamored by the story. I was too busy waiting for the next sentence to figure out possible endings. I highly suggest listening to the audiobook. Many times, audiobook narrators could ruin the entire story of a book that could otherwise be perfect. But other times, the narrators do such a phenomenal job that it provides another level of emotion that isn't possible to feel when just reading out of the book. This is that book. The English accents make the characters more real in their setting. And Jack Hawkins narrates Theo's POVs stunningly.I will be on the lookout for  Alex Michaelides future works. He has a brilliant storytelling process that leave me wanting more."
273,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,Rating 3 out of 5,"I saw many favourable ratings & reviews for the book over the past several months. There were also some reviews which were critical which added to my curiosity. This book has been a mixed bag – I am certainly happy I read it, and yet my overall rating & feedback is not as favourable as most. Alicia Berenson, a successful artist, is in a psychiatric care facility after she was arrested for killing her husband - Gabriel . Since then, however, she has been silent and not spoken about what transpired and why. Theo Faber is a psychotherapist who finds her case fascinating, and applies to join ‘The Grove’, the facility where Alicia is. To understand her state of mind and possible reason for the crime, he speaks to several people involved with her, in an effort to find the best way to reach out to her. Theo has had a troubled past himself and hopes he is well placed to find a breakthrough in the therapy.The book has a big twist and while I sensed a little of the convergence which was coming, it still came across as very well broken & unexpected. The build-up is very gradual, but the book kept me fully engaged. I also liked the touch of mythology intertwined in the story. The issue though is that I like stories to be logical in entirety and tie up prior chapters satisfactorily when the revelation comes.  For starts, as a therapist, Theo’s behaviour is impractical & weird and more aligned for the later drama which is to come. The book leaves several Why’s insufficiently explained – Why the murder, Why the silence, Why the obsession…..Nevertheless, a read which went smoothly and kept me engrossed."
274,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/114049471-violeta,Rating 2 out of 5,"I had to laugh when the author claimed, during an interview at the end of the audiobook, that when he set out to write this book he wanted it to be a novel and not a film-in-waiting. Oh come on, that's exactly what this is: a screenplay aspiring to be ""not only a psychological thriller but a literary work."" His words again, not mine. A psychological thriller is not at all a bad idea - but a psychological thriller that takes itself too seriously, is. Mr Michaelides is cashing in on psychotherapy having become the thing to do lately and the fact that a broader audience has become acquainted with terms like transference, countertransference, trauma, psychodynamics, regression and what have you. Never mind that many of us don't fully grasp their meaning; they do sound nice and informed, so why not use them with devil- may-care abandon? The concept of investigating a crime not only in the traditional way of good old detective-work but in the more in-depth approach of psychoanalytical exploration is original and intriguing but, after a decidedly gripping start into the story, so many clichés and oversimplifications set in that depth and originality go out the window. Plus, I had the sense the author is just trying too much to complicate things with all the twists and turns he keeps throwing in the mix. Not bad for a beach-read or to listen-while-exercising but just not worth of all the hype surrounding it. Now...when is the movie due to come out??"

This is one of those books that I loved so much, I had such a hard time articulating all the things I loved about.  The Silent Patient  is a dark, gripping character study - a truly immersive story that draws readers into the mind of a therapist determined to treat a woman convicted of murdering her husband in cold blood.

277,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4467515-jasmine-from-how-useful-it-is,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book was an excellent read, as expected from the rave I kept hearing. A therapist unlike others, one who wasn't perfect and one who also saw a therapist himself. I liked following a therapist's job. Working at a mental hospital sounded taxing, especially where there were patients who murdered. The characters were not what they seemed. I thought they were nice or mean but they ended up with another unexpected side. I liked when stories focused on people with two faces because I'll never know what to expect and I liked getting the surprise at each turn. This book started with a prologue, following Alicia's diary. This diary with entries for different days will be inserted between the chapters in the story as readers slowly unravel the mystery behind the silent patient. Then the story began, following Theo the forensic psychotherapist, told in the first person point of view, informing readers that Gabriel was killed 6 years ago. The police found Gabriel tied up to a chair with gunshot wounds and Alicia, Artist, bleeding to death nearby with knife wounds. Alicia survived but was charged for Gabriel's murder; however, Alicia didn't speak up to defend herself. She stayed silent. Theo wanted to be Alicia's therapist and to eventually get her to talk. While Theo was a therapist for Alicia, he battled with his own demons. The Silent Patient was well written and a fast paced couldn't put down kind of read. I liked following a psychotherapist's view and how he analyzed people's responses. I liked the analysis on love. A child who was loved by his/her parents will in turn received love from him/her. Recently I read The Plot where the mom complained that her child hated her and it was because she thought about abortion and adoption during her pregnancy. I felt bad for Paul to be bossed around by his mom even at that age. This book definitely brought to light different people with different problems. In the end, I couldn't guess what happened and got the surprise of my life when it was revealed who ""the man"" was. I highly recommend everyone to read this book!xoxo, Jasmine at www.howusefulitis.wordpress.com for more details "

282,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30863291-philip,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5ish stars.Nothing outstanding or innovative as far as mystery thrillers go, but it's fast-paced and everything is written and plotted perfectly adequately. My only complaint is I think the central premise of the patient's silence is gimmicky and it didn't ring true to me even after the reason was revealed. Otherwise I liked it and I've read a lot worse in a genre that I generally enjoy. As with every mystery thriller there's a twist that it seems is either obvious from the beginning or a complete surprise varying from reader to reader. I'll concede that sometimes my enjoyment hinges on whether/how soon I can predict the twist before it's revealed. In this case my mind was going a completely different direction and I thought I was super clever, but I ended up being way off. I'll just say that I could have figured it out and it wasn't that tricky I swear. If nothing else, the twist I had in my mind was super good and I should probably become a mystery author.Posted in Mr. Philip's Library"

I‘ve been in the worst book slump of the year since like November so I picked books through prompts and now I‘m so glad I picked this one!Also I challenged myself to switch screen time for reading so my brain had no excuse to lose focus but I seriously didn‘t even need that.I was hooked from the beginning and it only got more twisted!It was so easy to read and so captivating I didn’t want to put it down. The author wrote this book just brilliantly, so amazingly confusing at times and I was trying to figure out who did what to whom and when and why but the twists never stopped and every time I thought I got it. I know what happened, another turn creeped up on me completely unexpected. I also loved the use of a greek play/tragedy that I at first didn’t pay much attention to until it was all woven together and everything kind of related back to it and it was mind blowing to me.The ending left me just completely speechless. Never would have expected it. Never saw it coming until it hit me in the face!"

The story was like a delicious unassuming alcoholic drink that ends up packing one hell of a punch!! I also enjoyed the mini interview with the author at the end of the audio. It was a great bonus."

287,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15493045-lisa,Rating 4 out of 5,"A dark and twisted psychological thriller of a woman’s violent act against her husband and the therapist obsessed with helping her to talk againSUMMARYAlicia Berenson is a famous painter, and has been married to Gabriel, a well-known fashion photographer for seven years. They live in a grand house overlooking a park in one of London’s most desirable areas. Alicia is feeling a little depressed, so Gabriel, encourages her to start keeping a diary. One evening, Gabriel returns home late from a fashion shoot and Alicia, shoots him five times in the face. She never speaks another word.With Alicia‘s refusal to talk, she was convicted and committed to The Grove, a secure forensic unit in North London. For six years, she refuses to talk to anyone, occasionally exhibiting acts of violence and is therefore kept heavily sedated. Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist, who seeks out the opportunity to work with Alicia. His thinks he can get her to talk and perhaps unravel the mystery of why she murdered her husband. His efforts takes him down the twisting path into his own motivations - a search for the truth that threatens to consume him. What is motivating his obsession with Alicia case? Can Theo really help her? Does he really want to hear what she has to say?“Once you name something, it stops you seeing the whole of it, or why it matters. You focus on the word, which is just the tiniest part, really the tip of an iceberg.”REVIEWIt’s a ghastly murder by a troubled woman. This haunting tale will have readers ripping through the pages to see if Alicia ever speaks again and why she would have killed the husband she loved. Theo, her therapist with issues of his own, goes above and beyond in investigating the secrets of her past. THE SILENT PATIENT is masterful at creating numerous rabbit holes that will have readers questioning everything they think they know about the story. The Silent Patient is part crime story, part character study. Alicia’s detailed diary entries are key to unlocking what’s in her mind and who she is. The further Theo digs into her history the more concerned he becomes. Uniquely, author Alex Michaelides finds some basis for this story in the tragic Greek myth of Alcestis. Michaelides writing is good and his character development was stellar. Author Alex Michaelides is a screenwriter and THE SILENT PATIENT is his first novel. I listened to audible version of the dark book and found listening to it as eerie as the book’s cover. An author interview at the end of the book was very enlightening as his motivations and thought process.“I’m forty-two years old. And I became a psychotherapist because I was fucked-up. That’s the truth - though it’s not what I said during the interview when the question was put to me.”Publisher 	Celadon Books Published 	February 5, 2019Narrated	Jack Hawkins, Louise Brealey Review	www.bluestockingreviews.com"
288,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/77445290-ssnakeplissken1997,Rating 1 out of 5,"Has the author even bothered doing the smallest bit of research in psychology before writing this? There was a lot wrong there.And I thought this was a thriller... when was this supposed to be thrilling? We were just... told a lot of things. Everything just sort of happened, I never felt that there was anything at stake or really any mystery to be solved.There was just nothing compelling about this: not the characters, not the story, not the plot ""twist"" (which was weak and not very coherent). Many storylines felt unfinished, yet I don't actually care because everything was just so bland.A few random things that made me roll my eyes:- ""Oh hey, Alicia hasn't said a word for the past 6 years and she was a famous painter: have you guys thought of letting her express herself by painting?"" OH MY GOD YOU'RE A GENIUS.- ""I've been pretty much obsessed with this case for the past 6 years, and one of the only information we have about it is the word ""Alcestis"". Wait, do you think I should read the play?""- paedophiles and child abusers aren't the same thing. A man in Theo's professional position should really know that.- no, not every child abuser has been abused themselves as a child. What the hell was the author thinking when he wrote this idiocy?- psychotherapist meets a new person: internal monologue ends with ""I wondered what their childhood was like"".Anyway, I'll stop here. This just wasn't good."
289,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/85395248-elizabeth,Rating 3 out of 5,"Jaw. On. Floor.There's that moment in The Silent Patient. The ""Wait, what? What??"" moment that you're so often promised on the jacket copy, or in blurbs stamped on the front, or--well, you know.You get promised it, but you don't really expect it. And as I was reading The Silent Patient, which takes a while to really start firing on all cylinders (which is not a plus for a shorter novel like this), I thought, ""Ok. It's a little sluggish, and if X happens, then Y will and then will get Z and--""And then R happened and I was stunned. No Z! And out of the blue, although, thinking back....damnnnnnnn! R works, and that's the beauty of it.So yes, jaw. on. floor. The twist is that good, seriously.The Silent Patient does take a while to get going, and every female character is either maternal and older or crazy, kinda crazy, narcissistic, shrewish, etc. I would have liked to see at least one female character be a little more nuanced. This is especially true in the case of the female mc, Allison. But overall (and especially because of that twist!) The Silent Patient is definitely interesting, especially for fans of psychological thrillers."

As soon as I started reading the book I knew it was going to be a good read. A good plot and great characters that you will find hard to put down.Six years ago a well known painter named Alicia Berenson murdered her husband and hasn’t spoken a word since. He was found bound to a chair with gunshot wounds to his face, and she was convicted soon thereafter. Alicia refuses to talk or give any explanation and Theo Faber who is a criminal psychotherapist jumps at the opportunity to work with Alicia.

The definition of a disposable page-turner.
 The hype doesn't always mean it's the best thing out there and this book is excellent proof of that. The Good - I enjoyed the writing. It's snappy, well-plotted which kept my interest to the last page. It is a book that does not demand much from you. It's simple and to the point with brilliant pacing.The Bad - The characters are shallow, except for Alicia. There are some major inconsistencies mainly in the form of the narrator i.e. Theo.
*Stay away for possible spoilers below*
Theo (narrator) comes off as foolish most of the times. The character we are following is meant to be intelligent, or at least a decent therapist, which he is not in this book rather annoying with his unintelligible questions. What frustrated me most is that an unreliable narrator is used only so we get the ""ultimate wtf climax"" without any genuine motive from Theos standpoint which would have worked better had the payoff been good or probably a deeper dive into Theos mind as to why it is so.The ending for me was a major let down, especially in the last few chapters. This book gave me 
Shutter Island
 vibes which if you are aware of then the ending is a no brainer.Finally, the major problem with this novel is that it doesn't know what it wants to be and ends up being a lot of things. I do feel there is a far superior story buried within this book given the premise. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this book for the pacing alone and for a debut novel, it stands tall."

The story was engaging right from the start, easy to follow and no unnecessary details or dragging. Let’s face it sometimes psychological thrillers can getIongish with so much details. The silent patient was such an intriguing story with twists and turns. As usual I was trying to guess and yea I thought I had it, but nope, the author won he definitely shocked the heck out of me.

304,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51395417-brian,Rating 3 out of 5,"“Sometimes it takes courage, you know, and a long time, to be honest.” “The Silent Patient” is a true psychological thriller. Although I thought the first 30 pages or so were a bit stupid, I read most of the book in the first day I picked it up, so it must have rapidly grabbed me. The chapters are short, each page builds on the previous, and it is a page turner. It’s also the right length. It does not belabor any point it makes.A note, don’t look for inconsistencies in the book, there are tons and it will make you nuts.In true psychological thriller fashion, no one in the text is who you think they are. It makes for some ridiculous moments, but for fun reading. I did suspect the ending well before it happened, but oddly enough that enhanced my enjoyment.There were two moments in the text that I really liked. One is a lovely comment about faith (page 57). Not necessarily religious faith, but the act of faith itself. “And if I give in to it, as an act of faith, it leads me somewhere unexpected, not where I intended, but somewhere intensely alive, glorious-and the result is independent of me, with a life force of its own.” The other was on page 101, dealing with love, “About love. About how often we mistake love for fireworks-for drama and dysfunction. But real love is very quiet, very still.”“The Silent Patient” has a clever premise, and is a perfect read for the beach or a crisp fall day. I took the book on its terms, and I enjoyed it. Just like a fun movie. And there is nothing wrong with that."
305,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82763676-piyush-bhatia,Rating 4 out of 5,"Unexpressed emotions will never die. They are buried alive and will come forth later in uglier ways. A quick - paced psychoanalytical thriller presenting a great analysis of how one's past can (read will) affect their present! The manner in which the story moved, it affirmed my belief in the thinking that the answers to the present always lie in the past, and that the answers to the future will always lie in the present.I liked the way that every chapter was around 7-8 pages on an average, giving an impression of pace and finesse of a master. So it kept me glued and I was always waiting to reach the end of the book, making it a page - turner.I was also equally impressed from the practical psychological thinking and psychodynamic thinking that was part of the book.As is said, at the heart of all arts lies a mystery. The female protagonist of the novel is a famous painter, and in one of her paintings (arts) lies a mystery that the male protagonist is trying to unravel. The true significance of the book lies not in sudden or dramatic moments but in the subtle and systematic manner in which Michaelides reveals the inner thoughts and emotions of his characters. At its essence, the novel is an outstanding exploration of character: delving not only into the psyche of the titular patient but also into the therapist who is determined to help her. The complexity and the plot twist of the story is both entertaining and analytical! A good one for a debut novel!4/5 stars"

”You know, Theo, one of the hardest things to admit is that we weren’t loved when we needed it most. It’s a terrible feeling, the pain of not being loved.”
———- 🔹Gotta say, I did 
not
 see that coming. 🔹 As someone who’s studying psychology, I have to admit that I really love anything that has to do with mental health in books. One of my favorite things in novels is when the main character sees a therapist and we get to follow them throughout their therapy sessions. I seriously adore that in books so it doesn’t really come as a surprise to me that I enjoyed reading this novel so much given that the entire premise is set in a mental health institute and we’re literally following a psychotherapist and his patient. 🔹 Thrillers are most certainly not my usual genre but I’m so glad I picked this up. It was an incredibly fast read and it was definitely interesting and as I said, I did not see that end coming. I have to pick more thrillers to be honest.🔹 The only thing I wanted to see was Kathy dying at the end (wish I was joking). I hated her with a burning passion and the fact that she didn’t even get the ending that she deserved pisses me off (I kind of wanted Theo to kill her not gonna lie loll). The ending is much more realistic in that sense however *sigh*. That said, I really enjoyed this book and I definitely recommend it!———-

Alicia shoots her husband five times, and then never speaks again.Forensic psychotherapist Theo Faber wants to treat Alicia, and he becomes obsessed with investigating her crime.I enjoyed reading this, despite not liking ANY of the characters! I don't think I was meant to like them, I think that was part of the experience, but nevertheless I think it shows what a good writer Alex Michaelides is, that I was so easily sucked into the story despite having any affection for anyone! I needed to know what happened on that night!I liked the way that the story weaved together the voice of Theo, the narrator, with Alicia's diary entries. It was quite cleverly done.I totally didn't see the twist coming. I mean I was really shocked, like chin on the floor shocked! I did have to suspend belief a little bit there, as it was very dramatic and well, a little unbelievable I guess?!But I just went with it and it blew my tiny little mind!This was a great debut, and I can see why it is being made into a film! 👍"

They are buried alive, and will come forth later, in uglier ways. —SIGMUND FREUD” ― Alex Michaelides, The Silent PatientI have seen reviews for this all over & finally got around to listening to it. Full of unreliable narrators, I enjoyed the slow unraveling of this story. I had a feeling of what was going to be the final reveal, though it played out a bit differently than I’d anticipated. Another novel that I would classify as more of a psychological mystery than a thriller. Not really any ‘jaw dropping’ moments, but still entertaining. The audio was well done and I really enjoyed the bonus interview with Michaelides at the end. It was interesting hearing his thought process in creating this story and how he had Jack Hawkins as narrator in mind while proof reading it out loud to himself. I always enjoy authors notes and have found that a lot of times they are not included in audio versions of novels. Glad audio listeners were gifted with this interview. I’ve been listening to a lot of thriller/suspense/mystery novels lately and this one just didn’t have the ‘wow’ factor as some others. Still a solid 4 stars."

I found it irritating in its depiction of women and I do not understand the hype. Writing: ★★★★★Twist: ★★★★★Portrayal of women: ★Enjoyment: ★Read more by this author?: It would dependI have to tip my hat to Alex Michaelides for his incredibly clever story structure. I won't spoil anything, but it was an impressive stitching of the narrative. Nice work, and for those who have not read many stories with that twist, I imagine it is amazing.
The Good:
-The intensive application of standard psychological evaluation practices and how it related to the narrative.-The highlighting of the inherent bias of humans, and how the psychologist is often as flawed as the patient. People are nuanced, and the people in charge are not always perfect or inherently qualified for the position. The Silent Patient was a nice commentary on who can judge who, and why, and whether that is ethical.-The journal entries kept the plot moving, and were the stronger part of the narrative as they provided most of the action. 
The Bad:
What in the world is going on with the female representation? Michaelides has created a novel that not only trivializes the voice of his female ""protagonist"" (as if she counts as such - it is clearly Theo who drives the characterizations and hold the lens), but also clearly warps and misrepresents the other female characters that exist in the novel. I understand the argument that this is dependent on Theo's interpretations of the women around him - you're only as objective as your narrator - but there seemed to be a bias on behalf of Michaelides himself. Alicia, the gorgeous (her beauty is mentioned over and over) mute who is projected upon by all those who look at her, is not a fully formed person. Even her journal entries speak to a half-formed individual. Whether you blame this lack of authenticity on the author or on his portrayal of her mental state, it is still a poor reflection of characterization and it is not helped by the fact that her entire life seems to be reactionary as she relates to the men in her life. Spoiler territory here:  1.) Alicia's Dad symbolically ""kills"" her with his hidden admission that he wishes she had died in place of her mother, 2.) Alicia seems unhealthily attached to her husband, Gabriel, to the point of hero worship and this affects all of her journal entries, 3.) Alicia's reactionary response to Max's predatory sexual advances (also he legally represents her? Messed up.), 4.) Alicia's parasitic relationship with Jean Felix and his projections on her, 5.) THEO and all of his disturbing fixations on Alicia and his projections on her character as The Muse and the woman in need of saving (which...obviously he did not save her), and 6.) The somehow neatly tied up conclusion where Alicia obviously`(?) had to kill Gabriel, as a result of her Daddy Issues.Overall, I don't think I would recommend The Silent Patient to many people. There are other thrillers that provide this twist, and frankly they have fully formed female portrayals. I hope others enjoyed this novel more than I did. Chat with me on my

And I have to say, to all the people somehow confused that the same man could have written both books I do not understand why. Both books are insufferably boring, led by characters who should not be therapists and meander for so long as to not be worth it, only to end with some thrown together excuse of a killer. I will say that here at least Michaelides did attempt to leave clues for readers along the way, it's not as out of left field as the reveal in the second book, but it's still not satisfying.Overall I hated it here. I am convinced that money exchanged hands for positive reviews about this book because I cannot understand what about this book had y'all by the throats in 2019.

Theo Faber, a criminal psychotherapist joins the staff of the Grove Mental Health Facility where Alicia is housed. He is convinced his approach at therapy can help her. His determination to get her to speak again and unravel the mystery of why she shot her husband is all-consuming for him.

I believe not having read as many psychological thrillers as the avid readers on Goodreads sometimes works wonders for me, especially when I get my hands on a gem like this. The plot and writing feel that much more original, the characters that fresh and new, the thrill of the ride that much fascinating. I'm sure there are books out there that have done this formula countless times and that you, O reader of this review, would have read some of them. Still, if you love yourself some mystery and thrill, and enjoy wonderful captivating writing, I whole heartedly recommend this book to you.The Silent Patient is totally unputdownable. One thing I would suggest, and I know with this much hype this is impossible, but still if by a wild chance you are reading this review and have not yet read much else about The Silent Patient, then go into it without exploring any further. You will love it if you read it without the prior knowledge of what it is about and what it delivers. Do not read / hear the praise beforehand, especially that which is present at the start of the book, written by other authors. I believe even the praise, or rather the hint that lies in there, gives away a little bit about the story that is probably best the readers do not know to enjoy a richer reading experience.

“ As you will see, it’s an incredible story - of that there is no doubt.Whether you believe it or not is up to you. ”

Alex Michaelides has made me a fan, and now I'm so looking forward to getting my hands on 
The Maidens

320,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57073687-nadia,Rating 5 out of 5,"I just finished The Silent Patient and now I understand all the hype. Yes, the hype is deserved!When psychotherapist Theo Faber is offered a job at a psychiatric clinic where Alicia Berenson is treated, he doesn't hesitate one second to accept it. Theo has been following Alicia's case for years, since she had been charged with a murder of her husband. Alicia has not spoken since the murder, she keeps silent, surviving day by day in the clinic under high sedation. The Silent Patient was such a smooth, enjoyable read. The story flows nicely while the suspense is building up. The story is told in two timelines, the first narrator is Theo as he is trying to get through to Alicia and make her talk. His POV is intertwined with notes from Alicia's diary just before the murder.There is something fascinating about books told from the perspective of psychiatrists. They give me chills everytime, as the psyche of a patient is being analysed and understood. I also enjoyed the analogy with the Greek tragedy Alcestis by Euripides who kept silent after she returned from the dead to her husband.It was incredible how the ending totally sneaked up on me. I had to blink twice, swipe back to the previous page to make sure I didn't miss anything, re-read the sentence and just gasp for air. Very clever ending, indeed.Many thanks to Orion Publishing Group for an ARC in exchange for an honest review."
321,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/104031480-lisann,Rating 1 out of 5,"That was the worst and most boring thriller I've read so far. The biggest problem is that it's not a thriller at all.We follow a psychotherapist who behaves like a hobby detective and has increasingly questionable thoughts throughout the book.This book was never frightening, exciting, somehow creepy or anything related to the genre. I have never been able to understand a rating on Goodreads as little as in this fictional story of a psychotherapist and his new patient. If you now think that you will at least get interesting therapy sessions, I have to disappoint you here too. Because most of the time our wannabe detective conducts one-sided conversations because his patient remains - totally surprisingly - silent.If you like to follow a story that has no tension and you are more interested in how best to interview relatives and get them to tell you almost every detail, then this book is for you. If you're looking for a thriller, stay as far as possible from ""The Silent Patient""!"

I loved seeing how this author mirrored Alcestis through a modern day thriller lens. Also, a character called Professor Diomedes!? I couldn’t decide if the author took the name from a hero in The Iliad or from the Thracian king who owned man-eating horses. Either way this was a very fascinating thriller and extremely fast-paced.

326,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26874718-effy,Rating 4 out of 5,"“Choosing a lover is a lot like choosing a therapist. We need to ask ourselves, is this someone who will be honest with me, listen to criticism, admit making mistakes, and not promise the impossible?”This is the first book I read in 2020. I've been seeing this book everywhere on Goodreads lately and I've been dying to read it. Finally, I decided it's high time I picked it up.The book follows a supposedly disturbed, mentally unstable woman, Alicia Berenson, who randomly shoots her husband, Gabriel, a couple of times, before refusing to speak for good and getting locked up in a mental institution. What is unfathomable is the fact that Alicia hadn't any apparent motive to commit such a repulsive crime given that she was an extremely talented painter and led a normal life. Theo Faber is a criminal psychotherapist who takes it upon himself to unravel the mystery of Alicia's silence at all costs.The book is mainly narrated by Theo and includes some diary entries written by Alicia as well. In so far as the writing is concerned, it is gripping, compulsive and addictive. I did not have any difficulty getting into the story and I could not put the book down.The characters were fleshed out, multidimensional and made me comletely immerse myself in the story.The plot twist at the end did not surprise me as I've seen it done in many other books. At times, I would suspect different characters the recriminatory evidence would point to. Nevertheless, what I've come to expect from thrillers is to never suspect the most conspicuous characters, falling prey to the author's manipulation.Although I was let down by the not so explosive ending that I saw coming, I have to admit that those new to psychological thrillers, hungry for a twisted roller-coaster, will probably be blown away. Michaelides excels at the craft of playing with the readers and raising untranslatable conundrums."
327,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45941903-8stitches-9lives,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Silent Patient is one of the most hyped crime novels of the past few years and for once all of the hype and hysteria surrounding it is as real and accurate as I've ever experienced before. Many of us seasoned readers know that quite often excessive advance praise can be overcompensating for something that is lacking, but not here.I cannot recommend this highly enough - it's such mindblowing debut novel, and I highly recommend it to crime fans and those who appreciate masterful writing and exquisitely crafted tales full of enough thrills and excitement to satisfy even the most discerning crime reader. This book has it all - twists and surprises galore, fascinating characters, a super-tense, ominous atmosphere which underpins it all and more depth and substance than the majority of novels in this genre; something I always appreciate. This is a masterpiece and a book that will feature in my end-of-year list for absolute certain.There are not enough fantastic words to say about The Silent Patient, so do yourself a favour and go grab a copy and get started right away. You'll simply not be able to put it down. One of my favourite reads ever. If you only read one book this year then make it this one; anything else would be sacrilege. You will not be disappointed, and like me, you won't want it to conclude either. This is one of those occasions rarer than hen's teeth when awarding five-stars feels ludicrous to me. Nothing short of phenomenal.Many thanks to Orion for an ARC.You can also find my reviews posted here on my blog."
328,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27567325-brooke---one-woman-s-brief-book-reviews,Rating 5 out of 5,"*www.onewomansbbr.wordpress.com*www.facebook.com/onewomansbbrThe Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides. (2019). Alicia writes in her diary as an outlet and to prove to her husband Gabriel that everything is fine. She doesn't want to worry him. Until she shoots him one night five times and then never speaks again.Forensic psychotherapist Theo is convinced he can successfully treat Alicia and get her to talk. He quickly becomes obsessed but if she does talk, does he really want to hear the truth?This book definitely lived up to the hype for me. It's a very clever, very well-written and engaging book. I was surprised that it is the debut novel for this author because it reads like an experienced bestseller. As per the best thrillers, there was a few red herrings throughout the narrative. I did feel that some of these red herrings weren't followed through completely enough; it became clear that they were red herrings but a couple of them could have used a bit more clarifying details in my humble opinion. The biggest twist is very intelligently done, I personally didn't see it coming and thoroughly enjoyed it. Alicia's diary was a great inclusion as it gives the reader Alicia's viewpoint even though she does not physically speak. I read this one pretty quickly because I didn't want to put it down as it was that good. I'm happy to highly recommend this entertaining psychological thriller."
