A very fast-paced story that involved a man's family into conflict once he found a precious item that could solve all his problems but that item only ended up creating new ones. And Steinbeck's writing is always emotional and I think most people who take the time to read this story will enjoy it. If you are looking for a short story about family and hardships, would recommend you reading this one. 
It is not good to want a thing too much. It sometimes drives the luck away. You must want it just enough, and you must be very tactful with Gods or the gods.
Interesting story."
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew,Rating 5 out of 5,"Steinbeck does it again. All my experiences with his writings have been fantastic. Every word, every description, every plot point, every twist - perfect!The Pearl is very short but very amazing. It is a tale of greed and how people around wealth or who come upon sudden wealth are affected. Many of us think our life would be perfect if we won the lottery, but I think all of us could benefit from the lessons in this story.I picked this book now because I am on vacation in Hatteras, NC, and the locations along the sea seemed like they would blend well with my surroundings. I was correct! Many key scenes occur at or in the ocean, and reading this while my toes were in the surf added so much to the atmosphere.Do yourself a favor and take a quiet afternoon, get away to somewhere (a beach if possible), and read The Pearl. Your literary senses will thank you!"
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2933855-brina,Rating 4 out of 5,"John Steinbeck's chilling novella The Pearl is the short story selection in the group catching up on classics for January 2017. In his retelling of a Mexican folktale, Steinbeck tells the tale of a fisherman named Kino who finds the pearl of the world on one of his dives. Showing how money is the root of all evil, Steinbeck delivers a poignant tale. First published in 1945, The Pearl is the story of Kino, Juana, and their baby Coyotito who one day discover a giant pearl on one of their fishing expeditions. All of a sudden, their entire village measures time against when Kino found his pearl. Even though fish and pearls are the source of Kino's livelihood each member of the village desires part of his newfound wealth. Rather than congratulating him on his prized discovery, each villager offers their unique suggestion as to how Kino should spend his winnings. Tragedy strikes. Coyotito is bitten by a scorpion, and Kino and Juana rush to town in attempt to persuade the doctor to treat their child. In a situation permeated with racism, the doctor of Spanish descent refuses to treat the apparent Native American Kino unless he comes up with substantial monetary payment. The only item of value that Kino possesses is the pearl, and he assures the doctor that he will be rewarded once the pearl given to brokers. Just like the doctors, the pearl brokers attempt to swindle Kino. Even though Kino has large dreams of what to do with his money, tragedies continue to befall him throughout the novella. Juana urges him to rid himself of this object that is clearly an agent of the devil. Through this folk tale, Steinbeck conveys that money is the root of all evils in the world. Underlying is a message of socialism, which was the world's response to the fascist dictators defeated in World War II. Although Steinbeck's skills as a master storyteller are evident in this novella, The Pearl does not resonate with me the way it does with others. At first I was elated that a poor villager found a jewel that could turn his life around only to see him face tragic tests. A literary masterpiece that should be read nonetheless, I rate The Pearl 4 stars- 5 for Steinbeck's prose and story telling skills, and 2.5-3 for a story that does not captivate me enough as perhaps it should."
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6431467-s-penkevich,Rating 4 out of 5,"‘For it is said that humans are never satisfied, that you give them one thing and they want something more. ’I love short Steinbeck novels. They tend towards brevity while being profuse in beauty, often written in idyllic tones that contrast with the darkness inside them. The Pearl is such a novel, a condensed tale warning against greed and materialism and a critical look at colonialism that is quite deeply moving. When a poor pearl diver discovers a giant pearl, dubbed the Pearl of the World, he thinks his luck is about to change. However, the innocence of his life becomes marred as finds that great wealth does not beget happiness but rather greed and sorrow as he must constantly defend his wealth. It becomes a parable of sorts, one that reminds us how often our possessions come to possess us and not the other way around.‘Luck, you see, brings bitter friends,’Originally began as a movie script, Steinbeck published this as a short story under the title The Pearl of the World in 1944 before expanding it to the novella length a few years later. Perhaps from that, there is a cinematic quality to the narrative here that really pulls you along. Set on the coast of the Gulf of California, which Steinbeck would later write about in The Log from the Sea of Cortez detailing a 1940 expedition with his friend, marine biologist Ed Ricketts (who is the basis for Doc in Cannery Row), Steinbeck is at home in his themes of good natured people living in poverty and the gatekeeping of society that ensures they stay this way. In many ways, The Pearl can be read as a parable of colonialism or how for the poor and colonized any attempt to rise above their status is swiftly, and often violently, dealt with. When Kino has possession of the pearl and upward mobility, the plans and evils of men conspire to take it from him and we see how his poverty of spirit would be required for the wealth of materialism (something later expanded upon in The Winter of Our Discontent). ‘If this story is a parable, perhaps everyone takes his own meaning from it and reads his own life into it.’This book has all the elements of a great tale, one that feels much older than it actually is, as if it has been a moral parable passed down for generations. There is the whole man vs nature with the scorpion attack at the beginning, man vs man with the people coming to take the pearl away, and man vs himself as Kino’s ambitions become an increased zeal to obtain wealth from the pearl. Calling it the Pearl of the World initially seems a commentary on it’s great size, but as the story progresses we see how it is much more abstract than that and a commentary on the universal nature of greed and violence in the name of wealth. Steinbeck does well to keep everything pointed and direct, but still vague enough to feel like a moral lesson that can be applied in many ways. The ending leaves much open and I sort of love that.This is a nice little book, rather devastating as short Steinbeck’s tend to be, but quite powerful and beautiful all the same. I read this originally back as a high school freshman and this is a good one for a classroom. 3.75/5"

It is the story of a pearl diver, Kino, and explores man's nature as well as greed, defiance of societal norms, and evil. Steinbeck's inspiration was a Mexican folk tale from La Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico, which he had heard in a visit to the formerly pearl-rich region in 1940. In 1947, it was adapted into a Mexican film named La perla and in 1987 into a cult Kannada movie Ondu Muttina Kathe. The story is one of Steinbeck's most popular books and has been widely used in high school classes. The Pearl is sometimes considered a parable. When Coyotito, an infant, is stung by a scorpion, Kino, his father, must find a way to pay the town doctor to treat him. The doctor denies Kino, an indigenous fisherman, out of racism, which enrages him. Shortly thereafter, Kino discovers an enormous, lucid pearl which he is ready to sell to pay the doctor. Everyone calls it ""the Pearl of the World,"" and many people begin to covet it. That very night Kino is attacked in his own home. Determined to get rid of the pearl, the following morning he takes it to the pearl auction in town; however, the auction is actually a corrupt sham and always has been. The buyers normally fake auction each pearl and pretend bid against each other, but in reality they are all paid a salary by a single man, they all turn the pearls over to him and he resells them outside the village, thus cheating the locals. The corrupt pearl buyers try to convince Kino that the pearl is the equivalent of ""fool's gold"" and they refuse to pay any more than incredibly low amounts of money. Kino decides to go over the mountains to the capital to find a better price. Juana, Kino's wife, sees that the pearl brings darkness and greed, and sneaks out of the house late at night to throw it back into the ocean. When Kino catches her, he furiously attacks her and leaves her on the beach. ...Characters: Kino, Juana, Coyotito, Juan Tomas, Apoloniaتاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز دوم ماه اکتبر سال1974میلادیعنوان: مروارید؛ اثر: جان اشتاین بک؛ مترجم: محمدجعفر محجوب؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، نشر آرمان، چاپ چهارم سال1349، در203ص، چاپ پنجم سال1353؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 20مداستان یک «مکزیکی» فقیر است، که بزرگ‌ترین «مروارید» دنیا را می‌یابد، و در دل، آرزوی خوشبختی خانواده‌ خویش را دارد؛ اما گنج، ارمغانی جز نابودی آنها ندارد؛ شخصیت‌ها: («کینو»، شخصیتی مغرور و غواصی فقیر، «جوآنا» همسر «کینو» شخصیتی اندیشمند، که نشانه‌ های هشدار را که «کینو» از پذیرفتن آنها خودداری می‌کند، می‌بیند؛ و به خاطر وفاداری، و فرمانبرداری دیرینه از همسر، یارای دیگر کردن آنها را ندارد؛ «کویوتیتو»، پسربچه «کینو» و «جوآنا»، که در آغاز داستان، عقربی او را نیش می‌زند؛ «جوآن توماس»، برادر «کینو»؛ «دکتر»، شخصیتی که فاقد ارزش‌های اخلاقی است؛ او از درمان «کویوتیتو»، تنها برای اینکه، آنها پولی ندارند، سر باز می‌زند؛ اما پس از شنیدن خبر یافتن گنجی گرانبها، توسط «کینو»، خود جهت درمان بچه، به خانه ی آنها می‌رود)»؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 19/09/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 25/08/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5524556-mario,Rating 1 out of 5,"Overall, it's just not very good. I keep debating whether I should rate it one star or two, but ultimately the Goodreads definition of the two-star rating, ""it was ok,"" pushes me over the edge. It wasn't ok; nothing about this was ok.The writing style is bad, though I haven't read enough Steinbeck to know whether his stilted, awkward prose is just an affectation for this work (in an insulting attempt to illustrate that his main characters are poorly educated), or whether he is just always like this. His treatment of his characters is truly awful. Steinbeck strikes me as the worst kind of liberal; he's full of compassion for the circumstances of his characters, but that compassion never rises above the level that any of us would have for a sick animal. At least in this work, he seems like the kind of person who loves the poor, but only for the fact that they're poor. In short, he doesn't seem to think of his characters as people, just creatures buffeted by terrible circumstances.And the moral of the story is nearly reprehensible, to the extent that it makes any sense. The reason bad things are happening to these poor creatures? They wanted a better life. Steinbeck seems to be saying, ""don't try to do anything to improve yourselves, and you certainly should never dream. Be satisfied with where you are, because trying only leads to failure."" If his moral were something like ""money doesn't bring happiness"" it would be fine, but this is more insidious, because he never even gives his characters the option of being poor and happy. His choice is a stark ""poor and miserable"" or ""poorer and more miserable."" I can just see Steinbeck rewriting the Horatio Alger stories: a sad, poor boy tries to pull himself up by his bootstraps, but the bootstraps snap, and he falls off a cliff, breaks his neck at the bottom, and his corpse is eaten by syphilitic bears.If you like heavy-handed stories with a poor moral sense and bad writing... you can still do better than ""The Pearl."""

“It is not good to want a thing too much. ..."" ~ John Steinbeck - The Pearl
Kino, like the men in his family before him, is a pearl diver in the Gulf of Mexico. He leads a meager life in a poor fishing village, living in a straw hut with his wife, Juana, and their baby son, Coyotito. Soon a series of incidents will pass through Kino's life that will impact his quiet, humble lifestyle in ways he never would have imagined... Once again, I'm mesmerized by Steinbeck's engaging and simple prose. He paints the landscape in vivid detail. His characters have breadth and depth. There is palpable tension in the air and I'm transfixed by Kino's plight. The urge to intervene is overwhelming as I watch it all play out in my head. Steinbeck takes an old Mexican folktale and turns it into an evocative novella about a man's visions of a better life who becomes blinded by his innocence. The audiobook is narrated in the soft and soothing voice of Hector Elizondo. The story transpires in a short 2H 35M listen. It's perfection!And, I had no idea The Pearl would break my heart...Highly recommended!5⭐"

""Measure your wealth by what you'd have left if you lost all your money.""
~H. Jackson Brown, Jr.Kino, an impoverished pearl diver, one in a long line of the same, lives with his wife, Juana, and their infant son in a brush hut among a colony of friends in a Mexican coastal village. They can barely scratch together enough to feed themselves, but what they lack is made up for with love. When a scorpion stings their baby, and they can't afford to pay a doctor, Kino and his wife desperately launch their canoe, searching for that elusive pearl which could mean the difference between life and death.There is something to be said for the art in simplicity. Steinbeck's scant-yet-beautiful writing style painted a vibrant picture of this family and their journey. I was wholly invested from the beginning. I read The Pearl, a novella, in the space of a few hours. Its symbolic message led me to consider the meaning of true wealth and the price we pay to capture our own 'pearls.' If you haven't read it, I highly recommend this thought-provoking tale."
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/117399210-lu-s,Rating 4 out of 5,"John Steinbeck's writing is as diverse as his literature. Nonetheless, there is a common denominator in the American author's charming writing: the story is always rooted in the orality of the tales and legends that the ancients transmit over time to new generations so that they never forget they came. Here, he is inspired by a traditional Mexican story.This little parable can be read in one go, as the writing is rich and limpid. The themes dear to the author and familiar to many of these novels are still omnipresent.Steinbeck portrays misery to raise awareness of unhappy lives, but above all, he denounces pearl fishers' living conditions, exploited and enslaved by the merchants of precious stones.He denounces protests repeatedly against the social divide and the painful and hopeless misery it generates.What brings life to life are dreams and flourishing imagination. But the goals of the poor are systematically trampled on by the most powerful.Despite a realistic but very pessimistic vision of society, all of Steinbeck's finesse illuminates The Pearl, whose melancholic music is permanently embedded in my memory."
10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1199525-cecily,Rating 4 out of 5,"“It was a morning like other mornings and yet perfect among mornings.”This novella opens with the simple contentment of a young Mexican pearlfisher: at peace with his life, wife, and baby, living in a tightknit community, and accompanied by the “Song of the Family” that plays in his mind.Pearls, by contrast, are a consequence of imperfection - possibly of pain or discomfort. But from the irritation caused by stray sand, rare transfixing beauty can occur. Unlike gold and diamonds, a pearl needs no finishing, and yet its allure arises from its imperfections: the shifting elusiveness of the watery light it exudes, the unexpectedly grainy surface, the not-quite spherical shape, and the glowing warmth it imparts to eye and skin. Be Careful What You Wish ForQuiet contentment would not make much of a story. But wherein lies the greater danger: a scorpion, poised to pounce on a resting babe, or a huge pearl that could pay for school, and thus enable little Coyotito to “break out of the pot that holds us in”?There is mystical hope when “the need was great and the desire was great”, but beware, “It is not good to want a thing too much.”Oyster being opened, source here.Fortune shines. “In the surface of the great pearl he could see dreams forming.”Fortune is fickle. “The pearl has become my soul”. Wealth brings power, and power tends to corrupt. What once offered warm lucent promise turns “gray and ulcerous”. The possession possesses him. Ultimately, this is a story of sacrifice - specifically, of choosing what and when to surrender. Make the wrong choice, and you risk losing everything. Story in SongThe people of the Gulf of California had songs for everything, though maybe only Kino hears them now. The story is encapsulated in the evolving sequence of songs (minor spoilers implied): * “Clear and soft… The Song of the Family.”* “The Song of Evil… a savage, secret, dangerous melody, and underneath, the Song of the Family cried plaintively.”* “A secret little inner song… sweet and secret and clinging, almost hiding in the counter-melody, and this was the Song of the Pearl That Might Be.”* “The music of the pearl had merged with the music of the family so that one beautified the other.”* “The music of evil, of the enemy sounded, but it was faint and weak.” * “The music of the pearl was triumphant… and the quiet melody of the family underlay it.”* “The music of the pearl had become sinister… and it was interwoven with the music of evil.”* “The Song of the Family had become as fierce and sharp and feline as the snarl of a female puma.“* “The Song of the Family was as fierce as a cry… a battle cry.”* “The music of the pearl, distorted and insane.”* “The music of the pearl drifted to a whisper and disappeared.”Faith… in What?Kino and Juana blend belief systems: ancient magic invocations, Hail Marys and prayers, and a resentful faith in the knowledge and consequent power of white settlers. A traditional remedy might be as effective as one from the doctor, but “lacked his authority because it was simple and didn't cost anything.”For those raised on Bible stories, it’s impossible to read this without thinking of the pearl of great price, the desire for which Jesus likened to the Kingdom of Heaven:“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls; on finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it.” Matthew 13:45 - 46 (KJV)But it’s an oft-misquoted proverb that comes more sadly and strongly to mind:“For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.” 1 Timothy 6:10 (KJV)For the mere prospect of great wealth changes priorities, changes people - for ever. Transfiguration is not always for the better. And the Moral Is...Unlike a traditional parable or morality tale, there is no explicit teaching point, not even a clear ending. Just a new, stark, and very uncertain beginning.“Oyster Pearl,” Hawaii, by Anna. Licensed under CC By 2.0.Steinbeck’s PhilosophySteinbeck distanced himself from Christianity over the years, and atheists sometimes claim him as their own. The Bible was certainly part of his heritage, but broader, non-sectarian social justice permeates his works. Of particular relevance to this novella:* Steinbeck grew up in California, and was always interested in Mexican culture around him.* His concern for the poor and marginalised is reflected in his writings. * He was shocked by race riots in his easygoing state, and wrote this two years later.* He was also reeling from the success and infamy of Grapes of Wrath.* This was written with the intention of its being filmed for and by Mexicans. And it was.* Steinbeck studied marine biology at university (but didn’t complete the course).Quotes* “The uncertain air that magnified some things and blotted out others… so that all sights were unreal and vision could not be trusted.”* “There is no almsgiver in the world like a poor man who is suddenly lucky.”* “So lovely it was, so soft, and its own music came from it - its music of promise and delight, its guarantee of the future, of comfort, of security. Its warm lucence promised a poultice against illness and a wall against insult. It closed a door on hunger.”* “The sky was brushed clean by the wind and the stars were cold in a black sky.”* “The land was waterless, furred by the cacti.”* In the desert, “pools were places of life because of the water, and places of killing because of the water, too.”* “He had lost one world and had not gained another.”Neil Gaiman's take on PearlsIn American Gods, Gaiman says we insulate ourselves from the tragedies of others: “we build a shell around it like an oyster dealing with a painful particle of grit... This is how we walk and talk and function... immune to others' pain and loss.” See my review HERE."

That the main character, Kino, isn't greedy, he's just a hardworking guy who wants a fair price for the pearl he found, so that he can buy everything, to give his family a better life.I disagree. I don't think it's flawed at all. I think that this gorgeous, wise, inimitable story is one about a man who forgot he had everything to begin with.(I owe John Steinbeck a LOT. He taught me to love literature at an early age. Because of him, I fell in love with words. I had to read them all. And I'm still going.

Una historia sencilla, narrada en forma clara, sin rodeos ni términos difíciles. Steinbeck logra atraparme siempre con sus libros. Al igual que como con ""De Ratones y Hombres"", ""La Perla"" nos muestra una historia en donde apreciamos la naturaleza humana al desnudo, las emociones a flor de piel en situaciones límites. No he leído ""Las Uvas de la Ira"" ni ""Al Este del Edén"", pero siento que Steinbeck es poderoso en este tipo de novelas cortas. En este libro todo gira alrededor de esa perla, cuya ""canción"", como él la denomina, comienza a infectar el alma de Kino.Ese pescador afortunado (¿afortunado?) por el descubrimiento de la gema que busca la felicidad a partir de él. Kino y Juana junto con Coyotito emprenden una travesía al estilo Sam y Frodo con una perla en vez de un anillo, pero no hacen falta 700 interminables páginas para describir la travesía, no hace falta describir enredos agotadores para lograr un efecto maravilloso en el lector. Tan sólo un objeto, una perla, que nos pregunta a todos, al narrador, los personajes y al lector: ¿tú, qué harías ante una oportunidad así?Para Kino es una bendición, para Juana, una maldición y para nosotros, los lectores, una maravillosa historia."

16,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48056505-piyangie,Rating 3 out of 5,"The Pearl is Steinbeck's retelling of a Mexican folktale. With his beautiful writing, Steinbeck tells us the story of Kino, a poor pearl diver, whose simple and peaceful life changes, irrevocably, with the finding of the ""pearl of the world"". With the newfound riches, Kino dreams of making a better life for his family, educating his son, hoping he will uplift them from the class of ""outcasts"". But, fate or evil or greed or whatever you like to call it won't let Kino see the dawn of his dream. Instead, only tragedy follows in its wake. This tragic story is gloomy and depressing. My heart went to Kino and his family. At the same time, I was feeling angry at the injustice of it all. Kino only wants a better life for his family. But his efforts are thwarted at every corner. He is cheated, threatened, and persecuted just because he wanted to get a decent sum for his pearl so he could make a good living out of it. When I read a little into the background of this novella, I saw that one of the main themes is ""good and evil"". When interpreting the theme it can only be understood that Kino's former life, the simple life before the finding of the pearl, is ""good"" and the comfortable and better life that he hopes to have with new riches is ""evil"". With it goes that all is Kino's fault. It's his greed that has been his undoing. He mustn't have dared to rise in life, to aspire to reach higher status. But that cannot be right. Steinbeck couldn't have intended that. I think the story goes deeper. It is the society that is evil, and that ""evil society' persecutes the ""good Kino"" and his innocent dreams. Society is unhappy to see its pattern change. It doesn't want to see Kino and the likes rise from their ""given status"" to a higher one. And it's not so much of Kino's greed that brings him evil, but the social norms and attitudes. This bitter truth is simply shocking and disgusting. Although thematically interesting, the story didn't quite resonate with me. There was drama and excitement, and at times suspense, but, the overall storyline was thin and weak. Steinbeck usually rouses powerful emotions within me, but here, they weren't strong. However, Steinbeck's writing compensates for this deficiency. His magician's wand (by which I mean his pen) brings to life the setting, the landscape, and Kino's thoughts and emotions beautifully. I particularly enjoyed how he described Kino's mind with reference to music. It was wonderfully clever of him. I can quite honestly say that it was his beautiful writing that absorbed me more than the story. Overall, it is not the best of Steinbeck, but still, a good read."

18,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6082517-cindy-newton,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a deceptively simple Mexican fable. It's written by Steinbeck, so of course, it's written beautifully. The story is pretty straightforward--poor, uneducated peasant finds monster pearl and now has everything previously denied to him within his grasp. Or does he?*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***Kino is happy despite his poverty and his low position on the social scale. He and the other natives in his village are under the control of the wealthy Spanish people who have taken up residence in the nicer part of town. The wealthy Spanish people live comfortably in their brick and plaster houses, exercising an iron control over the laws and economics of the town, while Kino and his ilk live in brush huts. Kino, however, is happily married to Juana, and they are both content in their relationship and with their beloved first-born son, Coyotito. The serpent enters their tropical Eden in the form of a scorpion that stings the baby--a possible death sentence. When the Spanish doctor refuses to treat him because of their poverty, Kino goes pearl-diving, laboring under tremendous emotional agony. He finds a large, obviously old oyster, and it yields a magnificent pearl--the pearl of the world. It is at this moment, when Fate drops a fortune into Kino's hands, that his real troubles begin.Okay, so as we follow Kino through the increasing complexity of the problems that develop as a result of his ownership of this pearl, many issues are raised. What, exactly, is Steinbeck saying? The old adage, ""Be careful what you wish for,"" comes to mind, and is certainly apropos. I have read that some see this as a critique of capitalism and the American Dream. Certainly Kino seems to have achieved the American Dream when that pearl drops into his hand. But that dream, his good fortune, is ruthlessly hunted and destroyed, piece by piece, by faceless individuals who could be anyone--his friends, his neighbors, or the greedy members of the wealthy community. So Steinbeck could be saying that the American Dream is a myth, that the system is stacked against those who need it the most. What about capitalism? Under the principles of capitalism, Kino should have been rewarded for bringing such a rare, desirable object into the marketplace. Instead, it is treated with contempt by those who should have been most interested in acquiring it. In reality, true capitalism was never really at play. There was no competition; the market was controlled by one person. So is Steinbeck saying that capitalism, too, is a myth? That human corruption will always interfere with the free and unimpeded flow of the marketplace?Greed is condemned in all forms, and everyone seems to feel it. After the news of Kino's find circulates, various people all start calculating how his profits can personally affect them. The doctor belatedly hurries to the side of the baby, eager to charge exorbitant fees for his assistance; the priest begins to mull pressuring Kino to donate to the church for repairs; and even the town beggars begin to anticipate Kino's generosity to them. But is Kino guilty of greed, as well? Is he reaching for too much, demanding too much, of life? He is certainly punished for attempting to have more.I teach my students that in order to determine the themes of a text, you look at what happens to the main characters. By any interpretation, the themes of this story are bleak. Either Kino allows the pearl to give him delusions of grandeur that cause him to attempt to fly too close to the sun, and, like Icarus, tumble to his doom, or Kino is an example of how a poor, uneducated person has no chance of prevailing against the system and bettering his life in any way. Not only will he not be permitted to move up, but he will be severely punished for the attempt. I personally believe it is the latter theme that is best supported by the text, but I don't believe it is a true statement about the condition of the American Dream in our country today. While breaking free of poverty is difficult to do and is a complex issue, I do not believe that people attempting to do so are faced with certain defeat, as Kino was. There are people who accomplish it, so it is doable.Steinbeck, like Charles Dickens, used his writing to fight fiercely for the rights of the poor and downtrodden, and I think that the enduring nature of their works is a testament to how very effective they were."

He stares at it as if it were a crystal ball and sees all the riches and good things it can provide for his small family. With it comes responsibility and danger when word gets out about the pearl's discovery.It is a cautionary tale reminiscent of Paulo Coelho's ""The Alchemist"", but with tense moments of desperation. W. W. Jacobs' ""The Monkey's Paw"" also came to mind.You don't need to be a fan of Steinbeck or like the two stories I have mentioned above to read this marvelous treasure. It has stand-alone greatness.Very highly recommended."
21,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15462098-kaya,Rating 1 out of 5,"This is the first Steinbeck's book I've read, though it won't be the last, despite the horrible first impression. I hate everything in this book - from it's anticlimactic writing to its incommodious characters. There is nothing worth praise in here. After I reached the end, I've been so angry and almost ready to punch something. Poor low-class man, living with his wife and their baby, finds a giant pearl, decides to sell it and then use the money to buy medicine for his child, who just got bitten by a scorpion. The selling part didn't go well, shit gets real, people die without any real purpose and it all happens in about 90 pages. In between, there are large amounts of racism, bigotry, and misogyny.The reason bad things happen to this poor family is that they wanted a better life and the guy didn't want to let anyone stop him from getting it. Basically, his wife is superstitious, tells him the pearl is evil, he doesn't listen, so tragedy happens. Steinbeck is actually telling us to be satisfied with what we are and not try seeking better options because we're inevitably going to fail in the end. Also, he justifies when a husband beats his wife and she obediently suffers because HE'S A MAN AND HE KNOWS BEST. Maybe I should've tried more to read between lines but this was too much for me. Try and see it for yourself.The narrator literally has no personality, so I don't know how I'm supposed to empathize with any of his struggles. He had some abrupt reactions, but when it comes to recognizable emotions he's pretty blank. I hate it when I can't connect to the main characters or ANY of the characters. And their difficulties were severe."

24,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18383778-dolors,Rating 4 out of 5,"“They had made songs to the fishes, to the sea in anger and to the sea in calm, to the light and the dark and the sun and the moon, and the songs were all in Kino and in his people – every song that had ever been made, even the ones forgotten.”Can you hear it? A melody shrouded in ancestral mystery can be heard amidst the roaring waves lapping at the shores of this pulsating narration. Summoning songs of despair and songs of hope, soothing lullabies and wrathful incantations, this folkloric tale unfolds between oscillating paeans to love and hate, repression and freedom, good and evil and ponders about the thin line separating the power of dreams from blinding ambition.The ritualistic tradition of simply drawn characters and linear storytelling becomes even more distinctive in this novelette, in which Steinbeck’s unpretentious lyricism blends with the gist of thought and spirit.A pearl of unparalleled beauty disrupts the life of a humble fisherman and his family and leads them to a fatal outcome following the style of classical tragedies. The impossibility of defeating fatum, that adverse destiny that enslaves mankind with the manacles of greed and pride and nurtures self-destruction is the beguiling voice and true protagonist of the story. On this occasion, lethal music embodies what is common in John Steinbeck’s books: a criticism of social injustices, a history built on rulers and subjugated, abuse and spoliation, illusion and treachery.But the dominating melody of the author’s outspoken nonconformity is not what stayed with me after I turned the last page of this slim volume. For it is in the nacreous surface, in the seductive roundness of the pearl where the real dilemma arises. Is purity of beauty more deadly than the venom of a scorpion? Is man unworthy of divine exquisiteness?Can you hear the echo of deception that hides behind the mask of flawless perfection?Steinbeck did. And so he wrote a song to exorcise mankind’s despair after realizing he can’t capture the beauty of the world neither with melodies nor with poetry. It is only the reflection of his own shadows that he is after.“If this story is a parable, perhaps everyone takes his own meaning from it and reads his own life into it.”One can only hope for fleeting moments of bliss when the vertiginous currents of poetry wash away the mediocrity of existence and cruelty is smothered with tenderness and the song of doom is interrupted by the purity of silence. Can you hear it?Steinbeck could."
25,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-sean-barrs,Rating 3 out of 5," “It is said that humans are never satisfied, that you give them one thing and they want something more.” The Pearl  is a moral allegory in narrative form; it is a revealing and instructional tale. At its very core, the novel establishes that wealth (in the form of a pearl) is not the answer to all our problems. In fact, it can create many more problems than it solves. When Kino finds the treasure, he dreams of the opportunities it can bring him. He wants to get married in a big fancy church and he wants to send his son to school. However, when he attempts to sell it, he finds himself cheated by merchants (who see him as a dumb uneducated animal) and the object of envy from his neighbors. He finds himself in a dangerous situation as he is targeted by thieves and those who would do him, and his family, harm just to get their hands on the pearl. Kino becomes obsessed with protecting it and protecting the dreams he thinks it can realize. Set against a backdrop of racial prejudice and a disparity of wealth and opportunity, the short work depicts the rural Mexican experience in the face of a modernizing world. Kino has more decency and respect for others, but often finds himself treated as lesser. He has better values, though for all his good intentions, he doesn’t quite grasp the opportunistic nature of the world. Human greed and materialism are virtues many live by. The Pearl works towards establishing how dangerous and foolish such virtues are. Overall, it is a very good novel with a powerful central motif. It is, however, somewhat vanilla, and unemotional in its narrative power. The story falls just short of greatness as it fails to capture the intensity of the human experience with its bland diction and expression. The characters don’t really drive the story forward, the pearl does, and because of the brevity of the work they never really establish themselves or develop (until the reversal at the end.)Moreover, the novel lacks a certain sense of drive and plot. Compared to the complexities of The Grapes of Wrath it’s a bit of a basic story. Indeed, the characters from of  Of Mice and Men are well crafted and deeply flawed individuals by comparison. The ones here don’t quite have chance to shine. For me, this is very much a weak novel by a great writer who has done much better. It’s certainly worth a read, but I feel it could be a much better price of writing. ___________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________"
26,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44131812-susan-budd,Rating 5 out of 5,"There are a few novels I consider perfect and The Pearl is one of them. Steinbeck’s parable is a complex symbolic story told in simple poetic language. The symbolism is built up layer by layer, like an oyster coating a grain of sand, and the result is a flawless tale, smooth and clear, like the Pearl of the World.This is the story of the dawn of consciousness: The story human beings have been telling themselves since human beings started telling stories. The story of us, what we are, and how we came to be. The perennial story. Steinbeck tells it as well as the best of them. The Pearl is fable as poetry, fable as philosophy, like the story of Genesis, like creation stories the world over, a fable that tells every story from Adam and Gilgamesh and Achilles to the Greatest Story Ever Told, the story we need to save us ~ if we will allow ourselves to be saved, to spit out the fruit, to give up the God-likeness that makes the origin story necessary in the first place. In the beginning, there is peace. La Paz. The little family lives in harmony with nature. Kino wakes up in the morning and hears the song of the family. He looks at the world around him. The crowing rooster. The rooting pigs. The waves lapping on the shore. The dog curled up at his feet. “It was very good” (1).“And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good” (Genesis 1:31).In his primitive idyll, Kino is both animal and God. Both less than human and more than human. He lives in an eternal present, like an animal, like God. He is whole. He has no ego. Consciousness has not yet emerged in Kino. He is not yet “fallen.” The songs that he hears are the nonlinear and nonverbal impressions that prefigure thought. Steinbeck’s prelapsarian man is Julian Jaynes’ bicameral man. In this preconscious paradise, Kino observes and understands without turning everything into a narrative. After his awakening, after consciousness dawns, he starts to tell himself a story: Coyotito will go to school. He and Juana will marry in the church. This story replaces his music. Thus begins the fall.Kino says each thing out loud and by doing so, he makes it real. For as all primitive people know, words are magical. “And suddenly he was afraid of his talking” (26).Kino is right to be afraid. He is already losing his “deep participation with all things” (55). The familiar sound of crickets, tree frogs, and toads has become a song of evil. He sees only his story now. He doesn’t even see the dog at his feet. He is alone, like Jaynes’ bicameral man when the voices of the gods were gone. And with the dawn of consciousness comes the expulsion from paradise. Kino and Juana “went out into the world” (68).Kino tries to return to animal innocence, but it is too late. There is no going back. He removes his clothing, replacing his white shirt with his brown skin, but to no avail. The apple cannot be unbitten. Man and consciousness are now joined as are Kino and his pearl. The only way out is through. Consciousness has overreached itself. God is dead and his absence, deus absconditus, is the fatal flaw (the Achilles’ heel) of consciousness. It is time to go under ~ like Nietzsche’s Zarathustra. To go under ~ into Freud’s oceanic feeling. Maybe microdose the water supply. To go under and live as the rest of creation lives. Not without reason. Athens had reason. Not without faith. Israel had faith. But without discontent (to use Freud’s word). All language began as poetry and all language must resolve into poetry. Pure symbolism. Blake understood this. Novalis understood this. I think Steinbeck understood this too."

I've decided to order them from my library and other sources and what ever shows up in my queue is what I read next. I just would not know what to select and want to read them all. Steinbeck's The Pearl was inspired by a Mexican folk tale he heard. It tells the story of Kino, his wife Juana, and their baby Coyotito. One day Coyotito is stung by a scorpion and Kino takes him to the dr for help. But the dr is greedy and doesn't think the payment is adequate and refuses to treat the child. Kino, a fisherman, goes to the ocean to find a pearl for payment and finds the pearl of the world. The biggest pearl that anyone has seen. And so begins this wonderful, heart breaking tale of determination, greed, evil, and family. You feel for Kino, he wants what he feel he is owed for this pearl, to make a better life for his son, but along the way becomes a different person. He becomes hunted by evil for this pearl. Oh I'm so glad I read this one, eh, listened to the audio narration. Again, another fabulous audio, this time done by Héctor Elizondo (who btw is in one my fav movies Frankie & Johnny). Love his voice and it was great to hear this story told, adding so much to it. It's very short, a little over 2 hrs in duration but such an unexpected treat.

Who among us hasn't thought that money would solve, if not all, at least most of our problems? Fortunately, or unfortunately, most of us will continue our insignificant meager existences and never know for sure whether a large sum of money will be life-changing for better or worse. Unfortunately for our young hero, kino, he had the opportunity to find out exactly how his life would play out if he came into a large sum of money. Upon finding a large and seemingly valuable pearl kino naturally starts to dream about how it'll change his life and how it'll better his family. He soon discovers the true nature of humanity, and himself when overcome by greed. The pearl takes Kino and his family on a journey that will change them forever. Would money change me?

35,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,Rating 4 out of 5,"John Steinbeck adapted a Mexican folk tale into a novella about fate, evil, the perils of greed, and the plight of oppressed people. The infant son of Juana and Kino, a fisherman and pearl diver, is stung by a scorpion. The doctor refuses to treat the baby because Kino does not have the money to pay him, and because the affluent Spanish colonialists look down at the natives. Kino dives for pearls in the hope that he could afford to pay a doctor, and comes up with a huge, valuable pearl--the ""Pearl of the World"". He hopes that the pearl will provide necessities and an education for his son someday. But a succession of violent and tragic events occur as people try to rob and swindle Kino.It was interesting how music plays a role in Kino's emotions throughout the book. He hears songs in his head that express a strong feeling--the music of the pearl. When Kino was excited about the material benefits the pearl would bring to his family, ""....the music of the pearl rose like a chorus of trumpets to his ears.""(24) When people try to swindle him, ""....he heard only the dark music of the enemy.""(53) When his family treks to another city to sell the pearl, ""....the music of the pearl was triumphant in Kino's head, and the quiet melody of the family underlay it, and they wove themselves into the soft padding of sandaled feet in the dust.""(67) As circumstances change, Kino hears different types of music of the pearl all the way to the last sentence. Steinbeck wrote a screenplay with Jack Wagner, so the music probably played an even more important role in the filmwhich was released in 1947.I've read other books by Steinbeck, and he is always very sympathetic to poor and oppressed people. This story is told in a very simple manner, like a parable or Mexican folk tale passed down orally. In the epigraph Steinbeck writes, ""As with all retold tales that are in people's hearts, there are only good and bad things and black and white things and good and evil things and no in-between anywhere.""

The back says ""THE PEARL is a book to be read many times and cherished forever."" What they're talking about, I can't imagine. If you choose to get pissed over and over again, then by all means keep reading this tragic story. I get what Steinbeck is saying in his beautiful writing voice - to be content with what is had and to not let the lure of greed drift you too far out, lest you lose everything. It's kind of like the principle of this ridiculous short story we had to read in elementary school - I can't remember it's name, but the point of the story that the teacher and book taught irritated me then too. I get what he's saying, I just don't agree with his perspective.What I take from this fable is that a man gets a break in luck in fortune, something he hopes for in order to save his child's life and better the life of him and his wife. People try to steal and rip from him his fortune with THEIR greed, and he stands strong and tries to fight back, refusing to bow to the injustice of thievery, deceit, and people trying to suck out the joy in others lives. It's a matter of principle to try and protect fortune that comes your way, whether through blessing or hard work or that rare stroke of genius. There is no shame in fighting back against the tides of unfairness to protect what is yours and to work toward something better.I can't bring myself to rate something higher than 3 stars if it pissed me off with its ending, but I can respect this book because it's John freaking Steinbeck, it's a fable that's so well done it may as well define the word 'fable' in the dictionary, and because it wasn't only the alluring pull of the pearl that kept drawing me further in."

La prosa simple pero profunda del autor logra conmover con una trama fatalista y frustrante pero nesesaria. John Steinbeck hace una reflexión sobre los anhelos de los personajes principales y sobre la codicia de los secundarios. Este trabajo tan bien logrado, lo hace en pocas páginas con específicas descripciones que llegan a crear ese ambiente familiar, de peligro y de maldad que el autor quiere transmitir. Esta corta novela del también ganador del Premio Nobel de Literatura en 1962, es una pequeña joya que todos deberíamos leer."

Steinbeck is a master!If I could, I would've read this book in one sitting, for that was what the writing demanded. An imperative, enslaving writing that transformed a common narrative into a passionate, thrilling story.

Although much of the theme has similarities to parables, I read that this book’s was also based on an old Mexican folk tale. Like Of Mice and Men, this book is a small one. It is simple in its surface only, deceivingly deep with meaning. I really like that sort of book, the ones that leave me pondering.It tells the story of an impoverished pearl diver, named Kino and his family, who one day finds a rare, impossibly large pearl. After recently experiencing hardship, the pearl seems to have been brought to Kino by fate. This find does change their lives, but instead of being their reversal in fortune and hardship, it brings something else.The book is big in scope - it caused me to reflect beyond its pages. The story reminds those who read it that wealth may not bring happiness (who doesn’t want to give that one a shot?), and it perfectly reveals how a possession can change ourselves and those around us."

La perla es una novela breve pero poderosísima. He quedado maravillada con la prosa del autor, su misticismo y su forma de abordar las profundidades de la condición humana. Los paisanos de Kino habían cantado ya a todo lo que sucedía o existía. Habían hecho canciones a los peces, al mar embravecido y al mar en calma, a la luz y a la oscuridad y al sol y a la luna, y todas las canciones estaban en Kino y en su gente, todas las canciones que habían sido compuestas, aun las olvidadas. La canción estaba en Kino cuando llenaba su cesta, y el ritmo de la canción era el de su corazón batiente que devoraba el oxígeno del aire de su pecho, y la melodía de la canción era la del agua gris verdosa y los animales que se escabullían y las nubes de peces que pasaban velozmente por su lado y se alejaban. Pero en la canción había una cancioncilla interior oculta, difícil de percibir, aunque siempre presente, dulce y secreta y pegajosa, casi escondida en la contramelodía, y era la Canción de la Perla Posible, pues cada una de las conchas puestas en la cesta podía contener una perla. Las probabilidades estaban en contra, pero la fortuna y los dioses podían estar a favor. Y Kino sabía que en la canoa, encima de él, Juana hacía la magia de la plegaria, con el rostro crispado y los músculos en tensión para obligar a la suerte, para arrancar la suerte de la mano de los dioses, porque necesitaba la suerte para el hombro hinchado de Coyotito. Y porque la necesidad era grande y el deseo era grande, la pequeña melodía secreta de la perla posible sonaba con más fuerza aquella mañana. Frases enteras de esa melodía entraban, clara y dulcemente, en la Canción del Fondo del Mar."

48,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51664350-paul-weiss,Rating 5 out of 5,"Moral fable or political diatribe? You decide!Kino is a pearl diver in La Paz, Mexico, eking out a meager subsistence living for his wife, Juana, and their infant son, Coyotito. When Coyotito is stung by a scorpion, Kino is both embarrassed and angered by the fact that the arrogant, self-centered town doctor is unwilling to help because they are unable to pay. Diving long and deep, perhaps to cool off his anger or perhaps to find an extra pearl or two so that he might have the money for his son's care, he emerges from the Gulf of Mexico with the largest, most exquisite pearl that his community has ever seen. It is quickly labeled as ""The Pearl of the World"".Thinking it to be the source of his family's future health, comfort, happiness and peace, Kino seeks to sell it to the local pearl buyers who attempt to swindle him, offering only a fraction of its real value. When the pearl becomes the target of sneak thieves in the middle of the night, Kino kills the thief defending himself, his family and the pearl that is now the central focus of their lives.Kino and Juana realize that the doctor, the priest and those already possessed of wealth in the town are angry that they should presume to step out of their station. While their friends, the other pearl fishermen, are happy for Kino's good fortune they are also jealous and convinced that Kino's sudden wealth will change him into a new person - a person that, in some fashion, will choose to distance himself from the people he formerly loved and valued.Steinbeck's story writing skills are eloquent, compelling, and impossibly tight and concise but, at the same time, exceptionally profound and moving. Steinbeck's writing is the very antithesis of the style of Charles Dickens, for example, another consummate storyteller, but one who never failed to write astonishingly complex sentences and paragraphs using an enormous number of words where one would do.For example, when Kino said, ""I am a man"", insisting that he must defend his family and his goods, Steinbeck perfectly described a woman's understanding of what a man meant when he said that:""It meant that he was half insane and half God. It meant that Kino would drive his strength against a mountain and plunge his strength against the sea. Juana, in her woman's soul, knew that the mountain would stand while the man broke himself; that the sea would surge while the man drowned in it.""On the flip side, any female reader today would appreciate Steinbeck's brief but powerful statement of his admiration of their good sense:""Sometimes the quality of woman, the reason, the caution, the sense of preservation could cut through Kino's manness and save them all.""Read on the surface, THE PEARL is a beautifully told, sadly moving parable that expounds on the often repeated childhood mantra, ""Money can't buy happiness"". A slightly more sophisticated reader will also take away the message that wealth is equivalent to power which, as we all come to know, can be its own evil leading to corruption and deceit. A deeper analytical reading, perhaps from a world-weary, more cynical adult, may give rise to the conclusion that Steinbeck was also indulging in a political criticism of the wealthy class and the authorities. Perhaps he was even expounding on the virtues of socialism, a political posture that would have been, to say the least, unpopular in the USA such a short time after the end of WW II.However you choose to read it, THE PEARL is a short novella, easily read in a mere two to three hours, that deserves to be in a library of classic American literature.Paul Weiss"

All I remember is my decision to read books in sequence they were published. Anyway it can’t be undone.
The Review:
“In the town they tell the story of the great pearl” how it was found and how it was lost again. They tell of Kino, the fisherman, and of his wife, Juana, and of the baby, Coyotito. And because the story has been told so often, it has taken root in every man’s mind. And, as with all retold tales that are in people’s hearts, there are only good and bad things and black and white things and good and evil things and no in-between anywhere.“If this story is a parable, perhaps everyone takes his own meaning from it and reads his own life into it. In any case, they say in the town that…”This small prologue tells very much of all that is in the book. From the very first page, the moment the pearl is found and on every other page one knows that pearl will be lost. But I read with the bleakest of hope that the pearl would not be lost, the pearl that has became Kino’s life and whose music, the music of pearl, played above all. Or did I read just to confirm for myself that pearl was really lost, lost to the world that comprised of pearl dealers (with hope that someone will replace the one, under whom they worked), doctor (who dreamed of going to Paris), Priest (remembering those part of church that were in need of repair) and to the city of concrete. And in midst of all this we see a stubborn husband’s struggle to save his family from all the evil that came along with the pearl. A calm wife and at the same time a mother, making futile attempt to get rid of pearl as it has laid curse upon her family. 
What’s interesting
 is the vivid description of landscape. You just do not read a story but you live the story. You see and feel everything, even that which is not perceptible to our eyes in day to day life. I remember only one book that had stark description of setting and backdrop even more vibrant ‘The Inheritance of Loss’ There is nothing much to remember from the story, nevertheless a nice story. It just feels that I am yet to read the best of John Steinbeck. "

But trouble starts brewing immediately, for others want it either cheap or by force, and things keep escalating...Written 1944-45, released in 1947, this is a story on what evil sudden great wealth can bring. This book is critical of the American dream, the selfishness of wealth. There is selfishness in the people already wealthy in the book (the doctor, the pearl-buyers, the man who chases the family at the end of the book, with his trackers, horse, and the rifle which Kino gets for himself with a bitter, crushing price). For Kino, owning the pearl changes him too, even before selling, but not completely without a good reason.The drawing in my book were a great adding to the story, giving it rough intensity. This Penguin book also has a good, if spoilery introduction.The pearl is a ""pearl of great price"", but actually a source of evil, seen even in just what song it brings into the family song of family, and the songs each part of the couple has (Juana also has the ones of old and newer religion within her). It is interesting to see where the trouble comes from, and not all people Kino and Juana are in contact with have plans for taking it, whatever ways it takes; a lot of them are just curious, excited, and having innocent thoughts of what they would do with the wealth the pearl brings.And the dreams of Kino and Juana, what they would do with the wealth, are pretty innocent too: a proper church marriage, some new clothes, a rifle, and the most persistent of them all - a good education for Coyotito, their son, the education they've never had. Kino's brother gives some wise advice, but Kino is so stubborn; still Kino's right about being wary and alert...I was also thinking about the role of Juana here, in this book. Her religious beliefs, her acceptance of her role in the family, her one attempt at throwing the pearl back into the water yet acceptance of Kino's rough, physical 'no' against this action, how she takes all the things that happen in their life after trouble rises. I think she's the balance, the 'let's see where this will go' acceptance, the wisdom. She doesn't hold the pearl except during that one attempt but does wish the same things for what it can bring.Where the things end is so raw, intense, and fading into the air: when they come back home to toss the pearl away, Coyotito dead against the back of Juana - now they are facing their son's burial, the possibility of law coming after them, an uncertain future - but they can now see the ugliness of the pearl, and as they toss it, they may have an open, grim future ahead, but they are free of this burden, the evil of its wealth-promise. The book starts with nature, and ends with nature settling down again. Their story will be a story talked for many generations, and that's another thing what makes this ending so good, and this book so good. Slim but intense kind of a (great) book."

Maybe that’s because we are in the midst of iconic metaphors—the stuff of Shakespeare, Aristotle, and more recently John Steinbeck.The Pearl, based on a classic Mexican folk tale, tells the story of Kino, Juana, and their infant son. They are simple people, whose life explodes with a scorpion bite. Poison! Poison leads to a need to pay for a bogus antidote, which leads to the discovery of the world’s greatest pearl, which leads to devastation.“I am a man,” says Kino in explanation of why clinging to the pearl at all costs is right. “It meant that Kino would drive his strength against a mountain and plunge his strength against the sea. Juana, in her woman’s soul, knew that the mountain would stand while the man broke himself; that the sea would surge while the man drowned in it.”In my opinion, this is where we all are right now—at the apex of the shift from “might makes right” to, I hope, something equally male and female. The apex is a precarious place where winds blow, people tumble into oblivion, and everything feels like life or death.Thank you, Mr. Steinbeck.

57,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28470777-mackey,Rating 4 out of 5,"I will preface this by saying that I'm a HUGE Steinbeck fan. A friend and I took the time to follow through the route of many of his books in the west just to see where he wrote, the places he wrote about it. It was one of the greatest highlights of my life. With that said, I recognize that this is not his greatest work, but it still is a great work of literature. Steinbeck is very well recognized for his lean writing style. It is what made him so very popular at the time after years of reading the verbose Faulkner who never runs out of adjectives - ever. His style of writing should be something that all Americans are used to simply from having read him in school: grade school - The Red Pony, Middle School - The Pearl, High School - Grapes of Wrath, etc. etc. Apparently not. When adding this book to my ""read"" list and re-reading today for the umpteenth time, I came across reviews from folks who did not understand the writing style, didn't understand the story - HELLO? It's literally the re-telling of a very well-known, OLD, Mexican parable. I write all of this because in today's society it doesn't matter a wit or whittle if you like this mystery or that thriller, Nobel Prize winning authors are considered Classical writers whose works were chosen because they were great, because they represent a body of work that contributed to society. They deserve more than a cursory 1 star because you didn't ""get it."" John Steinbeck wrote about the American West and the Southwest poor, native Americans and Mexicans and migrants at a time when no one else was doing so. He wrote in a language that everyone could understand. He wrote simply, to the point and yet in beautiful detail so that you - the reader - could visualize what it must have been like. To say ""the pearl was a story about an Indian who finds a pearl so his sick kid could help from a rich doctor, MEH, 10th grade reading"" tells me that the reviewer should go back to 10th grade and start over again. Perhaps there is no hope at all for us if we are incapable of reading one of the most simplest yet greatest writers of our time and understand the moral of a simple parable as well as the depth of his writing. This book is less than 100 pages long. I would think any reader from middle school forward could read it in less than a day and should be able to appreciate the beauty of the parable within. "

""Não é bom desejar muito uma coisa. Pode arredar a sorte. Basta desejá-la um pouco, porque é preciso muito tacto com Deus ou com os deuses.""

A Pérola é uma novela de J. Steinbeck - provavelmente o meu escritor favorito -, publicada em 1947. Como a sinopse anuncia, é baseado num conto popular mexicano. O tom da leitura foi-me muito familiar. Recordou-me sobretudo A Um Deus Desconhecido (1933), que é um dos meus livros favoritos. Tem a mesma carga mística, profética, quase divina desse outro volume.Uma vez mais, creio antever algum socialismo nas exposições deste autor californiano. Steinbeck volta a pegar num núcleo de pessoas desfavorecidas e atira-os aos lobos. Nesta curta leitura de 98 páginas, nem por isso menos intensa, apresenta-nos a Kino, Juana, e ao filho do casal de pescadores de pérolas, Coyotito. Kino é o chefe da família, é sobre os seus ombros que assentam os seus alicerces. Juana é o lado espiritual, a voz que procura conter os impulsos de bestialidade do bicho-humano. São nativos mexicanos, falam a ""língua comum"" há pouco tempo, e vivem à beira mar, que lhes traz a cada dia o sustento. Isolados do burburinho da cidade e um pouco à margem das suas regras, não cultivam ambições nem procuram ser mais do que são. A fonte de rendimentos é o barco que Kino herdou do pai, e que pertencera, em tempos, ao seu avô. É com ele que mergulha em busca de pérolas, que depois vendem aos negociantes da cidade.Steinbeck consegue enlear-nos em toda a sociedade de La Paz (California Sur), e apresenta-nos os muitos defeitos dos extratos que a compõem. Esses defeitos tão humanos são postos em evidência quando Kino encontra uma pérola de valor e dimensão extraordinárias. O até então pobre, ignorante e marginalizado Kino, é alvo da curiosidade de toda a cidade. Em breve as coisas escalam e a ganância do padre, do médico, dos outros pescadores e dos compradores de pérolas, põem em risco o equilíbrio sólido da pequena família de nativos que, até então, pouco tivera e menos ambicionara.Creio que Steinbeck queria mostrar os efeitos nefastos da ganância na sociedade. Diria que esta ganância é a mesma que expôs em As Vinhas da Ira (1929), quando parte da população americana perecia de fome, e a outra aproveitava o seu desespero para progredir pagando baixos salários e explorando-os até à última gota de sangue. Os princípios são os mesmos. Steinbeck deixa também claro o quão difícil é, para alguém à margem, entrar numa sociedade que é aparentemente aberta e heterogénea, plena de oportunidades, mas que no fundo é viciada e corrupta. Deixa evidente que há uma tendência para que o humano tire proveito de outro humano que se lhe apresente vulnerável. A prova disso é que, a partir do instante em que Kino descobre algo valioso, algo que desperta a cobiça de todos os outros, é como se toda a cidade se unisse para o esmagar e expropriar do que poderia significar, para ele, uma possível ascensão social.Senti as emoções que me acompanharam nestas outras leituras. Injustiça. Desespero. Uma vez mais, o autor conseguiu imprimir uma aura quase de um Jesus Cristo, ou de um profeta, ao seu personagem masculino central. E Juana, por sua vez, é como uma Maria sofredora e mãe. Acima de qualquer coisa, é mãe.Lê-se muito rápido e é uma excelente introdução à obra deste Nobel (1962) americano.Recomendo vivamente!"
62,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16907451-erin-clemence,Rating 4 out of 5,"I read this book in high school (doesn’t everyone?) and then recently re-read it, surprising even myself. Initially I had picked it up because it was such a small book, and the 89 pages were just long enough to get me through the day. I normally try and avoid massive literature greats like Steinbeck, as the easy reading I normally do helps me to escape my reality without a huge deal of thought. Anyway, Steinbeck’s story (for those who don’t know) tells the tale of Kino, his young bride Juana and their new baby Coyotito. Kino is a poor pearl diver (like his father before him), who lives very humbly in a grass shack, in a community of other pearl divers. Although the nationality of Kino is not divulged, we are told he is “brown skinned” and it is hinted at that he could possibly be early Native American, or early Hispanic (keeping in mind this book was written in the very early 20th century). Kino’s life changes when he finds a massive pearl during one of his dives- all of a sudden he has dreams for his family, his future and his son. Kino is soon overpowered with feelings of distrust (of those in his close-knit community that he once trusted) and takes his family away from the village, after frequent attacks and robbery attempts have left him skittish and scared of losing his future (the beloved Pearl). When tragedy happens, Juana and Kino blame the “cursed” pearl and return to the village they once disowned, where they are welcomed back into its folds. Steinbeck’s tale of course, speaks to the greed of humanity, the immediate distrust of others once something of value is in one’s possession, and the importance of having more than money and riches in one’s life. This small book is a quick read, and a great reminder of the important things in life. However, re-reading it now as an adult, it is evident that Steinbeck’s time and our time is very different (although perhaps I am just bitter) as I was quick to think Kino’s protectiveness of his Pearl and the immediate distrust was not entirely misplaced- I likely would have acted exactly the same way. I was grateful to get a chance to re-experience this tiny masterpiece. "

64,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22269025-robin-friedman,Rating 5 out of 5,"Steinbeck's PearlJohn Steinbeck's short novel ""The Pearl"" (1947) is unusual in that the book appeared after Steinbeck wrote a screenplay for a film of the same name. The film was released to coincide with the publication of the book. The novel is short, deceptively simple, and deservedly famous. It is based upon a Mexican folk tale and tells the story of a poor family who become, potentially, wealthy by the discovery of a pearl of rare size and beauty. This sudden wealth does not result in happiness.Steinbeck sets the stage with a short, two-paragraph preface introducing the main characters: ""Kino, the fisherman, .. his wife, Juana, and ... the baby, Coyotito."" Steinbeck describes the story as ""a parable"" in which, ""perhaps everyone takes his own meaning from it and reads his own life into it.""Kino, Juana and Coyotito are poor and and live in a simple thatched house. The baby is bitten by a scorpion and Kino and Juana become concerned for his life but have no money to pay a doctor. Kino miraculously finds a pearl of great worth and the couple dream of a better life. But from the outset, the pearl provokes jealousy and violence and leads to great unhappiness for the little family.I was moved by the figures of song and music that appear throughout the story. We are told at the beginning that Kino's people ""had been great makers of songs so that everything they saw or thought or did or heard became a song."" Kino hears in his heart various songs throughout his book, the most important of which is the ""Song of the Family"" or the ""Whole"" which celebrates his life with his wife and baby. Other songs that figure prominently include the ""Song of Evil"", the ""Song of the Sea"" and the ""Song of the Pearl"". It is interesting to follow the song imagery as the story progresses.The other part of this story that most struck me was the scenes of nature -- of the water and mountains. The theme of wandering comes through poignantly in the last part of the book in which the family struggles through mountains and valleys in an attempt to evade stalkers who are pursing them for the pearl. This last portion of the book includes much moving writing.Many people read this book as part of an introduction to American literature in high school or college. The book is accessible and short and is a highly appropriate way to get to know a major 20th Century American novelist. Still, I remember how easy it is to dislike a book forced upon a reader when young. In my own case, I did not read this book in school (I read other Steinbeck) and only came upon it recently too many years later. In any event, it is a short and beautiful story that glows with the many colors and ambiguities as did the pearl which Kino discovered and which inspired the book. This is a lovely work of American literature which the reader will enjoy getting to know.Robin Friedman"

Like the parables, the telling juxtaposes contrasting motifs of good and evil and what defines them or makes them so. How sudden wealth can corrupt depending on one’s choices, needs, or morals. Is it better to let things be or risk irreperable change for possible transformation or benefit? The reader has much to ponder throughout the pages which turn beautifully. I could hear the sounds of water, smell the woodsmoke from the fires, taste the grilled corncake, feel the tension as oppression, ambition, and greed warred with opposites. The movie Treasure of the Sierra Madre kept flicking through my head. A timeless story no doubt told in many cultures and voices throughout history, this little treasure of a book is well worth your time and could make for good group discussion."

Oh, that was unexpected! And from that point I was hooked on The Pearl.The Pearl is based on a Mexican folk tale. This is very simply written, but the message is so powerful. Kino, who is a pearl diver, lives with his wife, Juana, and baby Coyotito, near the village of La Paz, which is a pearl-rich region. The story starts off showing a simple life that they lead with daily chores and peaceful times, until one morning, during a diving enterprise, something happens that changes their lives in a way that will never be the same.At the start, we are enlightened to the thoughts of Kino. His thoughts develop into songs. He would look at his wife Juana and baby, Coyotito, and hear a certain song, a song of family. This song came through many times throughout the story. You could feel the love of Kino towards his wife and baby. There was music of evil, music of the enemy in his head. You could feel the mood of the moment with these songs. These enhanced the story beautifully.Now here is what John Steinbeck does to me with his writing. He lulls me into a reverie and makes me calm then suddenly shocks me back into reality. He starts off a section with slow melodious rhythm describing beautiful scenery and then builds to a crescendo where I find myself holding my breath until I think I’ll pass out. There are surprises at every turn.I really enjoyed reading this novella and the previous novel called Of Mice and Men, So I recommend these to everyone.*************************************نسخه‌ی فارسی (فاقد مطالب افشا کننده)مروارید...وقتی خواندن مروارید را آغاز کردم، در ابتدا مات و مبهوت توصیف‌های به اندازه و جذاب استاین‌بک از صبحی زیبا از نگاه کینو شدم. در حال لذت بردن از داستانی شیرین از مردمان امریکای لاتین بودم که ناگهان با یک سیلی در گوشم مواجه شدم که من را از خوابی شیرین بیدار کرد و چشم‌های خمارم را به مروارید خیره کرد!مروارید بر اساس یک داستان عامیانه و قدیمی از مردمان مکزیک ساخته شده، داستانی همانند سایر داستان‌های مردمان‌ امریکای لاتین که دهان به دهان چرخیده تا به استاین‌بک رسیده... داستانی ساده اما با محتوا و پیامی بسیار قوی!کینو شخصیت اصلی داستان یک صیاد مروارید است و با همسرش خوانا و فرزند نوزادش کویوتیتو، در کپری در نزدیکی روستای لاپاز در منطقه‌ای که پر از مروارید است عاشقانه زندگی می‌کنند. همه چیز به خوبی و خوشی سپری می‌شود تا این‌که صبح یک روز زیبا حین غواصی جهت صید مروارید، اتفاقی رخ می‌دهد که زندگی این خانواده را دست‌خوش تغییر بزرگ می‌نماید.در آغاز داستان، ما با با افکاری که در ذهن کینو می گذرد آشنا می‌شویم. افکاری که توسط استاین‌بک به اهنگی شیرین تبدیل می‌شود و او عاشقانه به همسرش و فرزندش می‌نگرد، گویی این آهنگ نقل عشق است، آهنگی از یک عشق واقعی که می‌شد در صفحات آغازین آن را با پوست و استخوان خود حس کرد. البته همه‌چیز در افکار کینو به عشق منعطف نمی‌شود و او همانند سایر مردمان امریکای لاتین و صدالبته پیشینیان خود ترسی دائمی از شیطان دارد که این شیطان می‌تواند ارواح پلید باشد یا هر دشمنی که خانواده‌اش را تهدید می‌کند. تقابل این افکار در ذهن کینو، به زیبایی‌های این داستان و شروع جذابش قدرت بخشید.و اما استاین‌بک... درست همانند موش‌ها و آدم ها، مرا با داستانی شیرین، ملایم و روان همراه کرد، سپس با بیان موضوعی در داستان من را تا مرز سکته پیش‌ برد! در تمامی سطرهایی که نوشته پر است از شگفتی و من از خواندن دو رمانش لذت بردم و خواندنش را به سایر دوستانم نیز پیشنهاد می‌کنم.بیست و چهارم آذرماه یک‌هزار و چهارصد و یک"

La perla che dovrebbe indicare il mezzo per arrivare alla salvezza, alla fine di rivela un demone.La storia è ambientata in un villaggio poverissimo, i protagonisti sono una famiglia come del luogo: il papà Kino, la moglie Juana e il piccolo Coyotino che un giorno improvvisamente sarà morso da uno scorpione. Inizia così la storia, fatta di momenti di sventura, di rabbia ma anche di speranza per il piccolo, grazie al dottore ricco che vive in città che rappresenta un polo opposto della famiglia protagonista.Una parabola in cui la perla indica letteralmente il miracolo, l’incantesimo dell’istante, una sorta di rivelazione. La storia viene costruita sullo scontro tra mito del mondo pastorale e le rovine del mondo reale: due mondi opposti che si scontrano da sempre: la povertà da una parte e la ricchezza dall’altra. Un libro che indica un rito di passaggio: dalla semplicità rurale della campagna agli intrighi della civiltà istruita."

It meant that he was half insane and half god.This novella is certainly a triumph. It is a feat which anticipates Papa's Old Man and the Sea. I expected bleak but this lumbered past my expectations. Steinbeck understood fury. He preferred to drape it in righteousness but understood it was foundational, a default code. This was my first Steinbeck in close to 25 years. I was moved more by the tidal poetry than the spherical songs of Kino's imagination. Steinbeck is generous with his gestures. He understood our unspoken nature. Kino felt success was literacy, an ability to parse the codes. The novelist knows better. I would have enjoyed more tension, more detail and certainly more developed characters.

Kino had found the Pearl of the World. The essence of the pearl mixed with essence of men and a curious dark residue was precipitated. Every man suddenly became related to Kino's pearl, and Kino's pearl went into the dreams, the speculations, the schemes, the plans, the futures, the wishes, the needs, the lusts, the hungers of everyone, and only one person stood in the way and that was Kino, so that he became curiously every man's enemy.
The Pearl is based on a Mexican folk tale in which the life of an impoverished fisherman, Kino, alters after he finds the greatest pearl in the world. Stunned by this unexpected stroke of luck, a hopeful, guileless Kino sees this as his only chance for a way out of debilitating poverty and a big step towards things out of his reach – education, wealth, success, position, and respect.  The glimmering promise of the pearl seduces him and everyone around him, filling their hearts with greed and violence. This novella is a quick, fast-paced read and all the action gets wrapped up in under 90 pages. The last few pages are incredibly tense and they made me uneasy because the pearl made Kino and his young family vulnerable to all kinds of dangers. The characters are simple, the language is unadorned, coupled with a taut narration. Kino's brave and impulsive nature is balanced by his calm and reasonable wife, Juana, who recognizes the evil inherent in the pure moon-like gleam of the pearl, a metaphor of uninhibited ambition and greed.Conversation between the characters is limited and to an extent substituted by music (verbal background music) which provides a different character to the narrative, reflects the thoughts, moods, and emotions, and expresses what words can't convey. Allow me to play the 'song of the family', one of the main musical themes:
...And the rhythm of the family song was the grinding stone where Juana worked the corn for the morning cakes. ...Juana sang softly an ancient song that had only three notes and yet endless variety of interval. And this was part of the family song too. It was all part. Sometimes it rose to an aching chord that caught the throat, saying this is safety, this is warmth, this is the Whole.
Similarly, there is the song of the evil which is a savage, secret, and dangerous melody. Sometimes, these songs act like musical clues, the undertone adapting itself as the story progresses – Kino's increasing obsession with the pearl can be read in these musical motifs:
...And the music of the pearl had merged with the music of the family so that one beautified the other. ...And the music of the pearl rose like a chorus of trumpets in his ears... But the music of the pearl was shrilling with triumph in Kino.... And the music of the pearl had become sinister in his ears, and it was interwoven with the music of evil.
 There are two film adaptations of this book,  Mexican and Indian (Kannada), and I want to observe how they brought this background music to life. For me, not an extraordinary book and probably not the best example of Steinbeck's writing, but it manifests the ideals he valued the most. He had deep compassion for the poor and the marginalized and many of his works are about the hardships and injustices that these innocent, morally grounded people face. In 'The Pearl' he sympathizes with the ordeals of the indigenous people of Mexico, a country he dearly loved, suffering under hundreds of years of Spanish colonial rule. The deeply entrenched claws of racism leave people like Kino on the fringes of society, holding on to their dignity and fighting for survival."

E questo lo si dice per disprezzo, mentre è una delle più belle doti della specie, quella che ha reso superiore l'uomo agli animali, che si accontentano di quello che hanno.»La storia che racconta Steinbeck è una storia senza tempo e senza spazio.È una storia antica come il mondo, quella dell'uomo che cerca nella provvidenza il proprio riscatto e confida nell'improvviso colpo di fortuna per avere la propria rivincita da un presente che annienta e opprime, che sogna di cambiare vita e vede aprirsi davanti ai propri occhi, grazie a quella fortuna, nuovi scenari e favolose opportunità.È quello che sogna anche Kino, povero pescatore messicano che abita insieme alla moglie Juana e al piccolo Coyotito in un villaggio di capanne ai margini della città.La loro è una vita semplice e povera, così povera che non possiedono nulla e quel nulla gli basta fino a quando il piccolo Coyotito viene punto da uno scorpione e si accorgono che quel ""nulla"" non gli consente di pagare il medico per salvare il bambino.È a questo punto che Kino, che sembra essere spinto sott'acqua non solo dalla rabbia, ma anche da una forza soprannaturale che lo guida, trova ""la perla"".È il sogno di tutti, trovare ""la perla"", e nella sua superficie traslucida vede riflesso il proprio futuro, quello del figlio che imparerà a leggere, una vita più facile e forse priva di preoccupazioni; ma non si accorge, Kino, che la perla ha un'anima nera che attira l'invidia e sconvolge rapidamente la piccola comunità.È una visione pessimista quella di Steinbeck - a nessuno è concesso un colpo di fortuna capace di migliorare la propria esistenza senza che questo trascini con sé invidia, avidità, disgrazie; ma, soprattutto, questo, non è concesso ai più poveri, a chi nella società occupa i gradini più bassi, gradini dove devono rimanere - ma è una visione narrata come al solito con uno stile impeccabile e una prosa sempre ricca, capace di creare sospensione, speranza, illusione e rappresentare in poche pagine tutti i mali dell'umanità.La perla è il simbolo di tutto quello che vogliamo ottenere senza il sudore della nostra fronte, del risultato senza il sacrificio, del ""tutto e subito"": il nostro tredici al Totocalcio, il sei al Superenalotto, il primo premio alla Lotteria di Capodanno, e così via.A volte può essere una fortuna, molto spesso distrugge.Anche questa volta stendiamo un velo pietoso sulla traduzione che però, in questo caso, fa pendant con un'edizione piena di errori altrettanto disastrosa."

Oh, my, that was unexpected! And from that point I was hooked on The Pearl.The Pearl is based on a Mexican folk tale. John Steinbeck had heard the folk tale while visiting La Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico, and was inspired to write this novella. This is very simply written, but the message is so powerful. Kino, who is a pearl diver, lives with his wife, Juana, and baby Coyotito, near the village of La Paz, which is a pearl-rich region. The story starts off showing a simple life that they lead with daily chores and peaceful times, until one morning, during a diving enterprise, something happens that changes their lives in a way that will never be the same. At the start, we are enlightened to the thoughts of Kino. His thoughts develop into songs. He would look at his wife Juana and baby, Coyotito, and hear a certain song, a song of family. This song came through many times throughout the story. You could feel the love of Kino towards his wife and baby. There was music of evil, music of the enemy in his head. You could feel the mood of the moment with these songs. These enhanced the story beautifully.Within this story you will see that Kino and Juana are very savvy to the ways of the outer world, the world outside of their grass-hut village, the world of “stone and plaster”. Juana’s strength is very evident throughout and you develop a respect for her, she is not one to be pitied because she is so strong. Now here is what John Steinbeck does to me with his writing. He lulls me into a reverie and makes me calm then suddenly shocks me back into reality. He starts off a section with slow melodious rhythm describing beautiful scenery and then builds to a crescendo where I find myself holding my breath until I think I’ll pass out. There are surprises at every turn. I loved the message that came through this folk tale. It makes you stop and reflect on your own life; what are we trying to achieve? Hmm, do I really want that Castle high on the hill? Is it worth all that stress and aggravation? I don’t think so. Let me live in my little grass hut and be comfortable and healthy. I really enjoyed reading this novella. I recommend this to everyone."

Gracias a la insistente recomendación de mi padre y por donarme su ejemplar, me aventuré a leerlo con mi queridísima Isa, compañera infinita de lecturas.«La Perla» narra el hallazgo de una familia indígena que se encuentra en la miseria más absoluta de una perla de incalculable valor. Es entonces cuando las esperanzas de una mejor vida endulzan con sueños su porvenir. Lo que no habían previsto es la aparición en su máximo esplendor de la maldad del ser humano, la distinción de clases y la avaricia y codicia que reflejan el ansia de tener un posicionamiento mejor en un mundo absolutamente injusto.Nos encontramos ante una parábola que está narrada con soltura, agilidad y sorprendente belleza. A veces tenemos pensamientos erróneos sobre la profundidad que podemos encontrar ante un escrito corto pero este es un claro ejemplo de una construcción narrativa perfecta. No falta, ni sobra ninguna frase y nos ofrece un final que sella una historia bonita de una manera exquisita.Aborda varios temas sobre la condición del ser humano pero también explora y critica el racismo a los indígenas y la superioridad que siente el hombre blanco y cómo trata de aprovecharse de ello. La única pega que quiero destacar es el trato que recibe nuestro único personaje femenino que asume su papel de inferioridad ante su marido en varias ocasiones durante la novela.En definitiva, en esta andanza de ir descubriendo pequeñas joyas de la literatura ha sido una grata sorpresa encontrarme con este precioso relato. He sufrido, he aprendido y me he entretenido enormemente desde sus primeras páginas. Ideal para leer del tirón, para sensibilizar con otras realidades y para darle el valor a nuestra humilde pero cómoda existencia."

I read this in school and then many years later as an adult, and I still really enjoy it. Something about the stubborn will of the main character appeals and repulses. You could say the theme of pushing that fine line between simply providing for one's family and out-and-out greed is even more prevalent in America over the last few decades than when The Pearl was published. Perhaps the resulting blind mania and desperation too?"

110,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4542979-kim,Rating 4 out of 5,"A jewel of a novella, short, suspenseful and moving, The Pearl is the re-telling of a Mexican folk tale. It's the story of Kino, a poor pearl diver, who finds an enormous pearl. He sees it as the path to dignity for his family and an education for his son, but it brings tragedy instead. Essentially a parable, a central message of the work is to be careful what you wish for. The message is obvious from the text and there's nothing subtle about the way in which it's presented. On the other hand, Steinbeck's prose never fails to speak to me, with its beautiful descriptions of the natural world and wonderful use of simile and metaphor. I think of Steinbeck as a compassionate writer with a deep interest in people and the environment in which they live. This is something which shines through the work. "

Believing they are now rich, the fisherman formulates plans that will allow him and his family to live a better life. The plans are modest and include sending their baby son to school, formally marrying his wife in a church, and buying a rifle. The PlotA young fisherman discovers a large pearl. Believing the pearl will afford him great wealth, he dreams of a better future for his young family. Society, however, gets in the way of his plans and he is forced to flee until a tragic event leads him to conclude that the pearl does more harm than good.Socio-economicKino's fisherman village (natives) is segregated from the rest of the town (descendants of their spanish conquerors). Kino tries to fight his station by selling the pearl. It is the wealthier in town who destroy Kino. The doctor prescribes false treatment to Kino's child (initially refusing to even see the baby when he discovered his father was a fisherman). The priest will only marry them once they have money Kino's attackers were undoubtedly from the town. The trackers eventually kill Kino's son. It wasn't God or fate that destroyed Kino, it was the greed and materialism of society. Religious beliefs reinforce society's ability to subjugate Kino and his people.MaterialismThe materialism evinced by the townspeople grips Kino. Rather than be satisfied with the happiness of his family, he seeks a way to improve, and this leads to the tragedy. Eventually he regains his way by ridding himself of the pearl, but not before a great tragedy befalls him.The song of the familyThe song of evilQuotations:- ""And, as with all retold tales that are in people's hearts, there are only good and bad things and black and white things and good and evil things and no in-between anywhere."" - Preface.- ""But they remedy lacked his authority because it was simple and didn't cost anything."" - Chapter 2- ""For it is said that humans are never satisfied, that you give them one thing and they want something more.

117,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9822645-jon-adcock,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Pearl is an adaptation of a Mexican folk tale and deals with themes related to materialism, greed, and man’s capacity for evil. The plot is simple: Kino, a poor, Mexican pearl diver, finds a huge gem one day and dreams of bettering his life and the lives of his wife and infant son, but the pearl soon brings him only tragedy. It’s Steinbeck, so the writing is excellent and the book offers a sympathetic portrait of Kino and his family. In keeping with Steinbeck’s support of the exploited and oppressed, the book touches on the class and racial divide between Kino’s indigenous people and the Spanish upper class who exploit them:“Kino hesitated a moment. This doctor was not of his people. This doctor was of a race which for nearly four hundred years had beaten and starved and and robbed and despised Kino’s race, and frightened it too, so that the indigene came humbly to the door. And as always when he came near to one of this race, Kino felt weak and afraid and angry at the same time”The book isn’t without some flaws and, in particular, the gender roles are somewhat dated and might cause some readers to roll their eyes:“There was no anger in her for Kino. He had said, “I am a man,” and that meant certain things to Juana. It meant that he was half insane and half god”All in all, the book is worth reading and touches on some of Steinbeck’s classic themes."

Based on a Mexican folktale. Kino, a poor diver, finds a rare pearl of great wealth. Their life in a modest brush house by the sea appears to be transformed, and the promise of a better life for him and his family. Yet security and riches are not the only things that come along with its beauty. Themes of the nature of man, greed, evil and love connect to form a tragic story."

124,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,Rating 3 out of 5,"Part parable, part allegory, this one could just as easily have been subtitled: Neo-Colonialism, A Harsh Guide to Action. I found the fact I was in the head of ‘the Noble Savage’ throughout and listening to the music of hate or of anger or of family or whatever else that was playing in his mind just that bit too patronising. You know, patronising enough for it to become quite irritating. The fact that the third world is unable to cast away those things that make us first world types view them with avarice and desire makes this story’s moral (which I take to be that one should be contented with one’s poverty, as riches often end up costing you much more than you would otherwise ever choose to pay) all a bit disgusting and reprehensible really. But the writing is clear and the story well told. His attack on the greed of both the colonialists (as symbolised by the trickery of the Doctor, the Pearl Dealers and the goons who follow) and of the Church is utterly clear and unrelenting – there is no question where Steinbeck’s (or the readers’) loyalties lie (or are supposed to lie). More than half a century later, perhaps one can understand the utter bleakness of Steinbeck’s vision here. This allegorical portrayal has been a fairly accurate prediction of subsequent US involvement in its own ‘backyard’ – but still, I think stories of this kind work better if the reader is left with some sense of hope in the end. At the end of this even the future has been stolen and all that is left is the ability of the protagonists to throw away their only chance for a better life. It doesn’t get too much more bleak than that."

The whole plot of the book is given away in the introduction. So my advice to anyone that also as this edition of this book: Skip the intro and read the novella first!I thought the Pearl was a wonderful little story and John Steinbeck is an absolutely amazing writer. He is one of my favourite authors. Steinbeck's stories are poignant and full of reality. He describes everything so wonderfully that I could picture it all so clearly in my head. The Pearl is a very basic story, but everything is the novella also has a double meaning, which is extremely thought-provoking. The novella is a parable for modern times, even though it was written in 1947. The moral for the story is money doesn't always bring you happiness and good things. And some people will do whatever they can to take advantage of you."

129,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41690236-octavia,Rating 5 out of 5,"""It is not good to want a thing too much. It sometimes drives the luck away. You must want it just enough and you must be very tactful with God or the gods."" After reading this novella, I have to read more literature by John Steinbeck. This is actually my first time reading his creative words and I was Mesmerized…This novella unfolds as a parable regarding Kino, a poor Mexican pearl diver (who finds a pearl) and his family. With finding this pearl, Kino begins to ""See"" a better Life for his family. This author reveals greed, envy, and materialism with this short read. This novella weighed so heavily on me that I immediately read it a second time because of destructive greed and ambition. Throughout this entire novella, John Steinbeck shows readers the Important words, ""go with God."" In spite of that, Kino allows this pearl to bring much destruction without listening to his wife until the ultimate loss. This is a must-read. Beautifully written but, so sad. "

The American Dream operates on some basic assumptions: opportunity is always equal, competition is always healthy, and individuals are necessarily good.""Whatever your economic idealogy, Steinbeck didn't play around when bucking the status quo. He was all about the underdog, the indigent, the poor, and the unfortunate, and he wrote about them often. This novella, based on a fable that he heard when working in the Sea of Cortez, is one of Steinbeck's top 5 better-known works. There are themes of colonialism, poverty, and greed throughout, warning us to not be ""those people"" who are more privileged and treat others like crap. But there is also the theme that even if you aren't ""those people"", and you get extremely lucky by finding a massive pearl or winning the lottery or whatever, and do your best to try to better yourself, shit is still gonna happen (and happen often) if you are one of the underprivileged trying to get into a privileged world. ""Luck, you see, brings bitter friends.""Of course, there are some serious gender issues in this story. It is becoming so common in the classics that I read that I now just do a cough and an eyeroll and move right along. Kino at some point turns into a domestic abuser while 'The Song of the Family' is running through his mind. It was a little harsh, and I could have done without Juana being hit and kicked for being the smart one in the couple. But damn if Steinbeck didn't write it beautifully.Five stars from me. "
131,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23224475-ema,Rating 4 out of 5,"É perigoso avaliar preto no branco, porque a vida nunca será assim, mas trata-te de uma parábola, por isso vamos analisar o livro por aquilo que ele é. A posse da pérola na história traz-nos logo maus agoiros, senti- até agoniada porque já estava a prever a escalada que culminaria em desgraça. A moral da história prende-se, então, na ganância desmedida, que é característica do Homem, nunca está satisfeito com o que tem e que quer sempre mais, e é através dela que advêm desgraças e tragédias. Na minha opinião, é perfeitamente natural e saudável querermos melhorar a nossa vida, a ambição é necessária para crescermos, mas quando ela se transforma em sede de poder e dinheiro, deixamos a nossa essência e passamos a ser algo que nunca fomos e a fazer coisas erradas, que um dia pensámos impossível de acontecer. É muito importante que tenhamos a capacidade de largar algo que só nos está a fazer mal e que, muito provavelmente, não nos levará a bom porto. Ensinarmos às nossas crianças que está tudo bem em não ter aquela consola xpto ou ensinarmos a nós mesmos que está tudo bem em não ir de férias para uma ilha paradisíaca todos os anos, só trará pessoas mais equilibradas."
132,no user info,No Rating,"Probably the worst book I ever read, this book can be described in a few sentences. First, Kino found a pearl, bad things happened, he threw it back. Even if it had a great plot, in real life it doesn't even make sense. Sure all books have an element of fantasy in them but they have roots in the truth. for example, all of the spells in Harry Potter comes from Latin plant names. For example, when Kino carries his dead son, he saw his son in the pearl. Psychologists call people who see other people in things mentally insane. This is exactly the situation Kino is in. Why throw away the biggest pearl in the world when one could give it to church and get sent into heaven through prayers. If religion is the first thing Kino thought about when he first got the pearl, why not give it back to god. After all, God gave the pearl to the people in the first place. Isn't it common courtesy to give something back after you borrowed it? Not only that I feel like John Steinbeck is hugely sexist towards women. He described the stomach of women as jiggly. What kind of a person compares the stomach of women to jelly?"

Bunun belki de en sade ve kısa örneği, bu minik kitaptır. Çocukluğundan beri bir türlü okumaya fırsat bulamadığım kitabı aradan çıkarayım istedim.Gazap Üzümleri, Bitmeyen Kavga gibi kitaplarında insanı içine alan, sarıp sarmalayan tasvirci anlatım bence İnci için bir doz fazla. Ancak yine de gerçek bir edebiyat örneği. Yalnız para hırsının insanı ne denli acımasız ve yok edici bir yaratık haline getirdiğini gözler önüne seren öykü, bazı noktalarda birazcık iki boyutlu ve gerçeklikten uzak kalabiliyor. Toplumsal gerçekçi tarafının kamufle ettiği bu özelliğini geçersek, Steinbeck Amerika'nın Yaşar Kemal'idir desek hiç yanlış olmaz.

134,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1330063-kelly-hunsaker-reads,Rating 4 out of 5,"Althought this is Steinbeck, and therefore brilliant it is my least favorite of his books. I think one reason is valid and the other probably not. First, one of the things I love most about Steinbeck's books is that he is writing about real events which he witnessed firsthand, mostly in his own backyard. It gives his stories a deeply resonant truthfulness. It also allows his unique compassion for people to shine. This book feels much less personal and for that reason I liked it less. Second, I already knew how the story ended. A couple of years ago my son read it in school and was very angry at the climax of the story and shared with me how much I would not like it and exactly why. I remember as a teenager my family and I went to see the movie Jaws long after most... and none of us were frightened or shocked. We had been anesthetized. I believe the same happened to me with this novella.Having said all that ... I give it more than 3.5 stars and less than 4 --- so I have rounded up. Because, after all, it is Steinbeck! "

I am now bringing my review to Goodreads.Kino, a poor pearl diving fisherman's infant son has been stung by a scorpion. A doctor won't treat him without payment. So, Kino needs to find a way to do so. He finds a large oyster with a giant pearl that he names ""The pearl of the World."" News travels fast around the village. They are jealous about the sudden wealth. The doctor treats the child, and is promised payment once Kino sells the pearl. But there are thieves lurking. His wife is concerned about the pearl's influence on the family, but Kino feels it is their only hope. This short novel was published in 1947 and made Steinbeck a celebrity overnight. This is a message book with interesting learning lessons and was perfect as a book selection, rich with topical issues for discussion. What did the pearl represent? 3.5 stars. "

Is it Kino’s fault that, because he is trying to protect his sudden wealth, it becomes his soul? I feel like his need to protect it is justifiable. I am more angry at the people who destroyed his life trying to take what was rightfully his. If they would have left him be, there would have been a “happily ever after” ending. But that was not to be because things could never be that easy. I’m sure he never thought that his sons life would be the price he would have to pay for his own. I was surprised when he returns to the village instead of continuing on after his son was dead. Would he have been haunted by his wealth because it would forever be overshadowed by his sons death? Or was the wealth only for his son and now that the son was dead he didn’t care. I like the story and the questions it caused me to ponder. "

This novel will make you think way less of those beautiful luminescent balls of sand and oyster spit.Kino, an impoverished but plucky native who makes a living diving for pearls off the Baja Peninsula in Mexico. He lives with his wife Juana and his son Coyotito who unfortunately gets stung by a scorpion. Juana calls for the doctor, who has very particular requirements for his patients—namely, that they have lots of cash. Kino and Juana go to the doctor’s house anyway, but their race and poverty work against them. The doctor won’t treat Coyotito, so Kino goes pearl-diving in the hopes of hitting the jackpot. He finds a really big pearl but at the same time Coyotito miraculously heals himself. The word spreads that Kino has a really big pearl and everyone comes to see the pearl and the family is dragged into a vicious circle of greed and corruption.This books showcases a lot of different themes related to Primitivity. Greed: Every character in The Pearl demonstrates some sort of greed; it is presented as an unavoidable, universal human characteristic. Steinbeck paints an incredibly simplistic portrait of greed. It is always evil, it always corrupts, and it brings nothing but suffering.Wealth: Wealth is proportional to evil in the book. The more wealth a character possesses, the more evil he is. Wealth is so highly valued, men make extraordinary sacrifices in its name. Power: Every character in The Pearl abuses his or her power over someone weaker. The doctor, the priest and every other person but you can't say who is guiltier.

149,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13908931-ariel,Rating 4 out of 5,"During 1940 Steinbeck, along with his friend Ed Ricketts, set sail for six weeks. The two traveled from ""Monterey up the west shore of the Gulf of California to Angeles Bay and then across to Puerto San Carlos east and south to Agiabampo Estuary."" The result of their travels being Steinbeck's and Ricketts' Sea of Cortez: A Leisurely Journal of Travel and Research. After a night of beers with natives of La Paz on the Isla Espiritu Santo, Steinbeck and Ricketts' were invited to check out the town of La Paz. It is amidst Steinbeck's account of the three days spent in La Paz that he mentions the story that he would eventually rewrite as The Pearl. Initially a tale of a boy and his pearl seeking his divine three (clothes, booze, and sex), Steinbeck rewrote his Pearl into parablesque form. Playing on the biblical parable of The Pearl of Great Price (Matthew 13:45-46 NKJV) he layers this short but significant read with the voices, songs, and characters of Kino, Juana, and Coyotito.In Kino we have a father that carries the weight of the wealth and health of his small family and the village, both neighbors and extended family, they live in. His character is complemented by Juana with whom Steinbeck exhibits the wisdom of the mother and the pragmatist, the active nurturer of both husband and son. Both parents have strength and intensely delineated merit in their presumed roles in both village and home but Steinbeck does a very good job of furthering this and letting it flower into the reality of a relationship. Even as it becomes a relationship strained. The reader is quickly dosed with the vulnerability of Coyotito and, in turn, his parents and the balance of their life, the ""Song of the Family,"" by a scorpion sting. But it wouldn't be Steinbeck if it didn't have layers! Coyotito is also an embodiment of joy, hope, and then grief. The child coming in and out of focus as we travel along with Kino on his trek through psychological development. The weight and shadow of Kino and Juana's return to their village and the pearl's return to the ocean. I think Steinbeck's parable of the fallacies of a materialistic culture is important and well written. It's very much the tossed pebble rippling of the pond; his layering of characters, situation, action is awesome. I was surprised at how much depth his use of melody added to my connection with the story. It added a primal feel; a glow of the often told legend as it sparks from lips around a fire and resonates. I think The Pearl is a new favorite. Which is something I seem to say after every Steinbeck I read. I can't help it; Steinbeck does rawness, hope, grief, strength, futility, 'regular' folk, and the importance of the shining humane act so well. His writing makes me want to reach out into the world and change something, change myself. "

152,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,Rating 4 out of 5,"Question: Are you somehow trying to complete your 10th grade summer reading list retroactively? I mean, ""The Great Gatsby,"" ""Of Mice and Men,"" and now, ""The Pearl?""Answer: No. I'm trying to hit my 100-books-a-year goal, and found myself a bit behind after reading some long books this year. So I Googled short classics and have been reading these books to close that gap. Because I would love to squeeze in a Pynchon before the end of the year if at all possible.Okay... to my review of ""The Pearl."" A simple parable populated with good versus evil symbolism. It ponders greed and reveals it to cause people to grow jealous and murderous -- even good people like the fisherman Kino after he discovers the ""pearl of teh world,"" and expects that it would net him a fortune. Even the wealthy, better educated people in Kino's town dupe him, wanting their share of his bounty. Greed -- and the stifling oppression caused by poor education and limited information. One could call these the leftist-themes of ""The Pearl.""But there is another theme that runs contrary, and is almost conservative. Kino's luck makes him stand out. People -- and the gods in Kino's musings -- seem to dislike that. He is being judged for breaking the status-quo of the village. Spanish-descneded overlords on top, serviced by the Catholic Church, which upholds wealth. And the aboriginal Mexicans firmly under that heel. ""Don't Rock the Boat."" This also seems to be a theme. It seems right-wing to me, order upheld and progress dangerous. Moralizing aside Steinbeck is an amazing writer. The prose is lucid and immediate. Deceptively simple, Steinbeck gives several contradictory themes to follow as illustrated above. Great little book."

In other words, this book is a complete abomination and utter waste of time to read. Not only is it a waste of time, it is so short that it doesn't even deserve to be a novella. Regardless of how short it was, the ending was so abrupt and made all the details of the entire story pointless. John Steinbeck did an excellent job of TEACHING ME THAT ALL YOUR HOPES AND DREAMS GO DOWN THE DRAIN WHEN YOU TRY TO SELL A PEARL. Kino effectively ruins his life in the end of the story and is probably a wanted criminal now. If you have read this book and like it, I can tell that you had no clue what was happening in the book. KINO BEAT HIS WIFE, HIS SON DIED, AND HE KILLED AROUND 4 PEOPLE; THAT IS NOT A GOOD STORY. There was no resolve to any conflict except that he chucked the pearl into the ocean after all of this. Good job Kino."

157,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62404723-fred,Rating 5 out of 5,"UPDATED REVIEW: (2020)One of the most powerful books ever written - just as brilliant as I remembered.This book focuses on the importance of family, the importance of integrity, the consequences of base things like greed, wealth, and fame getting to people’s heads...and most of all, the disastrous consequences of when that same greed provokes humans to turn on each other. Leagues past Of Mice and Men!(P.S. This was one of the first classics I ever read. It was the January after getting my Kindle for Christmas; I read this and haven’t stopped reading classics since.)——————————————————————————————————ORIGINAL REVIEW (2017):The general synopsis is as follows: this book follows a family of three who live in a brush hut and their names are Kino, Juana and Coyotito, their baby. Kino is someone who hunts for pearls and eventually finds a colossally big and extremely valuable one. This book is very much based on what the pearl does to their lives and what evil and greed it brings to the family and how it affects them and what it does to them.This book will grab you by the throat but in a really unexpected way. It is very slow-paced, it is very much focused on the writing and the very gradual setting development. This book was written absolutely beautifully and it shocked me because I usually love books with loads of really good character development and admittedly this book has none but when the first dramatic thing happened in this book, I gasped for breath out loud because even though the characters were not developed, I felt connected to the story almost immediately because the writing was so beautiful and captivating and it completely grabbed me by the throat. This book is still, however, very dramatic. I’ve never really seen anything like it: I’ve never read a short story that has had me holding my breath this many times. It was so dramatic yet it was still really slow-paced and focused on the writing and setting which I loved. This book has a lot of really mixed, interesting themes which I found really fascinating. It focuses very much on music and music created from the atmosphere around the characters. It also focuses on psychology of the mind and how society works and how humans work and how greed can turn into deceit and how evil takes over the mind and provokes you. I really liked all the themes and I thought they were written and dealt with superbly. If you like really dramatic stories, this book may be for you but you do have to be prepared for a slowly paced book that is not purely focused on plot, as some dramatic books are.However, having said all this about the writing, if this book didn’t have its really dramatic and touching and poignant plot, I would probably have given this book 3.5 stars which is still a good rating but the plotline enhanced it further. This book’s plotline is extremely poignant and beautiful and will leave you holding your breath, not with excitement, but with shock and anticipation mainly. This book’s plot made me feel things and I am trying to spoil as little as possible here but at the end of the book, one character does die and that made me sympathise hugely with these characters, I felt it gave the story that poignance to it and that much flavour and meaning. So to end this review of The Pearl, the writing completely blew me away, the plotline completely blew me away, the pace was really slow and controlled, focused and perfect and I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would. I gave it five stars and I do not usually rate short stories as more than four stars but I am very passionate about this book so I felt I ought to. Brilliant book. :)"

159,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63944124-francesca-calarco,Rating 4 out of 5,"John Steinbeck’s The Pearl, while short, made a lasting impact on my understanding of socio-economic injustice after first reading it as a kid. Now, revisiting it as an adult, I still find it to have great relevance. That said, there were some stylistic choices I was not overly impressed with. I know most people are generally keen on Steinbeck’s inclusion of “music” in the tale, but it did not heighten dramatic elements for me, so much as pose as a distraction. That choice aside, I did enjoy the overall use of language and thought it worked well at setting the stage of the fable. As for the characters, neither Kino nor Juana are exceptionally inspiring characters, but that choice plays a role in Steinbeck’s narrative focus on the lives and trials of ordinary people. They exist as male and female caricatures to facilitate commentary on elements that constitute masculinity and femininity. While I do not necessarily agree with the rigidity of this dichotomy, Steinbeck’s emphasis on the necessary balance of these diverse elements is something I can accept. Now what is great about The Pearl, is the brutal and honest portrayal of the human struggle to raise oneself higher than the station they are born into. This is brilliantly illustrated with the passage, “The loss of the pearl was a punishment visited on those who tried to leave their station. And the Father made it clear that each man and woman is like a soldier sent by God to guard some part of the castle of the Universe. And some are in the ramparts and some far deep in the darkness of the walls. But each one must remain faithful to his post and must not go running about, else the castle is in danger from the assaults of Hell” (50). People are constantly trying to make sense of their place in the world and understand why the status quo is what it is. When it is a wide-spread cultural or religious assumption that to work and aspire to more is inherently bad, is when you know you’re living in a system actively working to justify its innate injustice and prejudice. Righteous retaliation for work or luck should not be a natural assumption, but it is in both this tale and real life. That is why the fable still resonates with me today."

This is a parable, a lesson, a telling not a showing of how greed can get into a persons heart and blacken it against everything that is true and good.Some people always seem to strive for more, more money, more things, more power, more recognition and usually as with The pearl it doesn't turn out well.I'm not saying don't be ambitious, not saying settle for anything, not saying don't be the best you can be, but look at the price you're paying for those things. Is it worth it? I found this one difficult and very preachy on many levels. The reason for the 3* is some fine writing. But the story irked me a lot.

167,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"O foarte scurtă, dar și frumoasă și tragică poveste a revoltei omului împotriva unui sistem social fracturat între clase distincte, între pescuitorii și negustorii de perle. De data aceasta, Steinbeck a mutat conflictul social dintre muncitori și proprietarii de teren la nivel mitologic, ambiția lui Kino, cel care a reușit să găsească Perla Lumii, ""cea mai mare perlă din lume"", de a lupta împotriva tuturor celor care doresc să-l deposedeze de singurul lucru prețios pe care-l deține, eventual oferindu-i o sumă derizorie în raport cu valoarea perlei, amintind de îndârjirea greviștilor din Nehotărâții sorți ai bătăliei sau de aceea a fostului reverend Jim Casy din Fructele mâniei. Cu mențiunea că decizia acestor oameni de a se împotrivi produce un fel de seism interior, înverșunarea lor marcându-i iremediabil (și nu întotdeauna în sens pozitiv).Însă aceasta este doar o față a acestei narațiuni în care personajele principale sunt cei doi soți, Kino și Juana, împreună cu copilul lor, Coyotito. Putem interpreta revolta lui Kino împotriva negustorilor și ca pe un conflict între valorile ""sălbaticilor"" și cele ale omului modern, privit drept ""civilizat"" și ""civilizator"", deși meschinăria și barbaria celui din urmă par să spună o cu totul altă poveste. În fine, fiecare cititor are libertatea să interpreteze așa cum dorește Perla lui Steinbeck.Din punctul meu de vedere, punctul forte al cărții stă în expresivitatea poetică cu adevărat extraordinară, în pendularea dintre realitate și vis, ca și cum nu ar fi deloc limpede în care dintre acestea putem plasa povestea de viață a familiei lui Kino. Iată un fragment relevant: ""Deşi dimineaţa abia începuse, totul era învăluit într-un miraj nedesluşit.

But why be surprised when the great author who wrote of merely 50-pages or so decribed every greed and societal misfunctions expressing gleefully how we destroy our own?The Pearl inspirational which can be also considered parable, a lesson to morals. Kino and Juana begs the doctor to treat their infant son, Coyotito who was bitten by a scorpion. The doctor who was fat, eyes puffed with good nights sleep, still in his nightwear and having chocolate drink in bed threw them away for what does poor people have in payment to the doctors treatment. Luck strikes when Kino finds a pearl with which he builds dreams in that very moment - to legalize his marriage, to buy clothes, to educate his son and so much more. But tragedies befall on Kino and his family and the culprit being the Pearl?This book conveys the evil of the world, money or human? The doctor, the auctioneer, the people are among the shrouded criminals. Here racism and poorness makes the people vulnerable, Kino faced tragedies for which he will forever suffer the lose. This little masterpiece was so well written that had me pondering on my greedness of slathering nuttela on both sides of the bread. Because if today I'm this much greedy how greedy am I going to be tomorrow."

También hace referencia a la importancia de la educación para no ser pisoteado por los demás, una cuestión que me parece una gran enseñanza del libro.Realmente le hubiera puesto 5 estrellas, pero hay algo negativo que aparece y que no puedo omitir, que es el colocar a la mujer en el lugar de subalterna del hombre en la pareja. Entiendo que es una característica de época de cuando fue escrito y la época en que transcurre la historia, pero me resultó chocante porque es un pensamiento de el personaje mujer como diciendo mi lugar es este, por debajo de mi marido."

They tell of Kino, the fisherman, and of his wife, Juana, and of the baby, Coyotito. And because the story has been told so often, it has taken root in every man’s mind. And, as with all retold tales that are in people’s hearts, there are only good and bad things and black and white things and good and evil things and no in-between anywhere.

*** تم ندخل للقصـة لنتعرف عن حكاية اللؤلؤ ، الذي دمر حياة انسان كل ما ارده هو ان يري طفله يقرا و ان يحصل علي حفل زفاف رسمي في الكنيـسة 
 And he said quickly, “We will be married in a great church.” And in the pearl he saw Juana with her beaten face crawling home through the night. “Our son must learn to read,”"" و قال بسرعه "" سوف نتجوز في الكنيسه "" و في اللؤلؤ شاهد جوانا مع و جهها المصفوع عائدة الي المنزل عبر الليل "" ابننا يجب ان يتعلم القراءة ""

Let us destroy it before it destroys us. Let us crush it between two stones. Let us—let us throw it back in the sea where it belongs. Kino, it is evil, it is evil!”""كينو ، هذا اللؤلؤ شرير ، دعنا ندمره قبل ان يدمرنا ، لنحطمه بين الصخور ، دعنا - دعنا نعيده للبحر حيث ينتمي ، كينو ، انه شرير ، شرير "" 
يحاول كينو ان يثبت نفسـه و ذاته من اجل زوجته و طفـله 


He had said, “I am a man,” and that meant certain things to Juana. It meant that he was half insane and half god. It meant that Kino would drive his strength against a mountain and plunge his strength against the sea. Juana, in her woman’s soul, knew that the mountain would stand while the man broke himself; that the sea would surge while the man drowned in it. And yet it was this thing that made him a man, half insane and half god,


 و في نهاية القصة يتحول كينو الي شخص اخر ، شخص متوحش ربما شرير 

There was sorrow in Kino’s rage, but this last thing had tightened him beyond breaking. He was an animal now, for hiding, for attacking, and he lived only to preserve himself and his family

174,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7406091-missy-j,Rating 4 out of 5,"A timeless classic and parable. Steinbeck was inspired by a Mexican folktale when he wrote this story of a poor Mexican pearl diver Kino, his wife Juana and their son Coyotito. One day Kino finds an extraordinary pearl that is as large as a seagull's egg. Kino is convinced that he can get a lot of money for this pearl and that this will be the way for his family to be lifted out of poverty. Unfortunately, things don't go as expected. Despite its shortness and simplicity, the story is infused with a number of different themes - poverty, greed, oppression, colonialism, family - to name a few. I personally enjoyed the different songs that were playing inside the head of the protagonist. The song of family when he watches his wife and son and hears his wife humming a lullaby. The song of evil when he feels danger and fear. The song of the pearl whenever he sees it glistening. Kino was blinded by the pearl. Juana was superstitious and saw it as an evil thing. The pearl buyers tried to cheat Kino, while the doctor and the priest were also self-interested. A very well-written, universal story!"

Για άλλη μία φορά ο μεγάλος Αμερικανός συγγραφέας παίρννει μία ιστορία φαινομενικά απλή και με όπλο το συγγραφικό του ταλέντο τη μετατρέπει σε κάτι το εξαιρετικό. Η ιστορία, όπως μαρτυρά και ο τίτλος, περιστρέφεται γύρω από ένα μαργαριτάρι μεγάλης αξίας που έρχεται ξαφνικά στη ζωή ενός φτωχού ανθρώπου και την αναστατώνει. Γρήγορα, όμως, οι ελπίδες που του γεννά για ένα καλύτερο μέλλον διαψεύδονται καθώς έρχεται αντιμέτωπος με τους ανθρώπους γύρω του και την πλεονεξία τους αλλά και με τους εσωτερικούς του δαίμονες που η προοπτική του πλούτου τους κάνει να ξυπνάνε. Με λίγα λόγια μία ιστορία ελπίδας και απληστίας που το κύριο μήνυμα της είναι ότι η ευτυχία και η δυστυχία δεν έχουν και πολλά να κάνουν με τον πλούτο, ειδικά σε ένα κόσμο από αυτοί που κυριαρχούν έχουν όλα τα μέσα για να τον ελέγχουν και να αποφασίζουν για τη διανομή του.

The closest novels to The Pearl that I can think of are The Old Man and The Sea and The Treasure of Sierra Madre - stories of men fighting against the bad cards that life had dealt them.I think it's time to revisit some of my old time favorites by Steinbeck"

189,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48327873-markus,Rating 4 out of 5,"THE PEARLBy John Steinbeck (1902-1968)In a small fisher village down south by the Gulf of Mexico. Kino was a pearl fisher. With Juana his wife and his newborn son Coyotito, he lived in a brush hut surrounded by a brush fence. The fishing community lived along the beach in same brush huts, each surrounded by a brush fence. To sell their pearls if they found any, they would go to the village nearby. Kino was a dreamer and however poor, he considered that he had all a man needs to feed a family. His two treasures were his son and his fishing boat inherited from his father, who had it also from his father, and he from his father.One morning, as a ray of sun fell on the ropes that held the hanging box in which Coyotito was sleeping, a tiny movement drew their eyes to the light streak. Down the rope, a scorpion moved slowly.The baby moves, the scorpion drops, and strikes before Kino could reach the box. He smashes the devilish insect but he baby screams. Joana tries to suck as much poison as she can from the wound. Followed by all the fishing community they run to see the doctor in town. The Doctor sends a servant to the door, but when Kino and Joana cannot provide payment, the door is closed on them.Back home, Joana applies the traditional treatment and prays to God. She includes in her prayer the wish for her husband to find a good pearl in the ocean, to pay the doctor, to save the baby. So they board their fishing boat and far out there Kino starts diving deep. He is young and robust and can dive over two minutes at a time.  And by a miracle, he brings up a big old oyster, and as he opens it, he finds an enormous pearl.  The biggest he had ever seen. As big as a birds egg. In the surprise, he screams out loud, and all the fishermen come to look at the treasure, the biggest pearl in the world. It is a sensation, and the news of the catch travels like a bushfire through the fishing village and the town. Kino starts dreaming of what he will do with all the money and most of all he wants to send his son to school, for him to learn how to read and to know what is written in all the great books.The doctor now comes to Kino and Joana's brush house and insists on curing the baby of the scorpion sting. The poor fisherman is unable to refuse such authority, and the doctor pretends to provide the last minute saving medicine.  He does not forget to ask for payment which Kino promises after the sale of his pearl, next day.Next day Kino and Joana, followed again by all the fishermen, go to town to see the pearl buyers. To his great surprise, they all tell him that his pearl has no great value, for it is too big and of no great use in jewellery. He gets an offer of 500 to 1000 dollars. Kino realizes that he is about to be cheated and refuses to sell his pearl and they go back home. After thinking about what to do, they decide to go to the City of La Paz, as soon as next morning, to find a serious buyer. But in the dark of the night, Kino hears some noise of footsteps outside, he takes his hatchet and wants to check it out, but before going far he is attacked by three men, he can smash one of them to the ground but then gets hit and falls and faints. Joana has run after him and helped him back up. Now they realize, that their pearl is wanted by some people by all means. They now want to take their boat to flee immediately. But when they get to it, they find a big hole in the bottom of it. Their boat had been destroyed. When they go back to their brush hut, they find it on fire. Luckily the baby is with Joana. Kino and Joana realize that their troubles are getting bigger and bigger. Joana wants to through the pearl back into the sea. But Kino refuses. He wants his son to go to school. Now the two of them pack the baby, some food, and water and flee in the dark of the night to the north, towards the mountains. They walk all night and rest a little in the morning. As they start climbing the hills towards the mountain Kino can in the distance three men following them. Two trackers on foot and a rifleman on horseback. Now he knows that he and his wife cannot escape. That he will have to challenge them at the right time. And he prepares a plan. As we are now coming close to the outcome of the story, I will have to leave it to my fellow readers to discover the destiny of this family, just two days ago so happy and contented, but now, like criminals so hard-persued. A reminder for many of us that happiness is not where we are looking for it."

I was so shaken last night after I finished the last page, it actually took me while to fall asleep!As usual, Steinbeck had me at the first sentence. I can't think of more than a small handful of writers who can pack a punch like Steinbeck. Whether you're reading one of his epics or a thin 97-page novella as this was, Steinbeck was able to take me on a ride with a full knowledge and feeling of the players and setting and theme. And in a sparse prose that I've seldom seen replicated. Truly an American master.I will throw one small ""criticism"" in here - even though I stand by my 5 stars completely. I will say that the story was NOT enjoyable. Prior to this, I just finished a well-written, enjoyable story that I couldn't wait to read each night. It was jarring to read this book next and thank god it only took me 2 nights, because I don't think I could stay in that sad world much longer. In fact, it was very devastating and only offered a small hint of hope. But everyone should read it once. It's your social duty. It's the kind of story that will make you want to be a more generous, caring person. "

After all, this is Steinbeck! Kino, a Mexican native, finds 'the pearl of the world' off the coast of his little village and his world is about to change. The discovery of this pearl was comparable to one of us winning the lottery and I thought it amusing that the first visitor that he got after striking it big was the church. For a novella, 97 pages, The Pearl is a powerhouse of emotion. There were some characters who really pissed me off and I felt like they were some loose ends that were never wrapped up or I would have easily given this 5 stars. Still, this is entertaining. I don't want to get into 'the moral of the story' and all that rot, yada yada yada... yeah, a poor man striking it rich and the repercussions that follow. I'll spare you that and just say, take my word for it, this is a damn good yarn!"

200,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60782354-cuong,Rating 5 out of 5,"guys i just found my new favorite author!!!-Hạt ngọc trai của John Steinbeck là một cuốn sách có dung lượng không dài nhưng đầy sức gợi. Ở trong nó bao chứa sự chồng chất, dồn ép của nhiều đề tài, sớm đã trở thành đặc trưng trong văn chương Steinbeck ở giai đoạn trước và xuất hiện cả nhiều đề tài sẽ tiếp tục được ông khám phá ở giai đoạn sau: sự bất bình đẳng giai cấp, sự xung đột quyền lực, mặt trái của chủ nghĩa tư bản và mối tương quan giữa cá nhân với cộng đồng. Hạt ngọc trai bắt đầu vào một buổi sáng yên bình tại một làng chài ven biển, nơi con người sống chan hòa cùng tự nhiên, nơi cộng đồng cùng chia sẻ cho nhau những bài ca đẹp được bện dệt từ sợi chỉ văn hóa và những tương hợp về mặt bản sắc. Nhân vật chính của truyện là Kino, một người thợ mò ngọc trai nghèo. Một ngày nọ, Kino vô tình tìm thấy được Hạt Ngọc Trần Gian - viên ngọc trai khổng lồ, hiếm thấy, có giá trị bằng nhiều gia tài cộng lại. Hạt ngọc không đơn thuần chỉ mang lại cho anh viễn cảnh đổi đời, quan trọng hơn, nó còn là liều thuốc cứu sống cho đứa con trai vừa bị bọ cạp chích - đứa trẻ tội nghiệp đã sớm bị tên bác sĩ duy nhất trong thị trấn từ chối chạy chữa vì anh có không đủ tiền.Thông qua quá trình khắc họa tình cảnh của Kino, một điển hình cho số phận của những người dân chài miền biển - một cộng đồng người bản địa da đỏ, Steinbeck đã mở ra một mệnh đề bất bình đẳng giữa cuộc sống của họ với với cuộc sống tiện nghi, “văn minh” của những kẻ trong thị trấn - một cộng đồng da trắng. Cũng bởi lý do đó, Hạt ngọc trai còn có vai trò như một bản cáo trạng phản ánh mặt tối của xã hội - một xã hội đầy rẫy những chênh lệch về mặt giai cấp, kéo theo đó là những xung đột quyền lực, sự thiếu công bằng trong chiếm lĩnh tri thức và những suy thoái nghiêm trọng về mặt đạo đức. Ở đó, những người dân chài là nhóm yếu thế, không chỉ xét tới việc họ là những cá nhân của một cộng đồng có mức sống thấp, mà còn ở việc họ luôn nằm trong ở vị trí của những kẻ “bị trị”, là hệ quả của thứ quyền lực thực dân đã xâm hại, cải biến, cướp đi không chỉ đất đai mà cả cội nguồn văn hóa, tấm căn cước danh tính của chính họ suốt cả hàng thế kỷ tồn tại. Khác với không khí yên ả, bàng bạc trong sách màu cổ tích ở phần đầu truyện, có thể thấy, bầu không khí xuyên suốt Hạt ngọc trai là những căng thẳng chồng chất, những diễn biến bạo lực leo thang và đỉnh điểm là những cái chết. Nhìn từ góc độ phê bình xã hội, có thể cho rằng những sự kiện xảy tới và cách ứng xử của những nhân vật trong truyện đồng thời cũng là một sự sụp đổ nối tiếp của các giá trị. Đặc biệt, đối với Kino - chủ sở hữu của viên ngọc trai, nó còn có phần phức tạp hơn thế nữa. Ở đây, viên ngọc trai không đơn thuần chỉ có giá trị về mặt thương mại, trong thiên truyện này, bề mặt sáng bóng, lấp lánh rực rỡ của nó còn hiện lên như một tấm gương soi chiếu bản chất con người, nhất là trong những hoàn cảnh tăm tối khi con người bị vật chất chi phối. Đối với những tên tư sản trong thị trấn, những người ở làng, viên ngọc trai bóc trần bản chất tham lam không đáy được thai nghén và nuôi dưỡng bởi dục vọng. Đối với Kino, nó mở ra một một hành trình không bằng phẳng, bắt đầu từ việc kiến tạo những ảo vọng, tới dã man hóa để thực hiện bằng được ảo vọng, rồi cuối cùng là nhận thức được sự sụp đổ của ảo vọng để trở về với ánh sáng của nhân tính. Ở đây, Steinbeck vừa chứng minh được khả năng so sánh xuất sắc khi ông mô tả quá trình đối sánh mối quan hệ giữa các cộng đồng người, vừa tỏ ra đặc biệt thành tạo trong thao tác tách biệt cá thể để đi tới mổ xẻ, phân tích thế giới bản năng, các khía cạnh động cơ của con người. Cũng vì lý do đó, Hạt ngọc trai còn có tầm vóc như một tập tư liệu nghiên cứu tâm lý người đặc sắc, đồng thời là một thiên ngụ ngôn có sức sống bền bỉ về vấn đề lựa chọn ở một con người, về hành trình tranh đấu đầy đau đớn nhưng đáng trọng khi con người bị đẩy giữa lằn ranh Thiện - Ác. Như đã đề cập ở phần đầu đề, Hạt ngọc trai là cuốn sách có dung lượng hết sức khiêm tốn, song khả năng gợi mở của nó có thể nói là vô tận. Đối với mối độc giả, khi cầm trên tay cuốn sách này, mình cho rằng họ - dù ở bất kỳ độ tuổi, giới tính hay nền văn hóa nào, khi đã trải qua một khoảng thời gian đồng hành cùng Kino, chắc chắn đều có thể tự rút ra cho mình những bài học đạo đức khác biệt. Hạt ngọc trai có lối hành văn rất đẹp. Một-trăm-năm-mươi trang truyện là một-trăm-năm-mươi bức tranh bảng lảng trong khói sương, trong bầu không khí đậm đà vị biển và những thanh âm vang vọng của tự nhiên, của cộng đồng. Ngôn từ Steinbeck sử dụng không kiểu cách, hoa mỹ song vẫn không kém phần gợi cảm. Nó có sức nén cao độ, có khả năng chuyển tải ngữ nghĩa đầy uyển chuyển, phong phú, rất gần với ngôn ngữ thơ. Đọc Hạt ngọc trai, quả là không ngoa khi nói dường như, Steinbeck đã khiến mình một lần nữa sống lại trong tình yêu đối với ngôn từ - thêm một lần và mãi mãi về sau./ "

And this marks the third time I have read my own life into it. It's fascinating to discover how things have changed over the years.When I was very young, I found The Pearl to be a simple story about a naive young family. It didn't live up to the hype and I was rather bored by it. Something made me want to revisit it twenty years later and I remember being struck by the tragedy of the baby's violent death. I was filled with pathos and rather ashamed that this hadn't affected me when I was younger. This third read through was prompted by my IRL book group. Everything old is new once again.Steinbeck's novella is loaded with Biblical allusions, including the conflict between obedience to God and worship of Mammon, expulsion from the Garden, and wandering in exile through the desert. He expanded upon all of these themes a decade later when writing East of Eden, but they are quite powerfully explored in miniature here.It's nice to feel like I have finally connected with a classic."
205,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is a very powerful book that's mostly about deceptive treasures - finding certain things that are out of reach to be of utmost importance, or getting to excited about material goods. I really liked how this book shows us that family and our own ways of life are to be appreciated and maintained for their sake, that we shouldn't cast aside the way we want to do things and pursue earthly treasures or the ways that others (in this book, the white folks) do things. Kinda like a story about pulling away from external pressures, and I can see how it could be looked at anew in the context of America pushing its culture around the world. Umm okay my imagination got a little too far out there... anyway, it's a really well written book, as I expect from Steinbeck, and it's short so it's easy to get wrapped up in from cover to cover, if you've got a couple hours."

Con la exquisita prosa del autor, que describe tan bien las escenas, que te envuelve y te introduce en ellas, como si fueras uno más de sus personajes.En este ""pequeño"" libro, nos habla de cómo el dinero, la codicia, la envidia... puede llegar a cambiar nuestras vidas. De cómo la riqueza, o el sueño de poder tenerla, hace salir a flote lo peor de las personas. Y nos hace replantearnos que es lo que tiene valor realmente, que es lo que da significado a nuestras vidas.Todo a través de la experiencia de un pobre buscador de perlas, que ve cómo su sencilla vida junto a su mujer y s su bebe, cambia radicalmente en el momento que encuentra una perla enorme y valiosisima.

Mas aquilo que inicialmente se afigura como um golpe de sorte do destino revelar-se-á, na verdade, uma maldição.Enquanto lia o livro sentia que ele preservava algo que encontro nos clássicos gregos e romanos: personagens e acontecimentos que se estabeleceram já na mente dos povos, histórias que se espraiem e que sobrevivem nas bocas durante gerações, até ao momento em que alguém se senta para as registar e fixar: e Steinbeck tece uma narrativa como quem pinta um quadro, constrói cenários onde nos dá sempre coordenadas precisas para sabermos onde nos situar e nenhum pormenor é descurado. Este é o segundo livro que leio do autor e já começo a sentir-me mais confortável a partilhar a opinião de que adoro a escrita de Steinbeck e que continuo ansiosa por continuar a explorar a sua obra."

I have read only 'Of Mice & Men' so far besides this one, but I think it's safe to say I simply love Steinbeck's writing style.

218,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147516783,Rating 4 out of 5,"""The Pearl"" is about a family in a poor village. The man of the family, Kino and his wife, Juana, had a lovely baby. Unfortunately, a tragedy struck at night when the baby was stung by a scorpion. The family needed to find a doctor to heal their son. However, the doctor was racist, selfish and arrogant. He healed people for money. As soon as he heard that a dark-skinned family was asking for his assistance, he quickly refused to help. So Kino set out to the lakes, hoping to find a valuable pearl to sell. Against the odds, he found ""the pearl of the world"", as the villagers called the pearl. Then, the doctor pretended to heal his son and attempted to steal Kino's pearl. It also led to many chaoses in the neighbourhood, so Kino decided to run away with his family. They had to escape from the people who were going to catch them and had various attempts to acquire a rifle. But the stories ended with Kino and Juana returning to the village, and Kino threw away the pearl he found. Overall: 4/5This book is shorter than any other book I've read recently. I am surprised by the uneventful resolution and literally no plot twists.  (Maybe I read too much angst these days ;-;)  It doesn't have a complex plot, yet it conveys meaningful messages and portrays the characters well. First of all, the doctor was simply despicable. I don't understand why people think darker-skinned people are less capable of doing things. Also, I don't think he should be a doctor if his life goal was wealth. However, I really admire Juana's character. She was a woman and a mother in her family. Although she was very strong-minded, she was still respectful to her husband. She willingly put her life at stake by sucking the scorpion's poison for her son. The author described her eyes were cold and hard, like a lioness. Her eyes reflected that Juana was very tough, and not all women were fragile and couldn't face hardships. The main message to me was the paradox of the pearl. Something so beautiful and valuable could be extremely dangerous and evil due to human nature: greed. Human wants were unlimited. Once they had achieved something, then they would continue to achieve more. Kino found ""the pearl of the world"", which was precious, and his desires for his son's education and marrying Juana officially would be fulfilled. However, in the course of protecting the pearl, he also committed sins and killed somebody in self-defence. It could be scary and ugly to see the greediness of human nature revealed. "

Which also equals saying that stereotyping and categorizing are valid methods of understanding your fellow man. it struck me really early on that the book was going to discuss this graph, slope, pyramid of how people's positions are placed, told through the very sort of accessible magic of a folk tale. I could never really tell by the end of the story if through kino's fighting this hierarchy as an individual and being crushed the moral of the story is to highlight the horrible injustice of this hierarchy or the stupidity of even trying to fight it? The story starts with a little introduction into the nature of folk stories ""as with all retold tales that are in people's hearts, there are only good and bad things and black and white things and good and evil things and no in-between anywhere"" and I thought that was very true about a lot of the ways we choose to tell stories regarding others, be it gossip or even, sadly, our current lazy entertainment. it's just uncomfortable to look at things in their gray nature, god forbid you relate to someone who has done something you despise.the story follows a mexican fisherman named Kino and his family. his wife juana and his infant son coyotito. their lives are simple in the sense that they have a claim on the very basics of human joy, but nothing more. one day a snake bites his son and they find themselves in need of immediate medical attention but of course the doctor refuses to see them because they are poor. kino feels a sort of anger and humiliation dwell within him and decides to go diving in hopes of finding a big bough pearl to pay the doctor. and sure enough, he finds it. the most beautiful pearl, a Pear Of The World. and immediately he is overwhelmed by all the opportunities this could bring him, his son can learn to read and would not be constantly fooled by buyers and sellers and doctors because he cannot read the books or signs and has to take their word for it. naturally though, all sorts of forces begin to swell up against kino and his will.This book is a bitter beautiful retelling of a time old tale of trying to get our of the gutters and having everyone on top and in the bottom sit on you simultaneously. it's about how dreams, once settling, could rewrite your whole genetic coding, could drive you mad, and could really break you.Steinbeck is amazing for many reasons, but mostly, I think, for two: his always writing about the way of those in the bottom of the food chain, always portraying them as the intelligent, oppressed and admirable human beings they really are. and his style, his accessible, beautiful poetic naked choice of words that gives a very lucid clear image of what exactly is going on.I fucking loved this.

221,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43931803-renuka,Rating 4 out of 5,"“Luck, you see, brings bitter friends.” The pearl is a simple story filled with symbolism and hidden messages (money brings evil, people are not always what they seem, ignorance leads to repression, and many more). “In the town they tell the story of the great pearl” how it was found and how it was lost again. They tell of Kino, the fisherman, and of his wife, Juana, and of the baby, Coyotito. And because the story has been told so often, it has taken root in every man’s mind. And, as with all retold tales that are in people’s hearts, there are only good and bad things and black and white things and good and evil things and no in-between anywhere.“If this story is a parable, perhaps everyone takes his own meaning from it and reads his own life into it. In any case, they say in the town that…”Like all other Steinbeck's books, it has the main characters who are not rich but are poor (fishermen). Steinbeck here stresses on music as an important part of people of the village. Music is very important for Kino, it gives him strength and warns him of danger.I loved the story, it is written in a very simple language but it is actually very complex. Beautiful at the same time heartbreaking too. This is my second Steinbeck's book and I am already a big fan of his writing."

This book has no lesson besides ""killing a boat is wrong"" and ""always throw away valuable things that you find"" I only read this book because I was forced to and I strongly disliked it. Kino accomplished nothing and should go rethink his life choices. In the book Stienbeck calls it evil to kill a boat yet it is ok to kill 4 people and beat your wife for trying to steal the pearl that you will eventually throw away. The moral that I am teaching you is... That if you find a valuable pearl, don't waste the money on this book. It is $9.00 and 3 hours of your life that you never get back. I would reccomend this book to: people who like books that are complete trash"

231,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71312811-jake,Rating 5 out of 5," Of course, as Steinbeck said, people will have different interpretations of this tale, that sometimes seems even mythical, the following will be my interpretations.  The pearl came from the bottom of the ocean, as the pearl diver Kino sought into the absolute darkness, he found the pearl that seduces the greed of men. The pearl saw the light of day and submerged the world into endless darkness of the sea floor. Where monsters lay, where no one sees one another, just smelling around for prey. How interesting that the prey that after the human world was submerged undersea was the pearl. It was not edible food that the animals sought for. Humans feed on vanity and greed. They saw into the pearl, a long, hard look. Saw their desires, some that one imagines to accomplish on a daily basis, also the desire of the monster inside that kept growing. The fetus state of this devil started in the adult world of lies and evil, which brought more evil, and this pearl brought out exactly that. Though it is easy to confuse this idea with the idea that the pearl was never the one that created evil. The evilness was suppressed in the hearts of people, restrained by the chains of societal morality. However, as the pearl emerges, it turned more personal. It made people selfish, and forget about such rules to protect their own desires.  In the book Sapiens, it pointed out that in the early stages of human society, people were in a tight community, where everything was based on credit, but as governments and Capitalism emerges, the government wants the people to depend on them more, which caused the downfall of community and turned into ""if we want the best for ourselves it will also be good for others"". This isolation was presented when the doctor was introduced. Isolated big mansion compared to the clustered brush houses of satisfied fisher families. The doctor was never satisfied, gets lazier and lazier, morals more and more corrupt. Lives are quantifiable in currencies. Also, the doctor who was described very much as a pig was also eating bacon, which means that in this metaphor, the act of the doctor eating the bacon is in fact cannibalism. Eating of one's own species. The lack of bond, the lack of history, everything is the forever now. Everything could be betrayed, nothing stays. On the other hand, as the pearl works its way into the lives of Kino and his family and the community, the same was presented. An isolation and corruption of morals. Everything became everyone for themselves for desires isolates. Kino killed in the dark, for darkness was all there was, in the deep, deep ocean floor that the pearl brought. He didn't care for the dead man's face, on the one hand, he was scared, on the other hand, he didn't care. It didn't matter to him whether the man was anybody, it was just ""the man who's going to take away my pearl"".  Another very interesting idea for me was the idea of a man being half God and half insane. The reason why one can never become God is that of the human nature of insanity within them. Of course, I'm not saying that without human nature we can be God, but I'm talking about why we can't reach this level of the maximum level of morality which God has. The insane always trumps the half God version of men. Another way of seeing was expressed in the metaphor about the trap and the ants in the beginning and the one towards the end. The first one he saw the trap in a God perspective but did nothing. He saw evil, but what God would do would to stop it. Instead, the animal inside Kino recognized the logic of these animals and let them be, this displayed the half-insane side. The second metaphor was which he created the evil and the men that he once looked down on overcoming it. Now showing his half God side.  I suppose even without the pearl, this kind of utopia would eventually be broken for all utopias are just dystopias in disguise, at least for us humans. The animals seemed to be brought from the sea and possessed themselves onto men, but this pearl, as Steinbeck wrote, was an illusion. People tried to blame the pearl, but it was nothing but the animals inside men that try to find an understanding of such horror that they committed and convincing the good inside men that it was not their fault. At a certain point, the moral side of humanity weakens and would be put away, and something ancient would be released. No matter how people tried to convince themselves that this monster they turned into was still the moral man, it was nothing but a masked appearance.  Nobody fooled anybody. Evil was evil. Man was man.  The truly moral person inside Juana which was still very much there, was pushed away by Kino's monster. And because of the gender system, it was never overthrown.  At times of evil, people tried to find evil in others to blame, but it was nothing but a net of evil that if one looks far enough, would eventually trace back to oneself.  This book is on the colonialism of evil, I suppose. After the pearl returns and submerges into the deepest part of sea, it travels once again, erodes, and somewhere forms back together again. Perhaps into something else next time. Until the colony of evil will spread to all the oases of men. Not because the pearl itself is evil, but because it makes the blind see. Peels away the masks of utopia. This was never quite a myth. But I suppose the monsters who see too much truth tells the moral self to dismiss it as myth, but once the pearl finds us, we'll know how true it will be. "
232,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42098789-eve-kay,Rating 4 out of 5,"I think Steinbeck writes well and most of The Pearl is above bar. Not an easy task to get all your descriptions, settings and especially the mood into such a short story. It does get a bit boring in the middle, which I think reflects more on the decision to have a big plot twist coming so there needs to be a heightened difference in moods.I think I studied this more than I actually read it and thought it was excellent. There are some beautiful descriptions in the beginning of what songs mean to other cultures and what beauty is. There is a lot of beauty in all that is before the pearl which we could all learn something from."

I've not touched it since. Even when I was supposed to write an essay about ""greed"" in The Pearl in grade ten, I couldn't bring myself to open the pages.Brontë, my ten year old daughter, just finished it, however, and I felt compelled to read it again, mostly because I saw her getting depressed (well ... maybe more angry than sad), so I wanted to be able to talk intelligently with her about what she'd read. It effected her much the way it had me, but this time around I discovered I wasn't depressed at all, merely resigned. Age'll do stuff like that to you (though I make no claim to maturity), I suppose. I've heard and read plenty about the role of greed in the book and its central thematic presence, particularly its corrupting influence on Kino -- and that was all of great interest to Brontë -- but of far more interest to me this time around was the Marxist take on race relations embedded in Steinbeck's work, and they are ugly. The institutionalized racism of class and economics is writ large in The Pearl, and if Juana's final act is any way to gauge Steinbeck's hopes for the future they were nil.O! your prophetic soul, John. You Pearl is not enough to depress me any more, but only because I have developed a carapice to help fend off the utter futility of it all. Where are those doing what you did today, huh? Nowhere to be seen in the literary world at large. So where are they? Toiling in the obscurity of self-publication or silence, no doubt. "

I found this one sweet enough to be suspect though. It has that sad whimsy that says John Steinbeck to me and it's a fast read that's probably good for you. In some ways the pearl that Kino finds reminded me of Frodo's ring. Even down to the fugitives hiding from a dark rider!Mexico has had a sad history and not all of that sorrow has yet been exorcised. This story gives a flavor of that. It's by turns fanciful and touching, sad and heartwarming. Yet, it's not a happy tale and the morose quality that permeates these poverty-stricken lives must make this an unappealing read for many that are forced to read it.I see that this book is on the listopia list ""Read These In School - Would Have Preferred A Root Canal"" personally, I disagree. This book is not painful as much as mildly depressing, and at only 82 pages, reading it was probably quicker than my last root canal.If nothing else, this book reminded me that I need to read The Milagro Beanfield War.

239,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68295640-zak,Rating 4 out of 5,"Superb. The setting of this moving tale could be anywhere in the world today and it's message would still be relevant. Sometimes, people think that those who are destitute or 'down on their luck' are in such situations due to their own apathy or laziness or stupidity; and if they would only 'pull up their socks' then surely their lot would improve. However, oftentimes we forget that circumstances such as lack of opportunity or education and society itself work together to pull the the less fortunate down no matter how hard they try to escape the clutches of poverty. Add in superstitious beliefs and misguided counsel from self-righteous clergy and the struggle is almost over even before it's begun.This novella is a stark reminder of the importance of arming ourselves (and if not possible, at least our children) with knowledge and to learn 'the ways of the world' so that we may not be easily exploited. On the flip side, it is also imperative that we examine our own hypocrisies lest we be guilty ourselves of exploiting the ignorance or trust of others. I can imagine some fancy advisors 'tut-tutting' the actions of the pearl buyers in the story, while loading up their client's portfolios with toxic bonds and CDO's just for the fat commissions."

This short story follows a pearl diver named Kino, his wife, and their infant son Coyotito. They have a family medical emergency early in the book, and then Kino lucks out and finds ""the pearl of the world"" which should solve all of their financial problems. It turns out that going instantly from rags riches may not be all it's cracked up to be. I would recommend this to any normal/regular person who wins the lottery because there is a good story here about maintaining focus on things that are truly important in life. I have seen stories of folks that have won the lottery and it ruined their life so it can happen. This book got a little bit slow in parts so I knocked off 2 stars for that. Steinbeck is truly unmatched in his development of his settings though. His worlds always feel real to me. I liked The Pearl overall, but I believe that East of Eden and Of Mice and Men, (both of which I read last year), are vastly superior to this. "

How many words are necessary in order to create a fully fleshed story? I don't know. I honestly didn't expect much. But what I found was extraordinary. ""The Pearl"" is almost a fable, a story of greed and corruption, riches and all the possibilities that riches can offer you. It is told in a simple manner, but the complexity of it is real. Steinbeck touches upon topics such as the importance of education, and the breaking of a vicious circle created by power and uncertainty. Steinbeck's small eco system is destroyed by a glimmering pearl; by a man who dares to hope to become something more than the society he is a product of. This is the best 80 pages I have ever read. "

Hay todo otro aspecto social que presiona a Kino y está bien retratado por Steinbeck. Es como si el realismo decimonónico se cruzara con Hemingway. Si al final, como dice Steinbeck en el prólogo, la historia no es sino una parabola, el lector, en última instancia, verá reflejada en la novela su propia vida y con ello su propia interpretación."

Here, the fateful account of Kino, an impoverished pearl diver, his wife Juana, and their infant son Coyotito, is a moving parable that illustrates the importance of social structures—family, village, and town—in the lives of individuals as sources of knowledge, strength, and inspiration, contrasted with the corrupting influence of wealth."

I really hope that material belongings will bring joy to everyone who are ignorant enough to pursue them, because sure as hell they will regret about it in the near future.I would like to mention that before writing anything about a book that I have just read, I have this habit of reading other people's reviews. Many mentioned that Steinbeck was, in fact, a sexist. How on Earth do you even come to such conclusion, if I may ask?John Steinbeck lived in the first half of the 20th century, a time when the roles of women and men were, in a way... more defined(?) So, *both* Kino's and Juana's actions in this book are based on the social norms of the time.Such comments lead me to believe that those people have not read this book at all. Because right from the very first chapter in this book it is obvious that Juana, as a woman, is presented as a pillar of the family, and someone who is ready to do everything that it takes in order to save her ill child. There is no such power in this world that can stop a mother from helping her own child. (I at least want to believe in this) Furthermore, she is the only one standing in the way and opposes her husband Kino not to be completely swallowed up by greed.And one more thing, read Of Mice and Man by this very same author. You will find a bunch of trash man, who in real life would have had sexist attitude. And since they are portrayed as nothing but trash (as they should) by J. Steinbeck, I think that he does not deserve to be called that name. Don't tar everybody with the same brush."

I was wondering why. For me, I wanted to give it 5 stars. First of all, since it is a novella, I was not expecting something unnecessary puddings to make it Pulitzer-prize winning. The story is neat and organized- suitable to John Steinback’s goal, enough to give a moral lesson that materialism brings about EVIL. I learned that he had a hard time finishing it, which is normal among writers. It could have been as great a novel as his other works. Nevertheless, he paid off. ^^It reminded me of its excerpt we studied in high school literature. Alas, I did not take it seriously. Neverthess, its caricature, of a man holding the pearl up in the sky while floating in the sea is still marked in my memory.It is subject to different interpretations because of the symbols Steinbeck used such as the Song of the Family, the Song of the Evil, The Pearl, and so on.What gave me an impact was when the jewelry dealers examine the pearl whether it is valuable or not. It is up to you if you think the three jewelry dealers cheat on Kino, the protagonist. But their opinions might dwell upon your mind, for they have something to do with what the PEARL as the symbol of materialism is all about.For me, since I read John Steinbeck’s biography in Wikipedia, the crux of this novella is that CAPITALISM is the root of evil. Do you think so? ^^If I read his immortal novels The Grape of Wrath and Of Mice and Men, would I regret having given it 5 stars? If I had read them, in comparison, I would say they were better than this one. Since I haven’t read them yet, it is just my first reaction to this novella - amazing! ^^"

264,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2580971-smiley,Rating 3 out of 5,"I think reading this 87-page novel is worth spending our time since John Steinbeck has written superbly in his own narrative style (I'd read his ""Of Mice and Men"" and ""Travels with Charley in Search of America"" before) and surprisingly inspiring dialogues. We thus can't help admiring his words, phrases, sentences, etc. used appropriately in the contexts, for instance:1)""The doctor has gone out,"" he said. ""He was called to a serious case."" And he shut the gate quickly out of shame. And now a wave of shame went over the whole procession. They melted away. The beggars went back to the church steps, the stragglers moved off, and the neighbors departed so that the public shaming of Kino would not be in their eyes. (p. 13)2)The news came to the doctor where he sat with a woman whose illness was age, though neither she nor the doctor would admit it. (p. 21)3)But Kino had lost his old world and he must clamber on to a new one. For his dream of the future was real and never to be destroyed, and he had said, ""I will go,"" and that made a real thing too. To determine to go and to say it was to be halfway there. (p. 52)etc.Steinbeck has long been one of my admirable writers whose writings I would like to imitate, literally, and adapt as my own. "

Would it bring you happiness? Would it make your life better? That is the crux of The Pearl. It has one of the best prefaces I have ever encountered:
""In the town they tell the story of the great pearl - how it was found and how it was lost again. They tell of Kino, the fisherman, and of his wife, Juana, and of the baby, Coyotito. And because the story has been told so often, it has taken root in every man’s mind. And, as with all retold tales that are in people’s hearts, there are only good and bad things and black and white things and good and evil things and no in between anywhere.If this story is a parable, perhaps everyone takes his own meaning from it and reads his own life into it. In any case, they say in the town that…""
The story and its setting reminded me of the Philippines, where I lived for almost three years. Perhaps that was why it felt close; and, in part, why Steinbeck's preface was so powerful. "
267,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5172572-lemar,Rating 4 out of 5,"Be careful what you wish for you just might get it. Steinbeck seems to be saying that it is easier to imagine a better life than it is to appreciate the life we have. On another level he is us into the perspective of a First Nations man negotiating the decision of whether or not to have his family adopt the dress and education of the colonial power. To this day this point of view is rare and fraught with the danger of appearing condescending or inauthentic. Steinbeck avoids both of these traps his rendering Kino and his wife Juana. They come off as a highly intelligent couple aware of the dangers and limits imposed on anyone trying to improve their social and economic status in colonial Mexico. Steinbeck once again succeeds, as in the Grapes of Wrath, in creating an indelible bond between the reader and a character whose path to the dream of fulfillment is blocked by unfair societal power structures. This is s bitter pill to swallow and Steinbeck is unsparing in bringing this reality into the light. "

And this is said in disparagement, whereas it is one of the greatest talents the species has and one that has made it superior to animals that are satisfied with what they have.”This would be my second book of Steinbeck after Of Mice and Men. Steinbeck's tragic miseries are lessons of life. Men with their greed tend to destroy the simple serene life of theirs and turn them into utter disaster. Steinbeck's understanding of human emotions is outstanding. The pearl perfectly captures the vices of greed and envy in human nature.There's nothing wrong in having big dreams but how much you are willing to pay for achieving them is the precarious thing.

 this book! I am pretty certain that I read it back in middle school, but I just picked it back up to read to students as a read aloud. The themes of greed and love and family and desire .. and, and .. there really was so much packed into this little text. Did Kino have a right to desire the pearl and the better life that it offered his family? Was it he that drastically altered the course of his family and his life? Was he forever doomed before and after the pearl emerged? There is just so much.This Mexican folktale pulls at your heart; makes you think; imbeds the song of compassion, evil, and protection into your head and heart. The jealousy and greed of human nature is a sad and scary thing and Steinbeck captures that message beautifully. Just so much love."

Adoré el concepto de ""la canción de la familia"" que constantemente suena en la cabeza del protagonista para decirnos que el conocimiento y la esencia de sus antepasados lo acompañan y lo guían. Steinbeck tiene un narración muy ordenada y metódica. Nos explica detalles que a simple vista parecen nimios, pero tienden a ser impactantes por la forma en cómo las cuenta. Desde el cantar de los grillos hasta el brillo en los ojos de Juana.Experimentamos el sentimiento de comunidad. Cómo un grupo de personas se mueven para ayudar a alguien cercano, pero también cómo la maquinaria avanza para causarle un perjuicio. Vemos sueños y esperanzas puestos en un objeto pequeño.

His voice is like pure gruff butter. I do want to address its low rating on Goodreads. I think a lot of people read this in high school or even middle school due to the lack of language or sexuality.

Parece un argumento simple pero Steinbeck retrata una sociedad de ricos y pobres, de buenos y malos en un contexto histórico concreto relacionado con el indigenismo y el colonialismo y, por lo tanto, se trata de una sociedad dividida en castas. Kino es un trabajador pobre e indígena.Desde ahí parte todo el relato, por eso, cuando Kino encuentra la perla la inocencia se convierte en ambición, y se nota también cómo reacciona la gente ante la buena fortuna de otro hombre. Podría decirse que el tema principal de esta novela corta, de escritura sencilla y clara es la codicia. Además, puede hablar de la humanidad y su actuación de forma general: ¿Qué haríamos de encontrar una perla avaluada en muchísimo dinero? ¿Qué pasaría con nuestro entorno?Como dato curioso está inspirado en un cuento mexicano y ambientado en Baja California."

E como da vez anterior, tocou-me profundamento o casal de pescadores, Kino e Juana.Quis passar pela experiência novamente, mas alargar-se muito sobre o livro é correr o risco de entregar muito da história narrada por John Steinbeck, que usa das parábolas envoltas nessa história para nos contar sobre ""a necessidade"" e ""a ganância"", que parecem vizinhas, mas são o oposto uma da outra. Steinbeck é sempre pungente em seus livros, mas não poderia ser diferente, pois escolheu tratar daqueles que em geral são relegados ao rodapé da história (e quando o são), as populações pobres que em geral se encontram sob o jugo daqueles que detêm o poder, os quais só olham para o lado quando algo lhes interessa. Geralmente dominados pela ganância, pela vontade de exploração para ganho próprio. Em A Pérola, alguém tem de pagar um preço altíssimo pela ganância dos homens.É significativo também que quando seus vizinhos perguntam a Kino o que pretende fazer com a pérola encontrada, tem uma resposta certeira: enviar o filho, Coyotito, à escola para poder aprender a ler e a decifrar as palavras, algo que nenhum deles sabe fazer.

290,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18759897-lee,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Pearl is a Mexican fable persuasively re-told by American author John Steinbeck. There is a moral in this simple tale, which is told in cold, simple text and paints nature and difficult human choices in very stark terms.Setting. The Mexican-Indian village of La Paz, a coastal fishing village is described with realism. Set in a subtropical desert scrub, its arid, harsh nature is a fitting backdrop to the poor Mexican family and their daily fight for survival.Symbols. An early symbol in The Pearl is the scorpion. If like me you have experienced its ghastly, venomous sting, you know the cold fear that sweeps over you when you encounter a scorpion in a dark place like your closet or on your bedding. Anyone who lives in the arid Southwest US or in Texas will have encountered the frightening almost jaundiced yellow curling tail. A sting from its lightening fast arched tail is excruciating and can be fatal to a small child or mammal.The Pearl. ""The Pearl of the World, perfect as the Moon"" will carry the reader into the luminescent realm of the fable. The symbolism of this magnificent pearl will thrust the characters into an other-worldly experience of unforgettable drama and tragedy.Moral. I will not tread on John Steinbeck's masterful treatment of this fable by inserting my own moral interpretations of a classic novel.

As it is horribly corny, I won’t. Good Lord! Where did ""corny"" pop up from? - a flashback to childhood.) In his introduction, Steinbeck suggests that it may be read as a parable. I found it very difficult not to read it as a kind of photographic negative of Matthew 13:45. Kino, having found his pearl of great price, sacrifices all he has for it. What he “gains” however, is no kingdom of heaven, only an insight into the greed, selfishness and evil that the pearl reflects throughout the various layers of his world, including that within himself. The pearl is not the cause of these, only the trigger that forces them powerfully to the surface. It is “… the pearl of the world”, the image of a world dominated by an unrestrained and ill-directed desire for gain and profit. It seems a perfect parable for our own times.The story begins with images of a simple way of life in a relatively primitive village community, with its own traditions, ways and rhythms. It has some seemingly idyllic qualities, but Steinbeck does not pretend that it is some earthly paradise. He shows rather its limitations, its folly, its fickleness, and it’s vulnerability to outside forces both natural and man-made. However, it does also give a powerful sense of a shared identity to its inhabitants, reflected in the inner songs of the village and the family heard by Kino. The device of the changing song he hears within himself, ranging from all that is best in his community and its traditions, to the songs of evil, greed and death is very powerful indeed. There is a danger in interpreting parable, of reducing it to simple, allegorical equivalences. This leads to gross underestimate of the power of the form; (not least in the simplistic interpretations of New Testament parables that are often dished out). Steinbeck use of symbol and metaphor in this story is very rich and powerful, going far beyond any x = y type interpretation. Steinbeck’s narrative style is so well crafted. He produces some wonderfully tense and suspenseful scenes - the attack on Kino’s home by those seeking to steal the pearl, the pursuit by, and deaths of, the trackers, and also of the baby.This is only the second piece of Steinbeck’s that I've read, the other being “Of Mice and Men”.

Nonetheless, here I am reading it all these years later. This isn't Steinbeck's best work, but surely one among many that he is known for. Except for one chapter read last night, I finished the entire book in one day. It is a very enjoyable book whose storyline is easy to follow. This book closely mirrors the works of Hemingway in its morbid tragedy as greed results in destruction and death. One family's hope in their treasured find to help them transcend the generational life of poverty, is another person's lustful covetousness of that very same prize. Seemingly, nothing but wanton destruction and senseless death can result. This book would make a great introduction into the works of John Steinbeck. Please read!"

Aquí los pobres son buenos y los ricos son abusivos, y esto se anuncia desde la primera página: “Como en todos los relatos eternos que viven en los corazones del pueblo, sólo hay cosas buenas y malas, blancas y negras, santas y perversas, sin que se hallen jamás medias tintas”.

Didn't read in high school.I will go ahead and rate this a perfect book. I think it will stay with me for a long time. This is so deep.I was instantly hooked with the imagery and the painting of the picture of the morning of a young but poor family awakening in La Paz. This is dripping in imagery and symbolism throughout.Irony is also strong here. Kino contemplates the fear he has as an ""Indigene"" toward the white men. When the pearl is found his greatest hope for his beloved son is that he will go to school, learn to read, and learn the secrets of white colonizers (portrayed as routinely exploiting, tricking, and cheating his people -- a totally accurate picture of our history). Yet his son would ultimately join the ranks or the class of these people (In Canada, education and schools were used explicitly in a government stated and outlined plan for committing genocide against the First Nations who lived here, ""Kill the 'Indian' but save the child"".) Leaving us with the question of whether this is an admirable goal. Yet, throughout, religious dogma is cited encouraging people to know their place and discouraging them from rising above their station in life. For me, this IS part of the scam; therefore, I am naturally cheering for the course of striking it rich and educating his son. And... this is also obviously part of my white, colonizer, Capitalist-baby bias (an undeniable part of my identity).The book warns its readers that they will view this simple folk tale in black and white terms, (good vs evil, colonizers vs First Nations, rich vs poor, leavers vs takers) and the book's prediction was accurate. Yet, the complication is that I cannot form a conclusion for this folk tale's moral question or lesson. I am conflicted. This is why this book will leave a deep mark on my memory.The action is fast-paced and knowing it is a folk tale creates a lot of suspense as readers will be searching for the meaning until the end.Although this book is very deep and simple and complex at once -- I do think it was an appropriate selection for my grade-9 English class. At times, I am shocked in hindsight at the inappropriateness of some of the books that were chosen for our age level; however, this is an excellent book for grade-9 and the introduction of literature."

It was assigned for language arts class, so what was there to like about it? And yet, I loved it. The story was captivating; a story of a man's battle within himself to cease the greed and hunger that was overpowering him. The story seemed so real to me, despite the setting of the story and the background of the characters being immensely different from mine. Kino, the main character in this short novel, was a person I both hated and loved. His determination for the good of his family was indomitable. I admired the times where he fought for the right of his people, showed the fatherly and caring side of him for Coyotito, and comforted Juana with love and power. But at the same time, I hated him. I hated him for succumbing to the greed and hunger that came with the pearl, for being so blind to the suffering of his family, and most of all, I hated him for beating Juana. Juana was such a lovable character: her never-ending forgiveness for Kino, her motherly love for Coyotito, and just the strength she withheld that wasn't expected from women. I greatly enjoyed following these full of life characters through their journey, but it was the last few paragraphs of the story that carried it to five stars. I am an absolute fan of sad endings, and Steinbeck wrote one of the most touching ones I have ever read. ""The people say that the two seemed to be removed from human experience; that they had gone through pain and had come out on the other side; that there was almost a magical protection about them. And those people who had rushed to see them crowded back and let them pass and did not speak to them... He looked into its surface and it was gray and ulcerous. Evil faces peered from it into his eyes, and he saw the light of burning. And in the surface of the pearl he saw the frantic eyes of the man in the pool. And in the surface of the pearl he saw Coyotito lying in the little cave with the top of his head shot away. And the pearl was ugly; it was gray, like a malignant growth. And Kino heard the music of the pearl, distorted and insane."" -Chapter 6, The Pearl.The ending was both heartbreaking and breathtaking. Kino and Juana's hearts have been broken, and it almost seems like their souls have died as well. And this is what it took for Kino to be shook back into reality and sanity. It took the death of his own son, and the sacrifice of both their happiness in the future, for him to learn the lesson. Great things come with deadly consequences. I loved this story; it portrayed the reality that tragedy does strike, even to the most wonderful people."

The way that the Steinbeck wrote the book was very well done, but for me it was too boring. I like fast paced action books and this book was too slow for me. However I thought that this book had a lot of emotions to it and that Steinbeck used those emotions to create the whole story. Steinbeck also used iceberg theory really well, because for each sentence you had to dig deep to get the real meaning of what Steinbeck is saying. I do not think that Steinbeck should have made Kino throw away the pearl, because Kino went through so much pain and then in the end he got nothing out of it. All in all I would not read this book again because it was too slow for me. "
