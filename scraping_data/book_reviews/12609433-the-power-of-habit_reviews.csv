0,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1381799-sleeps9hours,Rating 2 out of 5,"I just read Kelly McGonigal's ""The Willpower Instinct"", so I can't help but compare the two.Duhigg is an investigative reporter for the NY Times, while McGonigal is a research psychologist, and the differences come across in the writing. McGonigal has a much better grasp on the research and how to apply it, while Duhigg brings in stories that are entertaining but stretch his powers of interpretation. His most annoying stylistic problem is that he breaks his stories up, stopping one to start another and then coming back to it later. I assume he's trying to add a sense of anticipation and drama to what should otherwise be a straightforward nonfiction book, but I found it frustrating for him to be jumping back and forth for no good reason.I did enjoy many of his stories though. The most interesting was in the section about social habits where he explains why the arrest of Rosa Parks was so influential while other black women at the same time had also refused to give up their seats but didn't spark much interest (Parks had social ties across dozens of groups, black and white, and knew some people of influence). The entire story of how Martin Luther King, Jr. became involved, and all the people who got the bus boycott rolling is so fascinating to hear in detail. "
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/373260-k,Rating 3 out of 5,"Read this because of fascinating NYT magazine excerpt on how Target tracks our buying habits. The rest of the book is not as compelling -- anecdotes sometimes don't support particular arguments he's attempting to illustrate (the Hey-Ya examples being the most egregious), and his section on how social movements occur is weak and unconvincing, and not really about habits, per se. Style and structure were often clunky, and the book seems a bit muddled as its ultimate purpose. I dunno, I guess I was expecting slightly more substantial psychology or social science and instead got more of a book solidly for businesses/manager types and people on the beginning of their self-help journeys. But I fall into the latter category, so why am I pooh pooh-ing this book so much? I dunno. Maybe I am just jealous of how $$$ money this dude's gonna make at corporate speaking gigs. Anyway, lessons I'll take away -- *making your bed every morning and committing to regular exercise are two habits that can transform your entire goddamn life*Diagram about mouse brain activity spike post-reward eventually arriving prior to reward (the origin of cravings)*Changing habits requires identifying the cues and rewards that trigger and support the habit behavior, then trying out various substitutes for the behavior that might achieve the same reward*deliberate advance plans for responding to challenging situations can be extremely helpful (ex Scottish knee/hip replacement patients, Michael Phelps, Starbucks)*With more challenging habits like alcoholism or stuff related to football, true belief and submission to some higher purpose is necessary*in general, it's more effective to change others' habits if you make them believe they have some power or authority over their decision than if you coerce them with force *casinos are super evil"
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12827408-robert-chapman,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is great book, and you need to read it. How is that for a definitive opening line? The reason it’s such a good book is because it uses research to explain how habits are formed and changed. Everyone knows someone who was out of shape, or was a smoker, and then in what appeared as if almost overnight, changed themselves in a short period of time. How did they do that? They formed new habits and changed old ones, that’s how.Do something enough and it becomes a habit, good or bad. This is explained in the book by research on memory loss. For example, the research found that patients suffering from memory loss could not show someone where the kitchen is when asked, but once they got hungry the would get up and go to the kitchen automatically.This is made possible by the habit loop of cue, routine, and reward. The cue makes the brain find the routine as it anticipates the reward. A classic example is stress and smoking, the cue is stress, the routine is smoking, the reward is the feeling the cigarette brings.I was most interested in how the book described changing a habit. Let’s face it, we all have habits we want to change. To accomplish this we need to keep the cue and reward, but change the routine. I’ll use an example from my own life to illustrate. I love chocolate, and to make it worse I love to eat at it night. Well I love to eat at night because that is how I formed the habit some time ago. I used the guidance from this book to change that habit. I kept the cue and reward, but I changed the routine to use apples instead of chocolate.This logic flows into much larger problem sets such as organizations and communities. Focus on changing one thing, the keystone habit from which a cascade of other habits will form. The author illustrates this example by discussing how the company Alcoa was transformed by the keystone habit of a singular focus on safety.The book flows really well and uses research throughout to substantiate the concepts presented. The audience who can benefit from this book is vast, from individuals to corporates to governments."
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,Rating 2 out of 5,"I was looking forward to a substantial, science and evidence based, compelling read, but just found many mixed up ego and self finding trips, business manager motivation yada, and some good points accidentally mixed in. Read Clear James` Atomic habits instead, it´s much better. What is really strange is that the chapters seem to follow a logical approach, if one orients her/himself as always first by the titles of the index, and it looks like they are dealing with the meta or concrete context, but are in reality just anecdotes, except of some technobabble about Target´s use of pattern recognition, AI, and behavioral science; I mean, why? Was it too difficult to pimp the already written material with the help of some experts to combine both nonfiction and autobiographical elements instead of this? It seems as if many people are getting their swift kick out of procrastination by material available in any newspaper column, youtube guru channel, or whatever, but I just don´t get the hype around it. Worst of it, with this social science mixup and freely interpretation of the stories in a highly subjective style he is entering the realm of, don´t be scared or stop reading and forget liking my review, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replica...You see, it´s sweet if some unique people with subjective mindsets and different characters deal with difficult situations in a positive way, but I don´t get the picture of how Duhigg can extrapolate this to universal ideas as if he would have used real scientific evidence of, let´s say, long term studies going over decades with millions of participants, or brain chemistry, neurology, or anything substantial instead of person XY had results YZ. This has absolutely no worth for the reader. There are a handful of useful tips one can take away, most of them available in shorter, better, free, and easier form available in many wikis (see end of the review) if one just searches for motivation, positive psychology, meditation, self reflection, behavior, etc. that don´t just repeat commonplaces. How he is trying to deal with addiction is pop psychology at it´s worst and that the book doesn´t really offer solutions, plans, or at least good sources for more research is the kicker, as it´s what the title and marketing are implying and promising. It´s not totally bad, but very, very overhyped and the sad thing is that people mind find it great to read this motivating stories, but without a concrete plan to self development and improvement, the motivation fades away as quickly as the memory of the redundant, convertible tiny tales. Oh, did I mention that reading the book has the lovely extra element of being belittled by a condescending, narcissistic writing style? A completely failed approach that depreciates the few, good elements in it and insults the reader. Ok, one more, it stigmatizes the victims of gambling, addictions, or shopaholics instead of just moving a centimeter (review written in Europe, sorry) towards asking why such unregulated industries can easily hunt down already weakened human game. Shame on you, gambler! Evil shopaholic! How dare you having an alcohol problem! That´s a wise, mature, and productive way of dealing with serious topics. Without this, I would have given 3 stars, but including own, restricted bias and agenda disguised as facts downed it to 2. Funny, just now that I am thinking about it, how each hard earned everyman bill has to be tracked down and taxed, while letting people lose everything within hours, the reasons for addictions, or brainwashing for consumerism is absolutely no problem and Duhigg is completely ignoring the structures producing the problems because he is so busy with victim blaming and shaming. Other authors stay objective or avoid such topics instead of superficially dealing with it to boost sales. I am pretty sure that some of the concepts and ideas won´t stand the test of time, as real science, medicine, and screening technology improve, and as they appear like very soft humanities stuff. A final subjective list of elements a good nonfiction book should at least have, that are quite missing in this one:A detailed plan how to DIY.Own theories that are defined as subjective opinions in the case of humanities or, and in natural sciences, proofed by many hard facts.New combinations of existing theories and ideas.Entertaining, very well written anecdotes. There is not much new under the sun and most fictional and nonfiction works are remixes and new interpretations of facts and tropes, but that doesn´t mean that it have to be loveless, average, wrong, and presumptuous concoctions. But thanks for extra training to deal with anger through cognitive techniques and quick meditations, at least it´s good for that.A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real life outside books: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positiv...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivationhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavio...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindful..."
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1242918-rhianna,Rating 2 out of 5," This may be a crappy review since its going up via iPhone. Sorry. First caveat: I work in research. A big part of my job is creating these habit loops and seeing if they can be altered or enhanced via medication. Second caveat: I'm a nerd and love journal articles, scientific writing, and technical reading, even off the job.Third caveat: I only got to chapter eight. I honestly don't know what I was expecting. By far and large, when there's big buzz about a book I inevitably dislike it with very few exceptions. I was hoping for something smart and eye opening; a different, more personal take on habits and addiction (which is really what a habit is if you think about it), and I was let down mostly by the writing and anecdotes. I realize this book isn't intended for scientific review, but when there were so many teasing moments of talking about the research going on, I guess I just expected a little more substance in laymans terms. The biggest problem I had with the book was that I probably could have only read the first few chapters and have a total grasp of the theory. While some stories were interesting, they reminded me of Grandpa Simpson's storytelling. I don't think we needed so many examples that all said the same thing. Think of all the trees that could have been saved if a few were omitted. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad read. People with a non-neuroscience background can enjoy it and will learn something from it. Although how to apply it to your life is pretty much missing from the book (unless it was in the chapters I didn't get to yet). Yeah, find a new reward to break bad habits, but how? It would have been interesting to see those suggestions. Overall, not horrible. Had it not been a book club read I wouldn't have picked it up of my own volition, but I'm not upset that I read most of it. I am upset that I kept reading hoping to get something different in the next chapter, which didn't happen. Just save the time and money and read his NY Times article (at least I think it was there) instead. "
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,Rating 3 out of 5,"I need to start with the obvious – this guy is one of those writers. One of those writers that make you want to track him down and hurt him. And not just him, maybe even his pets too. He assumes you are as thick as dog-shit and that you won’t get what it is he is talking about unless he makes it painfully (PAINFULLY) clear. He has missed his calling. He really should have gone into the self-help book market – let’s face it, assuming your readers are dumb in that market is just ‘responding to reality’. You might be wondering why I gave this book three stars, given I wanted to find ways to hurt the author. Well, the problem is that some of the ideas here are not insane, in fact, some are really well worth thinking about. It’s just that someone (someone who also needs hunted down, now that I think about it) has told this guy you need to ‘tell a story’. And while this is often excellent advice – you also need to remember that people are reading your book for a reason and that reason isn’t to cry over the last moments of a drug addict’s life or to find out how the skunk lady got laid. No, it is to find out about the affect of habits and what we can do to change the habits of a life time that are stuffing up our lives.I’ve been reading lots of Bourdieu lately. He talks of Habitus – what he calls the ‘feel for the game’, but basically the habits we have that are so unconscious we don't even know they are habits and so, therefore, have no idea what a huge part they play in shaping the kinds of people we are. So we tend to think that because we wouldn’t do something someone else clearly has done that automatically qualifies us for the golden stamp of merit. Whereas, so much of what we do in life is either non-rational or automatic – having those automatic structures implanted in us from no age is more a matter of luck than of rational deliberation.This guy stuffs up his argument at the end by not having the conviction of what his view on habits was telling him. He tells a long, long, long story of a woman that lost everything through gambling. Terribly sad and all that. But obviously this book is written in America and so nothing can come between the rights of rich people to take money from poor people. So, the fact that casinos do everything to manipulate you so that you end up with nothing is YOUR fault, not theirs – have you no self control? Have you no free will? I think this guy should read Sam Harris’s new book. Either that or he needs to also argue that it should be ok for drug dealers to offer kids drugs at schools and in the streets – if one is wrong it isn’t at all obvious why the other is right. And if not drugs to kids, then drugs to adults – unless I’m missing something the same argument applies.This book is quite chilling in that it explains – in very long and all too often boring detail, in fact endless bloody detail, just how companies like Target are targeting you and manipulating you to buy and buy and buy. Yet again this is presented as if it was nothing to be concerned about – but I struggled to read it as something I should just shrug and get over. When I first learned about data warehousing it sent a cold shiver down my spine – I have never had ‘Fly Buys’ or any other of those ‘loyalty’ programs that give those arseholes all of my details so they can work out how to better market to people like me. I’m manipulated enough in life without needing to provide billionaires with better weapons to trip me up.The information in this book is very worthwhile. But if you ever needed proof that Gladwell has lots to answer for, this book is Item A on the case for the prosecution. And what the hell is it about American Football? I hope to God it isn’t nearly as uninteresting to watch as it is to read about. No wonder Americans invade countries at the drop of a hat – anything to get away from two down on the thirty-first yard line with a wingback on a hiding to nowhere blah, blah AHHHHH!!!! "

Vineet Shaw? Let us discuss Baker.Thomas Baker was an average joe, but not without ambitions. A few years ago, acting on a tip, Tom, a competitive enough guy, decided to take his life into his own hands. What’s more, he decided to pick up one more Self-help book and this time follow up thoroughly on it. No holds barred. He asked around, looked in that wonderful site and finally decided on what seemed to him like the best out there right now. The ratings seemed to be out of the world too. The author, in the intro, even tries to reassure him against feeling overwhelmed by the excess of research in the book. This is exactly the sort of help that Tom needed. Tom read the book with great diligence. He made notes and he made placards and he even bought magnets for his fridge and special sticky tapes for his mirrors. He knew this could work. He only had to believe.He changed his routines, identified and included habit-forming cues. He created them, he played around with them, he even had some fun. He was very inventive and imaginative. The author would have commended the effort if he knew. Tom decide that he would write to Duhigg about his success once it pays off. A month passed. Tom had made slight improvements but no major pay-off seemed to be in the offing. He chided himself for expecting windfalls. He reminded himself that these things take time. He kept at it.6 months now. Even the minor gains he had made originally have fallen by the wayside now. He had read the book thrice in this time, trying to reaffirm his faith. He was discouraged now but he kept at it.2 years. The book is long forgotten. But Tom had taken the trouble to document his experiences and had sent a detailed case study to the author. He had requested that it be included in the next edition of the book. He wanted the author to include a chapter on failures - on how it might not work for everyone. He wanted a caveat, a mild statement of warning that just because a book worth of case studies of success is presented, there is no reason to expect that any approach (no matter how good) might work for everyone. Humans would be fulfilling Asimovesque dreams if that were the case. He thought this would add depth and realism to an otherwise fine book.He did not even get an auto-generated acknowledgment slip. But that was ok, he had discovered a new Gladwell book on another airport aisle. Apparently, it is not just habits that doesn’t stick, lessons don’t either. "

The Habit loop is a neurological pattern that governs any habit. It consists of three elements: a cue, a routine, and a reward. Understanding these components can help in understanding how to change bad habits or form good ones. The habit loop is always started with a cue, a trigger that transfers the brain into a mode that automatically determines which habit to use. The heart of the habit is a mental, emotional, or physical routine. عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «نقش و قدرت عادت‌ها در زندگی»؛ «نیروی عادت: علت آنچه در زندگی و کارمان انجام می‌دهیم چیست؟»؛ «قدرت عادت»؛ «قدرت عادت : چرا ما در زندگی و کار اینگونه عمل می‌کنیم؟»؛ «قدرت عادت: علت کارهای که در کسب‌وکار و زندگی انجام می‌دهیم»؛ «قدرت عادت: دلیل هر آن چه در زندگی و کسب و کار انجام می‌دهیم»؛ «قدرت عادت: چرایی کارهایی که انجام می‌دهیم و چگونگی تغییر دادن آن‌ها»؛ «قدرت عادت: قدرت عادتهای اثرگذار در چرخه‌ی زندگی»؛ ‬«قدرت عادت: چرایی کارهایی که انجام می دهیم، در زندگی و کسب و کار»؛ نویسنده: چارلز داهیگ؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز دهم ماه سپتامبر سال2014میلادیعنوان: قدرت عادت؛ نویسنده: چالز دوهینگ؛ مترجم: پروین بیات؛ تهران، هورمزد، سال‏‫1392؛ در335ص؛ شابک9786006958118؛ چاپ دوم سال1393؛ چاپهای چهارم تا هشتم سال1393؛ در352ص؛ چاپ دهم سال1394؛ در352ص؛ چاپ چهاردهم سال1396؛ چاپهای پانزدهم و شانزدهم سال1397؛ موضوع جنبه های اجتماعی عادت از نویسندگان ایالات متحده امریکا - سده21م‬عنوان: قدرت عادت: چرا کارهایی را در زندگی و کسب و کار انجام می‌دهیم؟ نویسنده: چارلز دوهیگ؛ مترجم: سکینه تقی زاده؛ اصفهان، گاهداد، سال1394؛ در340ص؛ شابک9786009382125؛عنوان: نقش و قدرت عادت‌ها در زندگی؛ نویسنده: چارلز داهیگ؛ مترجمها: ندا نایب‌پور، محمدرضا مینایی؛ اصفهان: آمیس، سال1395؛ در207ص؛ شابک9786005419795؛ عنوان: نیروی عادت: علت آنچه در زندگی و کارمان انجام می‌دهیم چیست؟ نویسنده: چالرز دیوهیگ؛ مترجم: علی هداوند؛ تهران پندار‌تابان‏‫، سال1395؛ در328ص؛ شابک9786006895598؛ چاپ دوم سال1396؛ چاپ سوم سال1397؛ چاپ چهارم سال1398؛عنوان: ‬قدرت عادت: چرایی کارهایی که انجام می دهیم، در زندگی و کسب و کار؛ نویسنده: چارلز داهیگ؛ مترجمها: مصطفی طرسکی، معصومه ثابت‌قدم؛ ویراستار: طاهره خیرآبادی؛ تهران نوین توسعه‏‫، سال‏‫‏‏‏‏‬1396؛ در329ص؛ شابک9786008738091؛ چاپهای دوم و سوم سال1396؛ چاپ هفتم سال1397؛عنوان: قدرت عادت : چرا ما در زندگی و کار اینگونه عمل می‌کنیم؟ نویسنده: چارلز دوهیگ ؛ مترجم: شهرزاد حکیم‌مختار؛ تهران معیار اندیشه، سال‏‫1398؛ در288ص؛ شابک9786005462746؛‬عنوان: قدرت عادت: دلیل هر آن چه در زندگی و کسب و کار انجام می‌دهیم؛ نویسنده: چارلز داهیگ؛ مترجم: الهام شریف؛ تهران : نسل نواندیش‏‫‬، سال1396؛ در344ص؛ شابک9789642369119؛ ‬عنوان: قدرت عادت: چرایی کارهایی که انجام می‌دهیم و چگونگی تغییر دادن آن‌ها؛ نویسنده: چارلز داهیگ؛ مترجم: اصغر اندرودی؛ کرج: در دانش بهمن،‏ سال1395؛ در342ص؛ شابک9789641741794؛ چاپ دوم سال1396؛ چاپهای سوم و چهارم سال1397؛عنوان: قدرت عادت؛ نویسنده: چارلز دوهیگ؛ مترجم: فروزنده دولتیاری؛ تهران: چابک اندیش، سال‏‫‏‏‏‏1397؛ در352ص؛ شابک9786005861259؛‬‬‬عنوان: قدرت عادت؛ نویسنده: چارلز داهیگ؛ مترجم: طیبه شیخی؛ قم: دارالفنون بوریا، سال‏‫1398؛ در270ص؛ شابک97862295661؛عنوان: قدرت عادت: علت کارهای که در کسب‌وکار و زندگی انجام می‌دهیم؛ نویسنده: چارلز دوهینگ؛ مترجم: زهرا شاه‌قلعه؛ قم: آوای بیصدا، سال‏‫1398؛ در368ص؛ شابک9786009926459؛عنوان: قدرت عادت: قدرت عادتهای اثرگذار در چرخه‌ی زندگی؛ نویسنده: کارلس (چارلز) دوهیگ؛ مترجم: مرجان فرجی؛ تهران،رشد، سال‏‫1398؛ در440ص؛ شابک9786003511248؛ کتاب «قدرت عادت» یکی از کتابهای پیروزمند روانشناسی است، که نخستین بار در سال2013میلادی توسط «چارلز دوهینگ» نگاشته شد، و به زودی از پرفروش‌ترین کتابهای «نیویورک» شد؛ «دوهینگ» در این کتاب بیان می‌کند، که این عادت‌های ما هستند، که زندگیمان را شکل می‌دهند، و «قدرت عادت» و تأثیر آن در زندگی انسان را بازنمایی می‌کنند؛ و در پی آن موضوع را بیان می‌کنند: (اگر انسان بتواند عادت‌های خود را تغییر بدهد، می‌تواند رفتار و زندگانی خود را نیز تغییر دهد)، و در پایان نیز الگوهایی برای دیگر کردن عادت‌ها ارائه می‌دهندتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 21/03/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ 01/01/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-c,Rating 1 out of 5,"This long-winded book explains how habits form in individuals, organizations, and social groups. Despite the intriguing premise, the verbose anecdotes left me screaming, “I get the point already!” A better book (or article) would have resulted from taking the appendix (a short, practical guide to changing a habit) and adding some of the psychological research and a few brief examples. (After I wrote this review, I discovered Charles Duhigg's New York Times article, which is basically what I described). The book’s moral is a respectable one: once you’re aware of a bad habit, it’s your responsibility to change it.My favorite case study was the one about Target using predictive analytics and behavioral research to personalize its marketing to each shopper’s habits.• A habit is a cue that triggers a routine that results in a reward.• Habits can’t be eradicated; they can only be replaced.• The Golden Rule of Habit Change: to replace a habit, keep the cue and reward but replace the routine.• “For a habit to stay changed, people must believe change is possible. And most often, that belief only emerges with the help of a group.”• Studies show that willpower is a finite resource; it's like a muscle that tires with use. Willpower can be increased by exercising self-discipline. Increasing self-discipline in one area of life increases it in other areas.• To introduce new habits, “sandwich” them between existing ones so they feel familiar.• Habits are most susceptible to being altered when your life changes. Having a baby is the event that produces the most habit changes."
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-mridula,Rating 4 out of 5,"I remember reading a story by the famous Malayalam writer Padmarajan called Oru Sameepakala Durantham (""A Tragedy of Recent Times""). It tells of a housing colony in Kerala, bitten by the exercise bug in the early eighties. Someone gets up before sunrise and starts jogging. Soon, he is joined by more and more people until the whole colony is out running, every day. This leaves the houses unattended which comes to the notice of a group of thieves: and they conduct a spate of early morning robberies. The people of the colony, even after a couple of houses are robbed, continue their morning ritual - they can't stop, even after they know that their houses may be invaded any time.Padmarajan ostensibly wrote this seemingly absurd and Kafkaesque story to make fun of the urban animal, blindly following the latest fad. But he may have more true to life than he thought.Such is the power of habit.------------------------------This book by Duhigg, if you can get past the unnecessarily prolix prose, says a very simple but significant thing: habit is what drives you. From picking your nose to gambling away your life's savings, ingrained habits hard-coded into your brain makes you tick. It follows the ""cue-routine-reward"" loop as illustrated below:(Cue = a certain time; routine = eat a cookie; reward = diversion from work)Habits are not endemic to people alone - organisations and societies also have habits, which why they are so resistant to change.The key to getting rid of a destructive habit is to replace it with a constructive one. In the loop illustrated above, the cue and the reward would remain the same, but a different routine can be substituted. See below:(Here the routine of ""have a drink"" is replaced with ""have a chat"")This is easier said than done, however: it requires real effort to identify a habit, and great will power (which can be cultivated, according to Duhigg) to change it. But it can be done. Successful individuals have changed their lives by changing destructive habits: successful executives have turned around companies by changing corporate habits: and leaders have transformed societies. Examples abound in this book.And please note: supermarket chains and gambling dens monitor our habits and feed those which will drain our pockets and maximise their profits.------------------------------This book is well worth a read. I only wish that the author had cut the fluff and trimmed it down to a slimmer volume. But then, the HABIT of writing needlessly long books among American journalists is one that dies hard."
10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/903066-johnny,Rating 5 out of 5,"Judging from the prologue of The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business, the first thing necessary in modifying one’s behavior is to note the actual components of that behavior. The author cites a visit with a military officer in charge of normalizing a village (Kufa) in Iraq. The officer started by observing video of how riots began and noticed that the trouble usually broke out after people had milled around for a while and food trucks and spectators arrived. He changed the behavior by asking the mayor not to allow food trucks into the areas where people were demonstrating (p. 13 on Sony eReader, as will be all pagination in the remainder of this review). Something as simple as the presence of food trucks threw off a habit of violence and allowed some normalization. This seemed amazing, but something resonated strongly with this truth.The Power of Habits begins with anecdotal accounts of people who changed destructive habits in their lives and one account of a man who had absolutely no short term memory but was able to function as a result of habits already ingrained within him. The latter case demonstrated that there was something distinctive between one part of our brain and another. So, the author takes the reader on a tour of a lab at M.I.T. where scientists have been researching a golf ball-sized lump in the brain called the basal ganglia since 1990 (p. 25). Apparently, the basal ganglia stores habits while the rest of the brain works less and less because the “chunks” of actions stored in that section of the brain takes over (p. 26). Arriving at this understanding, researchers were able to use different experiments to ascertain a “habit loop.” They noticed that a certain cue triggers a set of automatic reactions such that the being feels rewarded. As a result of being rewarded, there is an even stronger response to the same cue on the next occasion (p. 29) Of course, if reward can reinforce the habit whenever one senses that cue, changing the reward can eventually extinguish that habit (p. 30) as the researchers discovered by moving the chocolate around the maze to mess up the behaviors.So, what kinds of “cues” work? The Power of Habits tells the story of Claude Hopkins, an advertising legend who “created” the demand for toothpaste by creating a “craving.” Hopkins noticed in dental research that there is a film that forms on our teeth. He decided to get people to “feel” the mucin plaques on their teeth by calling them “the film” and suggesting that “beauty” comes from eliminating the film (p. 40). By identifying a “cue” (the film that is almost always there) and suggesting a “reward” (getting rid of that film), he established a multi-million dollar product. Sounds simple, doesn’t it? Yet, the book goes on to tell the story of Febreze, the air freshener that started out as a failure. Even though it was extremely effective in getting rid of odors, it wasn’t selling because people in odiferous situations became used to the odors. They weren’t getting the cue. So, there had to be a better way to cue the reward and that came to be with pleasant fragrances and the idea of “finishing” a task with beautiful smelling Febreze (a tactic that is still being used in dozens of new products in this product line to the present day (p. 56). The “habit loop” works even better when a “craving” is attached to it. It turns out that Pepsodent already had the craving element built in with the citric acid or mint taste that rewarded users with a tingling sense of feeling clean. It’s pretty masterful the way this author closes the loop in each chapter.Then, a chapter introduces the “Golden Rule” of habit change. It notes that you can never quite remove a bad habit, but you need to substitute a new routine between the cue and the reward (p. 61). In this chapter, Tony Dungy’s coaching philosophy of substituting a simpler playbook with more repetition for the old routine of over-thinking what one might be trying to do. In this way, the new routine would reside between the cue (hiking the ball?) and the reward (scoring a touchdown? Making a sack of the QB?) and more success would result (p. 62). Naturally, this chapter wraps Dungy’s experiences with turning around the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Indianapolis Colts football teams around the history of Alcoholics Anonymous. Both Dungy as a coach and Bill Wilson who founded A.A. teach people to substitute new routines for the old ones (p. 68), bad football in the former and alcohol abuse in the latter.One of the keys to Dungy’s eventual success and one of the core tenets of A.A. (or any 12-step) program is that one must believe in something. Dungy complained early on that practice was going well and everything was coming together, but the training would disappear during the big games. When he heard the players saying that they went back to what they knew during critical games, Dungy said, “What they were really saying was that they trusted our system most of the time, but when everything was on the line, that belief broken down.” (p. 75) And, as one researching from the University of New Mexico noted, belief is critical in order for change to work in the long run (p. 78). The section on “habits” in business wasn’t as interesting to me, but even there I found some intriguing aspects. It was fascinating to read about how “keystone habits encourage widespread change: by creating cultures where new values become ingrained.” (p. 109) This section told the story of former U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O’ Neill’s success at Alcoa. O’ Neill’s emphasis was safety. By placing the emphasis on safety, he gave the corporation something around which management (because of reducing lost work days) and unions (because of emphasizing the safety of the workers) could both agree upon. There was also an insight with regard to the gay liberation movement. Duhigg suggests that when the Library of Congress re-categorized books on homosexuality as its own subject matter rather than under mental illness, it provided a paradigm shift that fueled the movement (p. 100). It just shows how little shifts can have seismic effects, not only on individuals, but on society.Another corporate chapter used an experiment on willpower where half of the group was allowed to eat fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies while another group was forced to eat radishes. Sounds like the latter would have a healthy advantage when the group was asked to perform a complex problem which had no real solution! Sounds like they would be more mentally fresh! Wrong! Those who had eaten the radishes were most likely to quit after only a few minutes while the cookie eaters kept on for half an hour or so. Why? Researchers concluded that the first portion of the experiment had used up much of the finite willpower in the radish eaters (p. 119). A later study showed that using kindness to set up the willpower goals as opposed to ordering willpower allowed those who experienced kindness to concentrate longer (p. 130).Building on that idea, Duhigg recounted a Scottish rehabilitation study where the elderly patients who were most successful in learning to walk again in spite of excruciating pain had identified potential obstacles in advance and created their own ways of dealing with them. “Put another way, the patients’ plans were built around inflection points when they knew their pain—and thus the temptation to quit—would be the strongest.” (p. 124) Starbucks put this to work in what they called the LATTE method (Listen to the customer, Acknowledge their complaint, Take action by solving the problem, Thank them, and then, Explain why the problem occurred.) in dealing with irate customers (p. 126).Another chapter deals with destructive institutional habits: “There are no organizations without institutional habits. There are only places where they are deliberately designed, and places where they are created without forethought, so they often grow from rivalries or fear.” (p. 137) “Companies aren’t families. They’re battlefields in a civil war.” (p. 139) I was also fascinated with the chapter on consumer behavior. Did you know that almost everyone turns right after entering a retail establishment and that retailers stock their most profitable items on the right side of the store? (p. 157) Did you know that people’s buying habits change when they go through a major life event (marriage, having a child, divorce, moving)? (p. 162) And, in the facts are stranger than fiction department, Duhigg cites a company named Polyphonic HMI that statistically analyzes the mathematical characters of a song and predicts its popularity. (p. 167) Why is that strange? It’s because Norman Spinrad, a terrific science-fiction author, “predicts” it in his novel in the 1980s--Little Heroes. Sorry, Duhigg doesn’t cite Spinrad; that’s me. I was happy that Duhigg recounted a huge Polyphonic miscalculation. It also explained why I don’t listen to music on the radio very much: “Our brains crave familiarity in music because familiarity is how we manage to hear without becoming distracted by all the sound.” (p. 171) I actually listen to the radio for stimuli.The section on the habits of societies was particularly relevant to me because the first chapter dealt with churches, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s Montgomery church and Rick Warren’s Saddleback Community Church. Starting with the idea of a social network of friendships and growing through informal ties (Duhigg calls them “weak ties”) and changing community habits, social habits turn on personal integrity and relationships. Duhigg pointed out how Rosa Park’s ties that transcended the social stratifications of the black community through her volunteer involvement with many groups on many levels enabled her to become the catalyst that she was (p. 184) The important insight that was new to me was: “The habits of peer pressure … often spread through weak ties. And they gain their authority through communal expectations. If you ignore the social obligations of your neighborhood, if you shrug off the expected patterns of your community, you risk losing your social standing.” (p. 189) Sadly, I was disappointed in the section on Rick Warren. The book makes it sound like Warren selected Saddleback Community from a long way away by citing Warren’s seminary education in Texas and work as a volunteer missionary in Japan. Strangely, it doesn’t mention the fact that Saddleback was only a little more 30 minutes drive from where Warren attended college in Riverside or that Warren’s father had been a professional minister in California prior to his retirement. I did like the emphasis on small groups as the key to creating a “sticky” environment that “…drew on already-existing social urges and patterns.” (p. 198) One significant section of the book was dedicated to the idea of whether we are responsible for our habits. By juxtaposing the tale of a gambler (if you listen to This American Life on public radio, you probably heard this story) who went to court with a major casino chain by insisting that the casino operators were responsible for her problem alongside that of a British subject who killed his wife during sleep terrors, Duhigg raises the issue but concludes by stating that he believes it is possible to change habits—any habits. The gambler protested that she just wanted to feel good at something (p. 208) and the killer protested that he honestly thought his wife was a male intruder assaulting his wife (p. 209).This section pointed out that, for example, sleepwalking is a reminder that sleep and wakefulness aren't that separate so that the brain can accomplish complex activities and nothing is guiding the brain except patterns. (pp. 210-211) Even more powerful are the behaviors described as “sleep terrors.” Sleep terrors are primitive neurological patterns (p.212). It even points out that a 2010 MRI study of gamblers discovered that, to pathological gamblers, brain activity was so high that it treated near misses as wins (p.220) when, in fact, they were losses. So, can such ingrained perceptions be changed? Duhigg cites William James’ decision to believe in free will as opposed to surrendering to suicide (p. 226). As James tried his 12 month long experiment, he discovered that habits were based upon exercising them (pp. 226-227) much like a well-folded paper or an old pair of well-creased slacks. And all of these great narratives point the reader toward the most useful part of the book, learning to change behavior by identifying the routine, figuring out the cue that triggers the routine and the craving underlying that cue by experimenting with different rewards (p. 230). If you can figure out what you really want and substitute a better routine to satisfy that craving, you will be well on your way toward changing that habit. That doesn’t mean you won’t fall off the wagon, but it means you will be on your way to shaping your actions by your will as opposed to ingrained behaviors."

I saw a friend currently reading it. I thought this book explained some useful information: Talked about success through good habits - organizational skills ----addictions- habits hard to break and how to create new ones --lots of repetition. ( some basic common sense - but also good tidbits and even validation in some areas) The personal stories of people's lives were interesting.... and my favorite part about reading this book was the book discussion with the people in my book club group after.

13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4810137-arda,Rating 4 out of 5,"Enjoyable. The book presents a framework of understanding how habits work, and serves as a guide to show how to change habits.  “Once you choose who you want to be, believe you want to change, and it becomes real.” “Visualize the kind of person you would like to become, focus on one habit you would potentially develop, and transform that into what would become natural; requiring no effort or thinking.” “To modify a habit, you must decide to change it. You must consciously accept the hard work of identifying the cues and rewards that drive the habit’s routines and find alternatives. You must know you have control, and be self conscious enough to use it.” And hence, the  power of habit. So far so good. At this point I’m thinking “which one, which one!” I have a big list of those things I’d be more than happy to trash, and a bigger list of habits I’d like to build. According to Duhigg, the habit loop is made up of: cue → routine → reward. 

Let’s assume  I have a habit of reviewing books on goodreads. This habit of reviewing would be a cue, which makes up the routine: logging into my account, adding books and reviewing them. Apparently, habits (cue and routine) often require a reward. What would my reward in this scenario possibly be? A like? A comment? I hardly get any of those. Perhaps the reward comes from the deeper  craving  I have to read more books. Craving apparently is what drives the habit loop. Hence: Cue → Routine → Reward. The driver is the craving. And the extra spices are belief, and will-power. (Self-discipline increases will-power.)The beauty of realizing this power is that “at first, the change comes with difficulty, then it is done more easily, then semi-mechanically or with hardly any consciousness.” Our actions are developed into habits when we stop thinking about them consciously. We just do them. Hence, we rebuild and transform them. Changing a keystone habit, like say, working out, can transform a person’s life, because with the habit of working out, one is going to simultaneously eat in a healthier way, possibly quit smoking, and live a better lifestyle which in turn could turn to a happier life.  EUREKA!  As based on the above, it would be fair to presume that due to my habit of writing reviews on goodreads, I will start to read more books, thanks to my craving, and this will in turn increase my reviews. I would have no idea what to do with those reviews, and so I might have a chance of reaching success and becoming famous by turning into a fraud replica of  Manny  who published a book about his reviews of books. And, to take it a little further, according to the habit loop, I may just as well meet the love of my life as a result of all this success, which would in turn stop me from eating so much ice cream.

On a serious note, Duhigg generously provides diverse examples to explain the habit loop. The examples range from personal experiences, such as depression/addiction (alcohol, gambling, overeating, etc) and memory-loss. And yet, some of the success stories got on my nerves at a certain point. I was a tad annoyed, early in the book, that he draws inspiration from the US Military and the ways through which habits are instilled in soldiers. Moreover, he includes a section on radio/music, concluding that the reason Outkast’s “Hey Ya” turned out to be such a hit despite the public’s initial disdain is because “the unfamiliar was made to seem familiar” through playing it with familiar songs. “If you dress a new something in an old habit,"" he explains, ""it is easier for the public to accept it.” (Which public?)He brings examples from sports games, shopping malls (like target) and coffee chains (like Starbucks) and others markets like Alcoa and Febreeze to display how the habit loop works. He mentions that ""companies predict and manipulate habits” and briefly remarks on how some customers do not like to be spied on for marketing purposes, yet it still seems as though Duhigg uses his examples as success stories. He does not seem to mind the data-mining and tracking of records or ethical standards so much, and focuses instead on how to make success out of this “secret”. [Speaking of which, did you know pregnant women are the biggest shoppers?] I was a little taken-aback by his corporate-success-mindedness and the ways in which he measures success. This would be a little too similar to the mind-set one finds in other self-help books, although I was hoping this one would be different. Unfortunately, most of these types of books seem to promote the sensation of becoming a driven, ambitious, goal-oriented, go-get-‘em tiger. I couldn’t help escape the idea that this man partly measures success by a person’s pay-check and exercise regimen.

That said, the book does have interesting viewpoints, particularly those related to how habits shape up societies. His take on habits within communities was eye-opening: He defines community as a giant collection of habits occurring among thousands of people that, depending on how they’re influenced, could result in violence or peace. He takes the example of Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott in Alabama in 1955, and states that it was not just an act of defiance that sparked the boycott, but that the successful boycott was also due to her varying and influential social circles. In this section, as in other sections, attention is given to the importance of social standing, which comes with obligations. Apparently, it is not just our friends who strengthen our social networks, but the friends of our friends [“weak ties”] too have a role in improving our chances for finding employment and improve our social standing. One of the integral points that will stand out for me from this book is that our actions are developed into habits when we stop thinking about them consciously. We just do them. Hence, we rebuild and transform them. Changing, or building, the most simple habit could have a direct impact on our mortal life. “However,"" Duhigg warns, ""there isn’t one formula. Individuals are different, habits are different, and cravings are different. What this book aspires to do is create a framework of understanding how a habit works, and serve as a guide to show how to change it.”"
14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was an interesting collection of research about habits and routines. The book felt Gladwellian in that it combined a variety of case studies while arguing a central theme, just as Malcolm Gladwell tends to do in his books. I think my favorite sections were the ones on Starbucks' training programs, Procter & Gamble's attempts to market Febreze, the safety record at Alcoa, the applications of Hit Song Science, and the historic Montgomery bus boycott of 1955. The overall theme is about how habits shape our lives, and it is possible to change bad habits for positive routines. The trick is in identifying what is cueing you to the bad habit, to experiment with positive rewards, and then make a plan for how to adjust your routine. This material was also explored in Gretchen Rubin's charming book, Better Than Before, and I enjoyed revisiting the topic. Recommended for those interested in human behavior and popular psychology/sociology."

The advice on habit change ultimately comes down to the appendix with the author's personal anecdote about trying to lose weight. The conclusion is obvious and it's not science; it's just some dude's story. People looking for books on using increased awareness of thought loops to change habits would be better served reading something about cognitive therapy or meditation. 

 

 Managing Your Mind: The Mental Fitness Guide Wherever You Go, There You Are: Mindfulness Meditation in Everyday LifeMuch of what he is talking about with automatic responses to external cues goes back to century-old findings about Pavlov's dogs, and one of the people interviewed even describes what they're doing as ""Pavlovian"" so that's not new. The actual new science is the fashionable brain biology stuff, which is still not very practical. It's like taking apart your GPS after a road trip to see if you had a good vacation. Brainwashed: The Seductive Appeal of Mindless NeuroscienceOne of the most basic concepts in science is to compare apples to apples and oranges to oranges, but the author mixes things up so much that it's like a fruit salad. Sleepwalking is a habit? Murder is a habit? Does ""habit"" mean anything??? Useful scientific advice on behavior change would tell us about controlled experiments of things that helped people. This book instead gives us lots of theories with a ""loop"" diagram that doesn't even make sense. According to the loop, you need an immediate reward to establish a long-term habit. But, for example, in the chapter about the Superbowl coach, nowhere is it explained what the immediate reward is for performing the correct behaviors thousands of times. Winning the game is the reward, but a losing team doesn't get that for years, if ever."

20,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,Rating 4 out of 5,"While this book kept popping in my feeds and conversations since many years, somehow got to reading it only now.This is a well-researched book. The underlying premise is a good one – we carry out many actions as a result of habits rather than by careful evaluation, it is the way our brain develops. By recognizing how this happens, we have an opportunity to change our habits. The format of how we act out our habits is a simple loop of a cue which triggers anticipation, after which we follow-up a familiar good feeling pattern of action, which results in a reward we crave for. If we can recognize the cues and the rewards we crave, we can make substitutions in our actions to derive an equivalent satisfaction with some other action. Another key requirement is strengthening belief that this can be done. Some keystone habits can have a cascading trigger of effects across many dimensions and this is very well explained. Most of the examples are good ones though in a few cases apparently, I have different cues or times have changes. Eg: Pepsodent really took off and in fact more people starting including paste in their med-kits and brushing as a result – the message “there is a film which forms around our teeth and Pepsodent helps you get over it”, and the tingling sensation most pastes now leave in your mouth. There are other good examples – why some people are unable to resist the urge to gamble, intake drugs or smoke. There are others – how Target customizes its coupons (including marketing to pregnant women subtly), the Starbucks induction program to enable employees to handle all kinds of customers, Febreze – odour neutralizer, the ‘Hey Ya’ song which was marketed for success.This is a very readable book – it has a good mix of neuroscience, research and some interesting stories. The appendix with tips on changing habits should actually be part of the main section itself. Some of the neuroscience quoted is still evolving though. Also, while the habit loop is abstracted to a nice simple flow, it does not ask a key question – what if your underlying reward craving is in itself flawed/misdirected? How can you graduate your thinking to a higher purpose and form habits which address that?An intellectually stimulating read, which I recommend.I have this habit of accumulating far more books than I can read. Will I now be able to beat that habit? I think not – but then I do not yet have the belief that I can do it 😊"

If we are more aware of why and how habits are formed, then we'll be able to control them. That's exactly what ""The Power of Habit"" tries to accomplish!This well-researched book consults academic studies, interviews with many scientists and executives, and research conducted at various companies. I had heard some lessons from this book by watching a few YouTube videos, but reading it was such a fun experience!One of the most useful takeaways from this book is that habits are powerful but also delicate. They can be formed outside our consciousness or with our intention. They can form without our permission but can be reshaped by us. Old habits never disappear, but we can change them by altering the cues and rewards.The book is split into three parts. The first part focuses on the habits of individuals, second on habits of successful organizations, and third on habits of societies. It was interesting to read about the research and real-life examples of how habits work on three levels.This book isn't a detailed guide on how to form habits but focuses more on the research aspects and the nitty-gritty of habits, right from how to form them and factors that influence them. I highly enjoyed reading about the habits of organization and societies as it was something new to me. I learned some useful information on habits I'll summarize in another post!All in all, it's a book worth reading!INSTAGRAM"

People have such wide-ranging interests and value sets that whenever anyone asks me for that kind of one-size-fits-all book - and they often do, given I have a nonfiction-focused YouTube channel - I resist giving an answer. But if forced, I always suggest this book since habits are something all of us have. They influence our lives in dramatic ways and in The Power of Habit, Charles Duhigg first explains the science of how habits work in our brains and then goes on to demonstrate how they work in personal, organizational, and social capacities using fascinating anecdotes ranging from how a CEO turned around a struggling steel-producing company through focusing on safety standards, to how a man was found not guilty of murdering his wife because he was in the midst of a sleep terror.I've read many books that blend science and anecdote before and since reading (and now, rereading) this book and no one does it as smoothly and engagingly as Duhigg. You'll be entertained and you'll learn things that you can immediately start applying to your own life. This is one of the best and most widely-appealing nonfiction books out there. Don't miss it!"
23,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1627772-amin-dorosti,Rating 3 out of 5,  این کتاب یکی از چهار/پنج کتابی‌ست که من در زمینه  موفقیت و رشد شخصی  و موضوعات مرتبط با آن در طول حدود ده سال اخیر مطالعه کرده‌ام، آن قبلی‌ها که هیچ کدام حتی ذره‌ای هم برایم آموزنده و جالب نبودند، و معمولا هم نیمه‌کاره رها شدند، اما این یکی کمی تا اندکی خوب بود و تا آخر خوانده شد درباره کتاب قدرت عادتنخست. من به طور کلی با فضای کتاب‌های حوزه موفقیت مشکل دارم (دلیل آن را خواهم گفت) و هیچ‌گاه هم نتوانستم با آن‌ها به قولی حال کنم. پس بی‌تردید گزارش من جهت‌گیری دارددوم. گذشته از این قضاوت‌های شخصی من! این کتاب البته با فضای رایج کتاب‌های ژانر موفقیت متفاوت بود و به همین دلیل هم تا حدی از آن خوشم آمد! در واقع این کتاب ساختاری تقریبا علمی دارد و بیش از آنکه درباره موفقیت باشد، درباره تلاش برای بهبود رفتارها و عملکردهای شخصی هست و از این رو می‌تواند در جای خود مفید هم باشد به طور مشخص ایدۀ اصلی کتاب چنین استبسیاری از رفتارها و کنش‌های روزانه ما ناشی از عادت‌های ماست. کنش‌های ناشی از عادت، دربردارندۀ سه بخش هستند: سرنخ، روتین، پاداش. نکته مهم دربارۀ چرخۀ عادت این است که ما در طول این چرخه از کنش‌های خود، آگاه نیستیم و بدون تصمیم‌گیری و سنجش و گزینش عمل می‌کنیم. به عنوان مثال فرآیند رانندگی یکی از این عادت‌هاست. نکته جالب در مورد چرخۀ عادت این است که در این چرخه‌ها می‌توان یک روتین جدید را جایگزین یک روتین دیگر کرد. بنابراین می‌توان با همان سرنخ و پاداش قبلی، یک روتین دیگر را جایگزین یک روتین مضر کرد. با این ترفند می‌توان بسیاری از عادت‌های نادرست همچون اعتیاد را از بین برد. البته در این میان برای ادامۀ چرخۀ عادت ِ روتین جدید، به یک عامل دیگر نیز نیازمندیم:  باور یا اعتقاد.  در واقع باور به اینکه می‌توانیم تغییر کنیم و می‌توانیم عادات نادرست خود را از بین ببریم یک تحلیل کلی درباره کتاب‌های ژانر موفقیت  همانگونه که در بالا اشاره کردم، این کتاب درباه بهبود رفتارهای شخصی است و از این رو با سایر کتاب‌های ژانر موفقیت (کتاب‌های با عناوینی همچون یک شبه میلیونر شوید یا سه ساعته فیلسوف شوید و غیره) بسیار متفاوت است. با این حال با توجه به این که کتاب‌های ژانر موفقیت این روزها به شدت همه‌گیر شده‌اند در اینجا تحلیل و نقد کوتاهی از این کتاب‌ها می‌آورم. هر چند که این تحلیل چندان ارتباطی با کتاب قدرت عادت ندارداساسا منطقی که در پس کتاب‌های ژانر موفقیت نهفته است از بن و بنیاد ایراد دارد! اگر از گونه‌های مبتذل‌تر منطق آن‌ها (مثلا اینکه هر چه را که آرزو کنید و با تمام وجود خواهان آن باشید به واقعیت تبدیل می‌شود) بگذریم، این منطق به ساده‌ترین شکل چنین است: «هرکسی می‌تواند با تلاش شخصی خود موفق شود». این منطق به نظر من منطقی به شدت بی بنیاد و فریب‌دهنده است، چرا که می‌خواهد همه چیز را به خودِ فرد ارتباط دهد و سایر موارد موثر محیطی همچون شرایط سیاسی، اجتماعی ، اقتصادی، فرهنگی و غیره و به ویژه فاصله‌ طبقاتی و تقسیم ناعادلانه فرصت‌ها که ناشی از نظام‌های سرمایه‌سالار است را پنهان کند‍! در واقع نخستین نتیجه‌ای که بی‌درنگ از این منطق بیرون می‌آید چنین است: اگر آقای ایکس امروز میلیاردر است، این ثروت صرفا ناشی از تلاش و توانایی شخصی خود اوست و نه ناشی از شرایط خانوادگی خاص او و ثروتی که از پدرش به او رسیده و هزاران رانت و لابی و فرصت نابرابر و غیره؛ و اگر شمایی که امروز محتاج پول توجیبی ماهانه خودت هستی در این شرایط ناگور به سر میبری باز هم این شرایط صرفا ناشی از ناتوانی و بی‌لیاقتی و تلاش نکردن خود شخص ِ تو است و بس! و جامعه و شرایط و فرصت‌های اقتصادی و سیاست و فرهنگ و خانواده و هزار عامل کوچک و بزرگ دیگر هیچ نقشی در این بدبختی تو ندارند! خنده دار نیست؟؟ به باور من اتفاقا این منطق را بیش از همه همان آدم‌هایی که با بهره‌گیری از هزاران دوپینگ توانسته‌اند به ثروت و قدرت برسند تبلیغ می‌کنند! چرا که خودشان هم به خوبی می‌دانند که دوپینگ کرده‌اند و از این رو فرافکنی می‌کنند تا دوپینگ آن‌ها لو نرود. اما از این نقد کلی که بگذریم، فضای این‌گونه کتاب‌ها نیز به شدت فریب‌دهنده و به دور از واقعیت است، و بیش از هر چیز فرد را از واقعیت‌های زندگانی و جامعه جدا می‌سازد و در رویاهای دروغین غوطه‌ور می‌کند. افزون بر این ها، از نظر محتوا و به تعبیری حرف اصلی و لب کلام نیز فقری عجیب و غریب در این کتاب‌ها به چشم می‌خورد! به گونه‌ای که گاه می‌توان کل حرف حساب کتاب را در یک پاراگراف آورد! حال آن‌که نویسنده صدها صفحه را برای تکرار همین یک پارگراف سیاه کرده است! در تحلیل نهایی بر این باورم که این کتاب‌ها راست می‌گویند! آن‌ها راه موفقیت هستند! البته راه موفقیت برای نویسنده کتاب‌ها و نه خواننده آن‌ها! چرا که نویسنده با نوشتن و فروش همین کتاب‌ها پول خوبی به جیب می‌زند! البته نه در کشور ما، بلکه در کشورهای دارای قانون کپی رایت که بهای یک جلد از همین کتاب‌های موفقیت گاهی به صد تا دویست دلار می‌رسد جوینده و پاینده باشیدامین درستی
24,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,Rating 3 out of 5,"How do some of us wake up for 6 a.m. jogs every day? What leads people to develop gambling addictions? Why do people brush their teeth every day while never remembering to wear sunscreen? Charles Duhigg answers these questions and more in The Power of Habit, a well-researched book on what motivates us to make the decisions we do in everyday life and in business.Duhigg's background as a reporter shows in this book. He does a good job of stringing together a wide variety of topics to fit his thesis that revolves around habit, and for the most part he writes about the cue-routine-reward cycle. To illustrate how that pattern works and what we can do to change it, Duhigg explores ideas like smoking addiction, sleepwalking, Target tracking down pregnant women, and more. His writing shines when he compares the man who murdered his wife while asleep to the women who lost an enormous sum of money to compulsive gambling: I still find myself thinking about the neurological and moral implications of the distinction he presents.However, the writing in this book faltered at times. In certain sections Duhigg would break up anecdotes and combine them in odd, confusing ways. Sometimes he selected scenarios that did not align too well with his arguments, like his exploration of how ""Hey-Ya"" became popular. The book as a whole veered more toward reporting than research, so bear that in mind if you decide to pick it up.Overall, a decent read I wanted a little more from when I finished. Recommended to those who want to get their feet wet when it comes to habit formation or psychology that deals with motivation. I will end with a quote from The Power of Habit that stood out to me in a good way:That, in some ways, is the point of this book. Perhaps a sleepwalking murderer can plausibly argue that he wasn't aware of his habit, and so he doesn't bear responsibility for his crime. But almost all the other patterns that exist in most people's lives - how we eat and sleep and talk to our kids, how we unthinkingly spend our time, attention, and money - those are habits that we know exist. And once you understand that habits can change, you have the freedom - and the responsibility - to remake them. Once you understand that habits can be rebuilt, the power of habit becomes easier to grasp, and the only option left is to get to work."

I finished a non-fiction book!So, I started this climbing excursion because I have bad habits. We all do most of the time. My bad habits are eating unhealthy food, drinking too much wine, not getting enough exercise or procrastinating at work. My hubby and I thought, let’s figure out WHY since we both have bad habits we want to stop. We started this buddy read in February. February?! And you're just finishing it? Now don’t let that sway you that it took over two months to finish this book. It’s not a bad read, I just took my time with it, it's non-fiction and of course, I read books in between. ;) hahahaSo, did it answer some of my questions? Will I put down the bag of Cheetos next time I drink too much wine?! Yeah, I think it did.The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business helped me understand that stopping a bad habit isn’t the easiest thing to do. Don't beat yourself up about it. They become routine, habitual and ingrained in your life. They are caused by stress, emotions and going back to creature comforts. The book addresses that one of the ways to break a bad habit is to replace it with a substitute. It’s one of the ways to make a lasting change.Technically, this book isn’t bad. The author jumps around a bit with stories, starting one narrative and then going to another. Depending on the subject matter, I was okay with this. When I was really into the subject matter, it annoyed the hell out of me.This book is also a good analysis about why people like what they do, buy from a certain store or buy merchandise. The businesses that are smart, they have tapped into the emotion of advertising and habits. This part of the book was fascinating and was interesting material to read. And it confirmed that a lot of our bad habits are subliminal because of ads, commercials and radio.Why 4 stars? I didn’t really need that much business data and could have used a bit more personal.We are creatures of habit and it’s really on to you and whether you can make the change or not. Belief plays a big role in our daily success. I hope that I can use some of the tips in this book to finally implement some changes."
26,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21413858-k-j-charles,No Rating,"A book of three halves. (What, I don't do maths.) The first third gets right into the way habits work (cue, behaviour, reward) and explains them really well--including why it's incredibly hard to break a habit but much easier to redirect one (identify your cue and reward, change the behaviour that links them). It's one of those super enlightening books that makes you want to tell everyone you meet about it, incredibly useful. Lots of stories about habits, good and bad, and people who changed them, and the things that make it easier to change (depressingly often includes some equivalent of 'divine revelation'). I really wanted more on the habit cascade thing, whereby making one small change can trigger a series of changes. The second part is about the 'habits' of companies which is pretty interesting, but also kind of horrible in how corporate minded it is (developing healthy company habits is great because your workers spend more time at work!). The third part is more society-wide, with particular focus on a woman who sued casinos for their predatory marketing directed at compulsive gamblers, which ends with the author's agreement that it was her fault for not breaking her gambling habit, not the casinos for actively exploiting addiction to bankrupt vulnerable people, which...okay, we'll have to agree to differ on whether predatory corporates are good, I guess!The first third is really great, but the capitalist running doggery did not appeal to me. Also the author has a slightly annoying habit of nesting stories. But the first third is super worth reading, best analysis of habits I've yet encountered. "

Left to its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any routine into a habit, because habits allow our minds to ramp down more often."" pgs 17-18Duhigg describes how the brain creates a ""habit loop"" through cues, routines and rewards. These three elements feed on themselves until an ingrained habit is made. And, once it is there, it takes very little to upkeep.That's good news and bad news, because it works the same way for healthy and unhealthy habits.""But the reason the discovery of the habit loop is so important is that it reveals a basic truth: When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making."" pg 20The ""golden rule"" for changing a habit, Duhigg says, is to keep the same cues and rewards, but change the routine that leads to them. It sounds simple, but everyone is different with different motivations. So, it takes a bit of self awareness to discover what those unique cues and rewards are for you. But, once you know your triggers and motivations, that's when the fun begins of crafting a new routine.I found this book to be absolutely fascinating. It's also making me question the habits I've picked up in my own life. Am I certain that they are ones I want to continue? I can think of a few that could use a bit of tweaking.

31,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7236889-scott,Rating 4 out of 5,"Duhigg's Power of Habit offered a staggering statistic about our lives: 40% of what we do is habitual. 40 percent! That means that a huge majority of what we do in our lives is practically unconscious and habitually helping us progress or digress. The major takeaways for me include two main insights. First, identifying your habit's cues and rewards gives one understanding of why we do what we do. For example, when analyzing my habit of running, there are specific cues and rewards that both initiate and reward my exercising. My cues revolve around clearing my head and feeling accomplishment. I run either in the morning (after I wake up) or after work (after a long day at school/work) to clear my head. Also, I desire to accomplish something everyday, and running fulfills that craving. If I run in the morning, then I feel that I've already accomplished something that day. The second takeaway from this book is the principle of small victories. When you have a series of small victories, then your days can't help but to be filled with successful habits. For example, I feel accomplishment with a morning run. After a great start to the day, other small victories come more easily. I'm more positive,I want to eat healthy, I have more patience, and I work more efficiently. It's just a balanced way to live life. Identifying Cues/Rewards and earning Small victories changes habits and subsequently 40% of your life. "
32,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75748905-elizabeth,Rating 1 out of 5,"Gambling, shopping, alcohol, drugs—this book isn’t about Vegas, or perhaps a brief mention is there, but it is about how so many of these habits are held to a degree of fascination, even down to the biological encoding in the brain for the simple act of brushing our teeth. As much as we focus on cold reasoning or our explicit memories to guide our behavior, we know well enough that those pesky habits have a vital influence on our behavior. I’m no psychology expert, but even I get hopelessly lured into the prospect of discovering what makes people tick. Or, as Charles Duhigg would explain in The Power of Habit, the cue-routine-reward loop that makes them tick. We are in many ways a bundle of habits, bad or good. From the act of putting toothpaste on a toothbrush to the litany of maneuvers for backing a car out of a driveway, Duhigg discusses individualized habit loops in detail in Part One. From a cue to a routine to a reward, this loop becomes increasingly effortless until the brain can divert focus to other tasks. He delves into some interesting examples about how cravings can drive habits: the cool, tingling sensation of toothpaste caused by chemical irritants or the foaming action of shampoos, neither of which actually contribute to cleanliness but are essential to our belief in it. “Habits...aren’t destiny,” and AA can succeed by having you commit as part of a group to replace the drinking routine while keeping the same cues and rewards, thereby altering the habit.The anecdotes go on, initially demonstrative but increasingly interspersed in a narrative that fails to form strong arguments. The examples began feeling more like pithy tidbits of trivia than contributors to a central thesis about detangling the way habits work. Somehow, discussing drug addicts, advertisements that target shopping habits, and Rosa Parks as a successful trigger of a bus boycott all sound individually compelling by way of habit formation. At the same time, the fragmented zigzagging between all these different threads became more tedious to follow than enlightening. Part Two and Three focus on habits of successful organizations and habits of societies, which only piled on more tenuously supported examples that kept filing away at my enjoyment. It’s hard to center on large takeaways from The Power of Habit that I couldn’t already put a finger on or read an infographic about. For a book that could have tackled the real science behind habit formation, it was accessible yet contained more divining than explicating. Other than a satchel of varied anecdotes about habits that I could handily wield in a Russian roulette trivia game, I must relegate myself to patiently waiting for a time when backing out of a driveway driving will become a habit. I am a verified hazard on the road, and until quarantine is over, I can’t imagine that happening anytime soon!"

It was a pretty long book, definitely a re-read.Notes:- If you remove certain arts of the brain it can effect memory, and tasks, habits don't rely on memory parts of the brain which is interesting - the brains basal ganglia basically is the habit forming/storing area- habits, scientists say, emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort - it's like a computer cache system, if it loads a page it remembers the page so it doesn't have to load it from scratch again - we can devote mental energy to new ideas and concepts etc- Habits are formed by cravings, there's a cue, a routine, and a reward- People crave the tingly feeling of minty toothpaste because it makes them think the product has done something, that it has had an effect. Fabreeze has the fresh smell at the end of your cleaning which creates a craving for that scent and that feeling of accomplishment - “It seems ridiculously simple, but once you’re aware of how your habit works, once you recognize the cues and rewards, you’re halfway to changing it”- “We know that a habit cannot be eradicated—it must, instead, be replaced. And we know that habits are most malleable when the Golden Rule of habit change is applied: If we keep the same cue and the same reward, a new routine can be inserted. But that’s not enough. For a habit to stay changed, people must believe change is possible. And most often, that belief only emerges with the help of a group.”- Willpower is a muscle, you can use it all up for the day and it will become exhausted- Starbucks allowed autonomy among their employee's and this increased morale"

E o carte bună de citit la început de an, când încă avem energia dată de fixarea unor obiective mărețe, de care, prin martie, nu mai știm nimic. Charles Duhigg, câștigător de Pulitzer, intră destul de adânc în problema aceasta a deprinderilor și ne oferă - prin exemple, povești amuzante și motivaționale deopotrivă, dar și multe referințe științifice - rețeta prin care putem să schimbăm orice obicei. Citind cartea, mi-am dat seama că am aplicat formula lui Duhigg de fiecare dată când am înlocuit un obicei nociv cu unul sănătos. Rețeta pare foarte simplă, deși nu este deloc ușor de aplicat. Bazându-se pe studiile citate, Duhigg demonstrează că orice deprindere poate fi schimbată dacă păstrăm semnalul declanșator și recompensa, dar înlocuim rutina. Vă dau un exemplu. Soția mea, Monica, a pregătit ieri o delicioasă brânză macadamia, împreună cu niște chifle din făină fără gluten. Acum un an, Monica ar fi preparat un senzațional pate de ficat, pentru gustările de peste zi din weekend. Așadar, ce s-a întâmplat aici. Am păstrat semnalul (pofta de ceva bun) și recompensa (mmm, ce bun a fost!), dar am înlocuit, de mai bine de șapte luni, mâncarea nesănătoasă cu mâncare sănătoasă. Deci, în loc de carne și lactate de origine animală, avem o dietă bazată pe plante (fructe și legume, cereale integrale, semințe, nuci). Ce ingredient trebuie să mai adaugi ca să reușești? Că toată lumea ar reuși dacă ar fi atât de simplu, nu? Credința de sine. Să crezi în tine și în puterea ta, să te organizezi astfel încât să înregistrezi mici victorii care duc la mari transformări, în timp. De pildă, s-a demonstrat că oamenii care țin un jurnal alimentar zilnic își modifică singuri obiceiurile proaste și ajung să slăbească de două ori mai repede și mai mult decât cei care nu țin un astfel de jurnal, chiar dacă merg la nutriționist. Vă recomand cartea, vă poate schimba viața. "

Esistono luoghi dove le abitudini vengono deliberatamente studiate e altri dove invece si formano spontaneamente, spesso sulla rivalità e la paura.""Ogni mattina ti alzi; ti lavi e bevi un caffè. La solita strada per recarti al lavoro, le solite facce che riempiono le tue giornate.Detta così la nostra vita è di una tristezza incredibile ma la routine non solo ci dà sicurezza ma ci identifica.Charles Duhigg – giornalista del  New York Times  che vanta un premio Pulitzer per il giornalismo divulgativo- analizza il mondo delle abitudini, ossia, quei comportamenti automatici che dopo un periodo di prova diventano titolari del nostro quotidiano.Ma come nascono le abitudini e come funzionano? E, soprattutto, possono essere modificate? In che modo?Il saggio di Duhigg si compone di tre parti:1) Le abitudini degli individui2) Le abitudini delle organizzazionidi successo 3) Le abitudini delle societàUn'ultima parte consiste in una guida che esemplifica i passi da compiere per modificare un abitudine che si vuole abbandonare.Un testo molto interessante scritto con un linguaggio accessibile e che prende in esame differenti aspetti sociali in cui le abitudini sono manipolate in un senso o nell'altro.Si legge quindi dell'Anonima Alcolisti, l'Esercito, le multinazionali- come ad esempio la catena di caffetterie Starbucks o i centri commerciali statunitensi Target- fino ad arrivare ai movimenti dei diritti civili. Un filo sottile ma resistente, quello delle abitudini, che si tende tra realtà così differenti.Duhigg manda un messaggio preciso: bisogna prendere coscienza del fatto che le abitudini apparentemente ci dominano (in una sorta di dittatura) ma in realtà siamo noi ad avere il controllo.Il comportamento di routine è assolutamente malleabile, manipolabile e, pertanto, se si vuole si può scegliere la strada del cambiamento. Ogni capitolo ruota attorno a un argomento centrale: le abitudini si possono cambiare, se capiamo come funzionano. "

My favorite parts were the various stories and anecdotes the author provided for each lesson about habits. The book is fairly cohesive and my only complaint is that the 'how to use this book' section at the end is a bit too simple and doesn't encompass the ideas in every chapter (such as incorporating keystone habits, etc.). Nonetheless, definitely worth a read. I didn't get this book to try and change any of my habits, but still learned a ton. Here's what you need to know:1. Habits are controlled in your brain by the basal ganglia and happen subconsciously.2. The habit loop has 3 components: the cue, the action, the reward.3. To change a habit, you cannot change the cue or the reward, just substitute a different action for that cue that produces a similar reward.4. Things we do out of habit we are better at and do more dutifully than those we must think about.5. To get people to use your product, establish a habit loop."

50,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7407721-teguh,Rating 5 out of 5,"Membeli buku The Power of Habit ini, didasari oleh ketidaksengajaan. Suatu hari saya harus memeriksakan sepeda kesayangan saya ke dokter (red:bengkel). Seperti biasa, tanpa pernah berpikir panjang (ini, yang kemudian saya ketahui usai membaca buku ini, disebut HABIT. Karena saya melakukannya tanpa pernah berpikir dan menikmatinya), saya membawa buku. Saya ingat waktu itu saya bawa novel, hal ini karena bisa dipastikan sepeda saya akan check-up kesehatan agak lama. Pagi itu ada seorang perempuan, cantik, suaranya lembut. bibirnya sangat sensual dengan bulu-bulu tipis di atas bibirnya (mirip Iis Dahlia). Dia sedang membaca buku The Power of Habit. Dalam hati saya berkata, ""saya harus membaca buku ini. Habis ini saya akan mengecek reviewnya di Goodread."" Dan akhirnya seminggu kemudian saya memboyong buku ini dari rak toko buku. Permulaan kita bahas covernya dengan pilihan warna yang sangat nyaman, menurutku. Kuning salah satu warna kesukaan saya. Saya termasuk orang yang rewel dengan cover. Memang seharusnya kita membaca versi asli buku ini, karena pasti banyak informasi yang luar biasa kita dapatkan. Tetapi membaca terjemahannya pun tidak masalah. Karena penerjemah, 
Darmaning Tyas WulandariPalar
, mampu membuat buku ini enak dan nyaman dibaca. Dan FYI, ini adalah buku pengembangan diri (kalau boleh saya mengkategorikannya) yang habis kubaca setelah serial Malcolm Gladwell (
Blink, The Tipping Point, Outlier, dan What the Dog Saw
).Dalam buku ini Charles Duhigg ingin menyampaikan sebuah klausa bahwa kadang apa yang kita lakukan bukanlah keputusan kita secara sadar, atau dengan kata lain kita melakukan kegiatan sehari-hari tidak jarang di luar alam kesadaran kita. Misal apa yang kita lakukan sesaat setelah mata kita terbuka? Mengecek notifikasi BB? Minum air putih? Mencium pasangan kita? Atau justru berdoa dan lekas berbenah diri? Ternyata itu adalah KEBIASAAN kita. William James berkata di tahun 1892, Seluruh hidup kita, sejauh memiliki bentuk yang pasti, hanyalah sekumpulan kebiasaan (h.xv). Tetapi, sebenarnya bagaimana kebiasaan itu bisa muncul sedemikian tidak terasa?Untuk memahami bagaimana kebiasaan bisa bekerja seolah-seolah tanpa membutuhkan pertimbangan otak, Charles Duhigg, mengisahkan seorang pasien di rumah sakit bagian syaraf. Tahun 1993, Eugene Pauly (EP) kakek yang berusaia lebih setengah abad, tiba-tiba mengalami kerusakan bagian otak. Kerusakan ini membuat ia amnesia akut. Bahkan tidak mampu mengingat nama-anam anak dan cucunya. Tetapi ternyata setelah diamati berbulan-bulan tampak bahwa EP mampu berjalan-jalan sendiri keliling kompleks dan mampu tahu dimana ia harus pergi ketika perutnya terasa lapar, ketika ingin buang air. Padahal ketika diminta menggambar denah rumah, EP angkat tangan. Kok bisa?Disinilah kebiasaan bekerja. Ada memori yang bekerja tentang sebuah RUTINITAS ketika ada TANDA dalam fisik EP untuk mendapatkan GANJARAN. Inilah yang disebuag Charles sebagai lingkaran kebiasaan. Ketika perutnya lapar, otomatis tanpa perlu berpikir, EP akan berjalan menuju dapur, untuk mendapatkan ganjaran berupa perut kenyang. Ketidakbutuhan kerja otak dalam rutinitas dapat dilihat dalam percobaan yang merekam kerja otak tikus saat diletakkan dalam lorong berbentuk T dengan batangan cokelat ada di salah satu ujung. Kerja otak di awal-awal, cenderung datar dengan dosis yang tinggi. Tikus harus berpikir ketika pintu dibuka, ia harus mencari jalannya mana, ke kanan atau kiri. Tetapi lama kelamaan kerja otak makin turun. TIkus hanya berpikira pada saat pintu terbuka, dan saat mengudap cokelat. Sedang pergerakan mencari letak cokelat tikus tidak memerlukan porsi otak yang besar. So....Dan keberadaan lingkaran ini secara tidak langsung diterapkan Claude C Hopkins, seorang eksekutif muda Amerika, yang pada tahun 1900-an menerima tawaran seorang teman lama untuk memasarkan pasta gigi pepsodent. Masa itu kesehatan gigi orang amerika tidak menjadi perhatian penting pemerintah. Dan meski lingkaran kebiasaan belum marak masa itu, Hokins mampu menjual pepsodent selama tiga tahun hingga Spanyol, Jerman, dan Cina. Dan dalam satu dasawarsa pepsodent menjadi barang paling laris di dunia. Bagaimana Hokins membujuk orang Amerika yang semula tidak peduli terhadap kesehatan gigi mau memakai pasta gigi? Hopkin memakai tiga aturan lingkar kebiasaan tadi: TANDA-RUTINITAS-GANJARAN. Dalam bahasa Charles disebut sebagai otak mengidam. TANDA: gigi akan muncul lapisan kuning. RUTINITAS: Menggosok gigi dengan pepsodent. GANJARAN: gigi akan kembali putih.Dan dari lingkaran kebiasaan ini, kita mampu melakukan perubahan terhadap kebiasaan. Dengan tetap memertahankan TANDA dan GANJARAN. Namun mengubah RUTINITAS yang menjembatani antara TANDA dan GANJARAN. Wilson seorang pecandu alkohol akut, mampu menghentikan kecanduannya dan bahkan mampu mendirikan Alcoholics Anonymous, lembaga yang menangani para pecandu alkohol di Amerika. Karena para pecandu alkohol rata-rata tidak mengincar efek fisik dari minum alkohol saat minum banyak alkohol. Mereka hanya minum alkohol saat stres, tertekan, banyak masalah, dll (ini TANDA). Untuk mendapatkan ketenangan dan perasaan plong(ini GANJARAN). Maka rutinitas minum alkohol dapat diganti dengan rutinitas-rutinitas yang lain. Hal ini juga dapat diperlakukan pada kasus-kasus para pengidam nikotin, drugs, dll. Dan AA meyakini perubahan ini harus didasari pada kekuatan tekad, dan kekuatan tekad ini didasari atas kepercayaan atas sebuah kekuatan yang lebih tinggi. yaaa, itu adalah TUHAN dan AGAMA.Contoh lain adalah kasus Mandy, mahasiswa S2 yang memiliki kebiasaan menggigiti jari tangan hingga kuku-kukunya terlepas dan luka paras. TANDA: gorgi, kesepian, dan gelisah. RUTINITAS: menggigiti kuku. GANJARAN: perasaan tenang. Oleh dokter rutinitas diganti dengan, saat Mandy merasa gelisah tangan diusap-usapkan ke tangan dan memberi turus setiap kali merasa ingin menggigiti jari tangan. Dan ajaib, selama sebulan kebiasaan buruk itu lenyap dari Mandy.MEMBENTUK KEBIASAAN: menemukan tanda, dan ganjaran. Lalu menentukan rutinitas.MENGUBAH KEBIASAAN: mempertahankan tanda dan ganjaran, dengan mengubah rutinitas. Setelah berjalan lama, rutinitas baru akan menutup rutinitas lama dan menjadi kebiasaan baru.Great!!! Bagian pertama sudah memberi perombakan otak. Keren.Pada bagian kedua disebutkan beberapa orang yang mampu melakukan hal besar dengan mengubah kebiasaan. Kisah Paul O'Neil yang mampu meningkatkan laba perusahaan alumunium, Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) yang hampir sekarat. Dan Paul mampu menemukan kunci dengan mengubah kebiasaan kunci di perusahaan itu. Yaitu mengubah kebiasaan untuk meningkatkan keselamatan kerja pegawai. Hingga perubahan kunci itu mengubah semuanya, mulai dari gaya komunikasi antar pegawai hingga atasan dan budaya cepat tanggap ketika terjadi kecelakaan.Lalu ada kisah Starbuks yang di awal mulai menurun, karena karyawan yang loyo. Disini ada pengujian tekad. Ada pengaruh tekad terhadap kinerja Starbucks. Sebagai contoh anak-anak yang mampu menahan untuk memakan marsmallow 15' kemudian dan mendapat ganjaran dua buah marsmallow, ternyata di masa depan memilikikemampuan akademis lebih tinggi.Selain kedua itu, ada keberadaan krisis atau ancaman. Ternyata itu juga penting dijaga dalam sebuah ritme. Misal kejadian kebakaran di stasiun bawah tanah King's Cross ditengarai karena perusahaan tidak memperhitungkan kemungkinan negatif. Maka dalam pola pikir kita negative thinking juag dibutuhkan untuk kita semakin mawas diri.Lalu kecerdasan menganalisa target. Ada kisah perusahan marketing Target yang gagal menjajal teknik penjualan dengan mengincar para perempuan hamil karena salah prediksi. Lalu juga dikisahkan tentang bagaimana lagu ""Hey Ya!"" yang booming hanya karena selalu diselipkan dengan lagu-lagu yang menempel di telinga pendengar radio.Jadi, beberapa yang harus dicermati. Kita harus mampu menemukan kebiasaan kunci untuk mengubah semua kebiasaan besar. Lalu kita jaga kebulatan tekad. Tekad yang kuat juga harus diimbangi dengan kewaspadaan terhadap krisis yang kapan saja itu bisa muncul. Dan kecermatan memasang target, mampu membuat perusahaan atau kehidupan kita makin oye.Di bagian ketiga dikisahkan tentang kekuatan rutinitas dalam lingkungan kelompok. Yaitu, tentang kelompok orang kulit hitam yang mampu mengubah kisah pemisahan warna kulit di Amerika masa itu. Di bagian terakhir, Charles menjelaskan dua kasus yang bernada hampir sama namun memiliki perlakuan dan akibat yang berbeda. Kasus pertama adalah seorang ibu-ibu bernama Angie Bachman, yang berhutang sekian banyak dan dituntut sebuah bar tempat main kasino, karena utang main judi. Dia beranggapan bahwa kehendak main judinya tidak bisa dihentikan. Kasus kedua adalah seoarang suami, Brian Thomas yang membunuh istrinya saat tertidur (semacam ngelindur). Brian Thomas membela diri karena dilakukan tidak sadar, dan rasa dihantui perampok tidak bisa dikendalikan oleh nalarnya. Tetapi keduanya memiliki akibat yang berbeda. Thomas dibebaskan meski ia menghabisi nyawa orang yang tidak bersalah. Sedang Angie tetap dituntut oleh pihak kasino, padahal dia hanya bersalah pada dirinya sendiri dan pihak kasino tanpa menghilangkan nyawa. Tetapi ada alasan yang utama, yaitu Angie seharusnya mampu mengendalikan lebih kuat rasa ingin main kasinonya. Sedang Thomas benar-benar tidak akan pernah bisa mengendalikan, karena dilakukan dalam kondisi tidak sadarkan diri.di Bab ini juga Charles semacam memberi kesimpulan.Orang menjadi baik karena alam, ada pula yang berkata itu karena kebiasaan, sementara yang lain berkata otu karena perintah. (h.269)Kebiasaan yang secara sadar maupun tidak kita lakukan, baik yang besar maupun kecil, adalah proses membentuk kepribadian kita. Tetapi kata Charles, meskipun kebiasaan sudah tertanam di dalam benak kita, kebiasaan bukanlah takdir. Kita bisa memilih kebiasaan kita, dan kebiasan manapun bisa diubah,asalkan kita tahu bagaimana kebiasaa itu berfungsi(h.269)Dan satu bagian terpenting sebelum mengubah kebiasaan kita yang dirasa buruk, hal paling menguras tenaga adalah memutuskan untuk berubah, dalam islam ini disebut dengan niat. Itu merupakan kerja keras. Kehendak untuk percaya adalah bahan terpenting menciptakan kepercayaan untuk berubah. Dan bahwa satu metode terpenting untuk menciptakan kepercayaan adalah kebiasaan . (h.272)Sejatinya kebiasaan adalah hal-hal yang kita pilih. Dan anda pasti akan berubah, andai kepercayaan untuk berubah itu anda jadikan kebiasaan. Kita harus belajar dari fenomena alam, bahwa air melubangi sendiri saluran untuk dialiri, yang semakin lebar dan dalam; dan, setelah alirannya terhenti, ketika mengalir lagi, ditelusurinya kembali jalur yang ia telah buat sendiri.  (h.273) dan >b>tidak ada satu rumus untuk mengubah semua kebiasaan. Ada ribuan!! (h.274)Keren sekali bukunya....Thanks Charles Duhigg, your book is so damn good! Dan terimakasih untuk gadis di bengkel sepeda, yang membuatku membaca buku ini.Really love this book!!"

I didn’t feel inspired to review them as I would a fiction book, so instead I’m presenting non-fiction reviews as more notes and highlights of my favorite takeaways. It’s my way of journaling my experiences with the books so I have references for myself in the future. Here goes.. [4.5/5 stars] The Power of Habit is arguably the most well-written non-fiction book I’ve ever read. It’s a deftly woven exploration of habits through the use of case studies, engaging narrative, and individualistic habit implications. When I read James Clear’s Atomic Habits, I came away thinking, “great, I’m going to try to eat better… work out more, etc.,” but while reading Power of Habit it gave me some profound inspirations that I think I can use to help myself through some serious mental health stuff.. yeah, it’s that cool. There were more valuable takeaways from this book than indicated below, I just didn’t start taking notes until about the halfway point.Takeaways:It’s not about just cutting out a bad habit. It’s about finding something else to do in its place. The habit is the entire ritual of being compelled to do something through a trigger then following through for the payoff. If you want to stop eating cookies, don’t try to cold turkey your reach response for them when you’re hungry/stressed/whatever. Instead follow the habit perfectly but put a healthier alternative in the same spot as the cookies. <-Understanding the forces against change here has been super helpful.After reading the chapter on Target shopping analysts, I’m now much more concerned with how much data retail companies have on me than I am on what the government has. Our destruction will be orchestrated by Target statisticians lol.The Habit-Change Experiment:1. Identify the Routines (what are the cues and rewards?)2. Experiment with Rewards: change up random things to figure out which reward is driving the routines (the cafeteria/friends/cookie example).3. Identify the Cue. 1. Where are you? 2. What time is it? 3. What’s your emotional state? 4. Who else is around? 5. What action preceded the urge?4. Have a plan. Plan for the cue and chose a behavior that delivers the reward you are craving.Doing these diagnosis experiments helps you gain power over habits that can sometimes feel powerless to change.Overall rating: 4.5/5 stars. It was excellent.Thank you to my Patrons: Filipe, Dave, Frank, Sonja, Staci, Kat, Katrin, Melissa, and Derek! <3Via The Obsessive Bookseller at www.NikiHawkes.com"
52,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/110812-kinga,Rating 4 out of 5,"As far as self-help books go, this was surprisingly helpful and insightful. I read it in January, as you should, so perhaps this is why I’m still sticking to my NY resolutions. It inspired me to observe myself carefully and notice some of the things I do without realising. We learn that 40% of what we do every day follows established habitual patterns, which is a good thing because we can retrain ourselves to follow different patterns and make changes in our lives that don’t feel like they need insane amounts of self-discipline. On the other hand, this revelation made feel a little like I’m just a sophisticated automaton.My praise for this book isn’t unqualified. It does of course simplify things like most pop-psychology books do. While the concept of a habit loop – cue, routine, reward is a very useful way of thinking of our habits, it does gloss over a multitude of nuances that surround everything that we do as individuals, and as a society. I found that to be the case especially when the author gave examples of ‘keystone habits’ that cause domino effect – some of them just seemed far-fetched and could very well be the case of correlation, rather than causation. It was all just a little too neat at places. Of course Duhigg had to boil down an extensive area of study into easily digested soundbytes, which I am now boiling down further for the purposes of this review, so how am I to judge?This book was also full of repetitions, but one could argue that it just practices what it preaches. Only through repetitions we can retrain ourselves. Additionally, I listened to this on audiobook and I often zone out when listening to audiobooks, so the repetitions were most welcome. All in all, the ultimate message of this book is that of optimism. Even if you tried changing many times before and failed, the lasting success is still within your reach. I did cringe at some of the corporate case studies, especially the Starbucks puff piece. Seriously, if I read one more piece about how amazing Starbucks is to its baristas, I will conclude that their employees should actually be paying Starbucks for the privilege of working there. However, I did like the Febreze story because it’s just so ironic. They had a product which was great – it actually eliminated odours but they couldn’t sell it because smelly people with smelly houses generally didn’t realise they were smelly. So ironically, they had to invent a previously non-existent need for non-smelly people to use it. You gotta love capitalism. Also, I found the story behind Hey Ya! by Outkast fascinating. I hated that song and couldn’t understand why I was being hounded by it so relentlessly. I am happy to report that I still don’t like it, so whatever nonsense the record label tried to get me to like it, failed. And now, I decided, no company will ever trick me again! (ha, lol)."

Maybe the author should have started with his own story instead of finishing with it. It was kind of a letdown to find out that this book was his own self help project that we ultimately paid for. His wife thought he was getting fat and he realized that he was in the habit of eating a cookie at work every day. So that’s why the stories feel random. The goal of this book was for the author to lose eight pounds and get out of the habit of eating a cookie every day. Some of the stories are interesting but others just let me scratching my head wondering what am I supposed to get from that.

56,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"If you are looking for a how-to book, in the strict sense this isn't it. But if you want to change your habits you can glean how to do so from the main text, and Duhigg provides specific hints in an appendix. Duhigg does tell us how habits form without our awareness (every habit follows the pattern of cue-response-reward loops with cravings--expectations of the reward--thrown into the mix) and why they form (the brain's method of saving effort by turning any routine into an unthought habit) and where in the brain (the basal ganglia) they are stored. Simply put, changing habits begins with recognizing the pattern of a particular loop and then changing the response to the cue.In this well-researched and well-written book Duhigg talks to scientists about how rats memorize a maze. He describes how a man with extensive brain damage but whose basal ganglia is intact can still form new habits without recalling anything he does. He shows how real people with bad habits such as alcoholism can overcome them by changing the cue-response-reward loop; this is essentially how Alcoholics Anonymous works. Therapists train elderly patients to exercise after hip surgeries by manipulating the loop in such a way that the patients persist in exercising despite the pain instead of giving, greatly improving the quality of their lives. Duhigg describes Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps habitual routines that enabled him to win a race at the Chinese Olympics with his goggles filled with water, swimming virtually blind. He also explains how a social movement such as the civil rights movement depends on the same cue-response-reward loop.Corporation such as Target and the gambling industry exploit the loop to bring customers through the door and spend money without realizing that they are being manipulated.Fascinating and fun to read. The only caveat is that in the last chapter when Duhigg discusses the implications of habits on the issue of free will. There he too quickly judges that that we cannot be absolved from bad behavior due to irresistible habits in some cases while we are absolved of responsibility for our behavior in others. He may be right, but I wasn't convinced. "

59,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1242165-schmacko,Rating 3 out of 5,"Charles Duhigg has three fascinating half-books here. They’re all joined by the theme of habits. He speaks of habits from a personal perspective. Then he talks about business habits, switching from cognitive psychology to organizational psychology. And finally, he talks about sociology. What unifying pattern do these three have? That same old model I learned back in college in 1991… The idea of cues, actions, and rewards is throughout this book. It’s not very new nor very strong; in fact, Duhigg mentions that Claude Hopkins in his My Life in Advertising book first discussed this old, flimsy dusty model in 1927. So why does this book get 3 stars? Because Duhigg does find several fascinating stories about each section. He uses examples from AA attendees to overeaters to Target figuring out which person is pregnant and sending out the right kind of advertising without offending the person. This is some cool stuff, great fodder for cocktail conversations – scary in sort of a Big Brother way. (“We do not control ourselves!”)Duhigg could’ve made this book better, though. He says there isn’t enough research to say why some habits prevail and others are changeable. Why write a book then? Is this only a compendium of the most recent research? If it is, it misses some significant stuff. There are plenty of other sources he could’ve used as possible models. Malcolm Gladwell talks about how sociological influences because ubiquitous - social habit - in The Tipping Point (2000). Chip and Dan Heath talk about how to change when change is difficult in Switch (2007). I can also think of several other authors who’ve given more succinct processes to take the models and attempt to make them more useable. Duhigg seemed too scared to commit to some possibilities, some clear ways to influence the change of habit. He skirts it, and then he excuses himself, saying that habits are too multifaceted to offer possible models in detail.So his models are vague or old. He also doesn’t credit or discredit Gladwell or the Heaths or others who have had recent bestsellers talking about the same ideas. Then he writes three half-books that are barely bridged to each other. Still, his examples are good, and his style is infinitely readable. I would’ve liked to have him commit to some postulation that is more recent than Hopkins’ 1927 model. I also wish his bridge between the personal, organizational, and social was stronger."

61,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5193512-whitley-birks,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a review of an ARC received through a First Reads giveaway.For most of my adult life, I have struggled with bad habits that have kept me unemployed, ineffective when I was employed, unable to do the things that I want, and generally unhappy. About once a year I try and reinvent myself, and it'll work for a few days and then fail. Still, I have done quite a bit of research into habits and how to change them, and I've collected a lot of tidbits of information that float around in my brain.This book doesn't really impart any new information. If you're like me, however, it will give you what you know in a different way. This is not a self-help book. It will not give you platitudes or a list of steps on how to change or any promises of any kind. It does deliver a fascinating narrative on how our brains process habits and give context to the million bits of advice that can be picked up anywhere. It helps you understand the mechanics of what's going on, through case studies and vignettes, and brings it all together into a cohesive whole.I loved this book. It is probably the first thing I've picked up that has made me take an honest, detailed look at my life and make a plan on how to change it. I have no idea if I'll succeed or fail, as I have so many times before, but this is the first time I feel like I have more behind me than just some dottering, inexact advice.On a technical level, this is a moderately good book. The author does tend to mix his stories, starting one narrative and then leaving it hanging while he starts another, only to come back and finish the first. I'm annoyed by this style of writing, but the bits were still engaging enough that I kept through it. Then again, I was emotionally invested after the first chapter, so those that are reading for curiosity's sake may be more annoyed by it. Honestly, though? That's the only complaint I have with this book. It's a fast, entertaining, and fascinating read."

64,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,Rating 3 out of 5,"ReviewThe “Power of Habit” is a frustrating book to review. At its core, it presents ideas that are both interesting and practical: this book will - or at least might – change the way you think about, form, and conquer habits. At the same time, it’s flooded with same fuzzy and irrelevant “case studies” that pollute your average pop psychology book. The first part of this book nicely summarizes recent findings in the field of psychology concerning habits – how they form, how they function, and how they can – or can’t - be changed. This part of the book is, for the most part, rich in content and worthwhile. Duhigg summarizes legitimate findings, and there's more or less no bullshit.If only that could be said about the second part of the book, where fluff is piled high and irrelevance abounds. “The Power of Habit” is a prime example of an unfortunate recent trend in pop psych literature, where the author brings in “case studies” from business, history, and personal life to try and engage the reader and ostensibly make for more ‘interesting’ reading. Bullshit, I say: don’t waste my time.Duhigg’s “sample size of one” anecdotes are unconvincing and unnecessary. A CEO creates a “habit” of worker safety and increases revenue by X percent. So? How do we know there isn’t a CEO next door who tried to create similar habits, thereby driving his company into the ground? And what evidence is there that the proposed habit played any causal role whatsoever in our company’s eventual success, in light of the multitude of other changes that undoubtedly occurred at the same time? Correlation isn’t causation, Duhigg, and appealing to the evidence provided by a sample size of one, where the sample is obtained after the fact, no less (selection bias, anyone?), is dumb.To summarize: the first part of this book was fascinating – even if not exactly concise – and gets a solid 4 starts. The second part, on the other hand, is irrelevant and entirely unnecessary, and deserves no more than 2 stars. Thus, I’ll grudgingly average out my impression and give “The Power of Habit” a weak 3 stars. Maybe I’ve just read one too many pop psychology books. You might very well enjoy Duhigg’s long, detailed, and humanized case studies, but I came here to learn, and as far as content is concerned, “The Power of Habit” is a light contender indeed. SummaryDuhigg’s thesis is that habits function in a self-reinforcing, circular manner. He calls this cycle “the habit loop”: first, there’s a cue that tells your brain to go into “habit mode”; then, there’s a routine, which can by physical, mental, or emotional; and finally, there’s a reward , which tells your brain this particular loop is worth remembering for the future.The Role of CravingDuhigg explains that craving plays a central role in the habit loop. In essence, the brain responds to a cue by creating a craving for the expected reward, which prompts you to begin the intermediate routine. In one study, researchers sat a monkey in front of a monitor and taught it to pull a lever whenever a certain symbol flashed on a screen. If the monkey pulled the lever at the appropriate time, it was rewarded with a shot of blackberry juice from a nearby tube. The researchers monitored the monkey’s brain patterns throughout the experiment.At first, brain activity spiked in response to the reward: the monkey saw the symbol, pulled the lever, got the juice, and – wham! The brain monitor registered a rush of endorphins. Also, at this stage, if the researchers opened the door to the experimental room, the monkey decided it had had enough and immediately left to play.Soon, the action became a habit, and the researchers started to notice something interesting. While the actions of the monkey didn’t change, its brain activity did: as soon as the monkey saw the symbol – wham! The brain monitor registered a rush of endorphins. Only then would the monkey pull the lever and get the juice. In other words, the flashing shapes became a cue to pull the level, and this cue created a powerful craving for the presumed reward.And when the reward didn’t come –when the researchers withheld the blackberry juice or watered it down – the monkey became increasingly agitated and “frustration erupted inside its skull.” At this point, if the researchers opened the door from the room, the money no longer ran out to play. It stayed, glued to the monitor, waiting for its next hit of blackberry juice. Duhigg explains that this is why habits are so powerful: “they create neurological cravings.”Overcoming Existing HabitsFirst off, Duhigg explains that it’s incredibly difficult to overcome a habit – for all intents and purposes, we’ll call it impossible. Instead of trying to get ‘rid’ of a habit, aim to alter it slightly. Keep the old cue and deliver the old reward, but insert a new routine. Of course, to do this, you first need to identify the cue and isolate the reward.First, find out what cues the craving. Why do you habitually eat cookies at work? Does it happen when you’re bored? Does it occur at a certain time of day? This process of discovery is sometimes called “awareness training,” and it’s is the first step towards habit change.Once you’ve discovered the cue, isolate the reward. This can be tricky. For instance, in our cookie example, it might seem that the cookie itself is the reward. Duhigg disagrees: the cookie is the routine. The reward is the reason you eat the cookie. Perhaps you’re bored at work, and the cookie gives you something to do, as well as a pleasant energy boost; or maybe the cookie is a routine that allows you to socialize with your coworkers in the cafeteria; or maybe you’re just hungry. In any event, try to figure out why you eat the cookie.Once you’ve exposed the habit loop, insert a new routine. Do you eat the cookie out of boredom? Go on a walk instead. Do you really just want to socialize? Walk over to a co-workers desk instead. Are you just hungry? Grab an apple, then. The point is, cues don’t disappear, and cravings won’t just go away. “Habits are most malleable when the golden rule of habit change is applied: if we keep the same cue and the same reward, a new routine can be inserted.” Creating New HabitsFinally, how does one go about creating new, “good” habit? This time, we need to create a habit loop. To form a new habit, you have to first find a simple and obvious cue. Then, make to clearly define a definite reward. Finally, insert the desired routine. Before long, your brain will be ‘trained to crave’. For instance, studies show that people are “more likely to stick to a new workout plan if they choose a specific cue, such as running as soon as they get home from work, and a clear reward, such as a beer, or an evening of guilt-free television.”It also helps to envision and focus on your reward: the ""most successful dieters... envisioned a specific reward for sticking with their diet - a bikini they wanted to wear or the sense of pride they felt when they stepped on the scale - something they chose carefully and really wanted. They focused on the craving for that reward when temptations arose, cultivated the craving into a mild obsession. And their cravings for that reward.. crowded out the temptation.""Finally, examples of using rewards being to foster the formation of habits abound in the world of advertising. For instance, modern toothpaste includes mint oils that induce a cool, tingling sensation in your mouth, which you soon start to crave (try brushing your teeth with Toms ‘natural’ toothpaste, which doesn’t include the oils. It's... unsatisfying). Similarly, shampoo doesn’t have to foam, but the makers explicitly add foaming chemicals as a reward. Says one executive: “once the customer starts expecting the foam, the habit starts growing.”Forming “good” habits is hard, and altering existing “bad” ones is even harder. It's all easier said then done. But now you know – and in the words of the immortal G.I. Joes – knowing is half the battle."

The author successfully told us about the key concepts of habits in a creative way. In the book, there was one person who had a habit of sleepwalking. One time when he was sleepwalking, he killed his wife by accident. Suprisingly, he wasn't found guilty because lawyers argued that he couldn't control his habits. This was probably the part I found the most intriguing."

To say humans are creatures of habit is an understatement. Think of all the things you do on a daily basis without even thinking about them! Charles Duhigg has compiled so much information in this book. We've all heard the phrase: Old habits are hard to break, well there is a reason for that as we learn in this book, but also, there are ways to change your habits with a bit of insight into what makes them habits in the first place. It was a little shocking to learn about how corporations have used this information to help drive sales. A lot of interesting information throughout. "

At one point, we all consciously decided how much to eat and what to focus on when we got to the office, how often to have drink or when we go for a jog. Then we stop making a choice, and the behavior become automatic. It’s a natural consequence of our neurology. And by understanding how it happen, you can rebuild those pattern in whichever way you choose.”Buku ini Cerdas, Simple, dan Berguna!Cerdas: Salah satu hal yang unik yaitu 50 dari 383 halaman berupa sumber penelitian penulis, (yang tentunya tidak akan saya baca) se-ambisius itu kah penulisan buku ini?. Banyak hal yang bisa dipelajari dari buku ini. Terbagi dalam 3 bagian, bagian pertama, penulis mencoba meyakinkan betapa besarnya pengaruh Habit dalam hidup seseorang, bahkan saat bagian otak yang menyimpan memori dihilangkan, habit tetap bertahan. Dibuku ini juga dijelaskan bagaimana menggantikan habit yang buruk dan hal pertama yang harus dilakukan ialah dengan mengenal komponen habit itu sendiri. Terdapat 3 komponen Habit yaitu Cue, Routine dan Reward. “The process within our brains is a three step loop. First, there is Cue: A trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the Routine which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally there is reward which help your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering.”Buku ini bahkan memberikan contoh nyata misalnya Habit buruk kita adalah ngemil di sore hari yang mempengaruhi berat badan kita. Cuenya bisa saja karena waktu sore hari kita merasa lelah dan ingin melakukan hal lain, maka cuenya adalah sore hari, kemudian hal rutin yang kita lakukan adalah ngemil dan pada akhirnya rewardnya kita merasa tenang dan rileks. Tapi sebenanrnya apa yang kita inginkan? Apakah kita benar-benar lapar atau hanya ingin rileks sejenak, jika hanya ingin rileks maka kita bisa menggantikannya dengan Habit berjalan-jalan atau kesenangan lain untuk menggantikan Habit buruk tadi. Yang berganti hanya routinenya saja, cuenya tetap sore hari dan rewardnya tetap perasaan rileks. Mungkin hal ini akan berbeda-beda untuk tiap orang tapi buku ini mengajarkan saya untuk lebih banyak menganalisis diri saya sendiri, bahkan diakhir buku penulis menyimpulkan kembali dan memberikan langkah-langkah yang jelas.  “to change a habit you must keep the old cue and deliver the old reward but insert the new reward”Bagian kedua buku akan lebih membahas pengaruh habit dalam lingkungan yang lebih besar, Paul O’Neill melakukannya dalam bidang industri aluminium hanya dengan mengubah habit dari hal yang mendasar yaitu masalah safety, Rhode Island Hospital memelihara habit dimana dokter dan perawat yang tidak akur pada akhirnya membawa dampak mengerikan: Salah bor, ya sang Dokter melubangi kepala pasien disisi yang salah jadi sisi dimana penyakitnya berada harus dilubangi lagi -___-Bagian ketiga buku lebih membahas Habit dalam lingkup sosial, bagaimana Marthen Luther King Jr. memperoleh kebebasan masyarakat kulit hitam, juga bagaimana Rick Warren membangun anggota gerejanya. Hal lain yang juga menarik yaitu kasus seorang ibu (Angie Bachman) yang bangkrut dan terlilit utang karena gila judi dinyatakan bersalah di pengadilan sementara seorang suami (Thomas) yang membunuh istrinya saat sleepwalking dinyatakan tidak bersalah, padahal keduanya memiliki kesamaan yaitu mereka tidak bisa mengendalikan habit buruk mereka.Simple:Kata-kata yang digunakan mudah dimengerti. Penulis meyakinkan kita pada hal yang ia tulis dengan menceritakan kisah tokoh disertai dengan penelitian yang dilakukan yang secara mengejutkan tidak berat. Jika punya uang lebih sebaiknya baca yang versi asli. Berguna:Saya terprovokasi untuk mencoba menerapkan pada proyek Bad Habit saya, beberapa diantaranya:1. Tidak fokus, hal ini sering terjadi pada saya jika ada hal yang lebih menarik buat saya maka saya seakan lupa pelajaran dan kuliah saya. 2. Menghabiskan waktu dengan TV series (Suits, Scream Queen, Bones, Sleepy Hollow, fargo) wah rasanya liburan saya sangat tidak produktif wkwk3. melewatkan Sarapan Pagi, hmm sepertinya sarapan itu penting..Buku ini saya rekomendasikan buat teman teman yang punya kebiasaan-kebiasaan buruk atau ingin menerapkan kebiasaan-kebiasaan yang baik. “Changing Some Habit can be more difficult. Sometimes Change takes a long time. Sometimes it requires repeated experiments and failures. But once you understand how a habit operates- once you diagnose the cue, the routine ant the reward – you gain power over it” – Charles Duhigg. "
71,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1182891-sue,Rating 3 out of 5,"The title of this book may be misleading if you want to lose weight, stop procrastinating, or get to appointments on time. It would be easy to think you’d found a self-help book. Okay, maybe it could help a reader break an unwanted habit. Duhigg does try to analyze those behaviors. There are a few good stories of people who quit smoking or started exercising. But it is more accurately about patterns of behavior in groups as well as individuals: in corporations, the military, and the marketplace. I had never thought of corporations instilling habits, but we hear all the time about corporate culture, and that is an amalgam of habitual behaviors. This book is broadly organized around the concept of habits (with a number of fun stories) and around the endlessly entertaining custom (habit?) of observing human nature.Duhigg told the following story, which he claims hooked him on the subject of habits. An army officer in Iraq observed that violence in the small town where he was stationed occurred in a particular plaza. People gathered, food vendors arrived, then someone would throw a rock or bottle. He asked the town’s mayor one evening to keep the food vendors away. The crowd showed up, got restless and hungry, and eventually left – defused – because the street vendors were absent. Duhigg, then a reporter in Baghdad, asked the officer how he had analyzed this situation. The US military, the officer said, is an experiment in habit formation. “Understanding habits is the most important thing I’ve learned in the army.” This story did not initially meet my usual understanding of what constitutes a habit. But the habit of a kebab dinner supported the assembling of a large and restless crowd. At least for the duration of this book, I broadened my definition of a habit.But in case you really crave the self-help part of this book, here is Duhigg’s description of personal habit formation: A cue triggers a routine, which is the behavior you may want to change. There’s a reward inherent in that routine. Figure out what reward you really want, then change the routine to get it. The cue (an emotion, a time of day) will still be present, but you’ll respond with a different routine.Corporations make appearances in a couple of ways. The story of Paul O’Neill at Alcoa is one in which he sought to transform a poorly performing company by instilling a culture of safety. Employees were led to respond to dangerous situations with ingrained safety procedures. In other words, they learned new habits of response. Altering one important habit of all employees, in a highly disciplined manner, changed the culture of the corporation.But corporations also want to know about customer habits. If you shop at Target, consider yourself warned. The store knows more about you than you can possibly imagine. Uncomfortable territory. Your habits are known!"
72,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1166663-carol,Rating 3 out of 5,"A new year always seems like a good time to think about the things we'd like to change about ourselves. Just how we're going to do this is not always clear. My goal at the beginning of 2014 was to change some eating habits that were once again getting away from me. After listening to Michael Kindness interview with Charles Duhigg on Books On The Nightstand I decided it might just be the right time to pick this up.In the beginning pages Duhigg explains just what habit is. ""Scientists say they emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort. Left it its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any routine into a have, because habits allow our minds to ramp down more often.""The author admits right up front that there is no manual for all and that it isn't always easy to change a habit. Duhigg does not at anytime condone breaking a bad habit, he suggests that habits can be reshaped. If you take a simple message from this book it is that a habit is ""a loop that consists of three parts: a cue, a routine and a reward"". Duhigg maintains the reformation of the habit requires you to change the routine. Routines that feel good are hard to change. ""Tomorrow, you'' muster the willpower to resist. Tomorrow will be different. But tomorrow the habit takes hold again."" You need to examine this habit loop and the behavior you want to change. The subtitle of The Power of Habit"" Why we do what we do in Life and Business alludes to this being not only a personal look at habit but how habit can be changed in business. Much of the book deals with this aspect but the principles explained can easily be applied to changing habits in everyday life. If the business model of habit or the habits of societies do not interest you, this may not be the right book but if you can see how the mindset is changed, I think you'll find value here.Did I reform my eating habits? Not quite but I am at least empowered to examine them and have done some tweaking of routine and will seek new rewards. It can't hurt to have more understanding in a look at oneself. "
73,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9281934-louise,Rating 2 out of 5,"Charles Duhigg's premise is that habits are formed when behaviors are rewarded. Because the brain is wired to anticipate a reward it directs behavior towards getting the reward. The author presents some studies that show brain activity in the anticipation and reward cycles. He poses a ""golden Rule"" of habit change which is to identify the cue that anticipates the reward and find an alternative route to that reward. He cites AA, group/team and religious experiences to show that for habits to stick, belief is needed.After describing the thesis the author elaborates on it drawing rather narrow conclusions from research and case studies.Habit is the only explanation given for a study showing the later success of young kids who could wait for two cookies rather than eat one right away. It would seem that perception of time or visions of the future should be factors. Regarding the ""cookie"" and ""radish"" groups in another experiment, can habit really developed in such a short period of time, or was the result about cynicism or a merely an energy rush from sugar? ... and so it goes.While breaking habits is undoubtedly part of change, Duhigg sees his theory everywhere. He writes as though breaking habits is the only cause of complex organizational change at Alcoa. He attributes marketing success (Pepsodent, Target and creating hit records) to catering to habits, sports victories (the Buccaneers) to ignoring plays and building physical habits and the civil rights movement (the Selma bus boycott) to the habits of association. Each of these cases is comprised of many factors and teasing out the influence of habit would be a difficult to impossible task.Other sections cover memory loss, gambling habits, the Saddleback Church. While the descriptive writing easy to read, each has many issues embedded besides ""habit"".The value of the book is in the first part where the thesis is described and in the Appendix where how to use the thesis is clearly written."

Personal habits, corporate habits and societal habits.Everything was presented in easy to digest segments, anecdotes and examples but I have to say after the first few times showing the “habit loop” to readers it started grating on my nerves. Yes, I got ittttt the first 10 times no need to bash me over the head with the slightly amateurish graphics.The chapters I found most interesting focused on corporate habits or changes in how they do business. Examples included Target’s algorithms to predict what people want before they even know they want it. The Starbucks turnaround and how song hits are predicted and presented by DJ’s.I also found the chapter on court cases involving compulsive gambling and murders under the influence of sleep walking interesting. And of course the section on Rosa Parks and why her act of defiance was the tipping point in civil rights in 1955.So overall this was a fairly interesting in-between read when you only have a few minutes here and there."

The book is divided into three parts, examining the habits of individuals, organizations, and societies. I found the first part on the habits of individuals to be the most engaging and insightful. Duhigg is a great writer and slowly leads the reader to his conclusions with fascinating stories and experiments. While his conclusions aren't revolutionary (but are rather straightforward if you have spend some time thinking about this on your own), it was still engrossing to see it all laid out in written form.I found part two and three on the habits of organizations and societies to be less compelling. At times, it feels like Duhigg really stretched hard to tie the stories he's telling into the themes of those sections. Some of his conclusions feel very hand-wavy, as if he fit the facts around a predetermined conclusion instead of the other way around. And he left out a lot of the complexities and nuances that contributed to why and how things happened the way they did, which came across as over-simplifications of the real world."

Finding the cues and changing the routine to get rewarded - a single topic has been experimented in worldwide renowned labs depicts the importance of issue (if you thinking it's not worthy to read about it.) 5 stars for this one. 5th star for covering the complex topic in simple words so it'd not stuck to few brilliant minds but penetrate to the masses n convey the message.

79,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6084665-aljazi-al-maghlouth,Rating 5 out of 5,كتاب “ قوة العادة - The Power of HABIT” من أفضل الكتب التي قرأتها تشرح مفاهيم طالما كنت أتسائل وألاحظها ولا أجد لها تفسير. الكتاب بشكل عام يشرح كيف ننتصرف وما هو الدافع لتصرفاتنا، وأننا منذ أن نستيقظ من النوم، وحتى ينتهي اليوم بأكمله نسير بحلقات من العادات المتأصلة في أدمغتنا والتي نطبقها بلا تفكير واعي، إذا كنت تستيقظ وفورٍا توضب سريرك أو تتفقد هاتفك ثم تفرش أسنانك، تحضر ملابسك وترتديها، تنزل من الدرج، ترتدي حذائك.. هل ارتديت الفردة اليمنى قبل اليسرى أم العكس؟ وأنت تقود سيارتك إلى العمل وتقوم بأنشطة مألوفه هل تبذل جهد دماغي واعي للتفكير بكل خطوة تخطوها؟ وآنت تعد شطيرتك هل تفكر بكل جزء تقوم به وبكل لمسة تلمسها؟ بالمؤكد لا .. هذه العادات من جراء التكرار تبنى في اللاوعي وتتأصل في منطقة داخلية في الدماغ تدعى العقدة القاعدية - basal gnglia- هذه المنطقة تتبنى كل هذه الانشطة التي نفعلها بلا ادراك وبمهارة ومن غير تفكير مسبق لذا هي تلعب دور في تفعيل هذه العادات مثل تفعيل الوظائف اللا ارادية في جسم الإنسان التي لا شأن لنا بها كالتنفس وتنظيم معدل ظربات القلب. للتوضيح أكثر: روى الكاتب قصة رجل اشتهرت في الملفات الطبية يدعى “ أيقن بولي”، والذي بسبب مرض معين فقد ذاكرته قصيرة الأمد كليٍا، فلم يعد يتذكر أسماء الأشخاص، وبات يكرر نفس الكلام بنفس الجمل في نفس الدقيقة عدة مرات لأنه لا يستوعب أو بالأحرى لا يتذكر أنه قد قالها بالفعل، يقوم بعمل نفس الفعل عدة مرات في نفس الساعة مثل أن يحضر وجبة الإفطار التي تتكون من البيض والسجق أكثر من ستة مرات صعودٍا ونزولا إلى المطبخ، يقرآ الصحيفة ويشاهد قناة تاريخيه في التلفاز طوال الوقت.وخوفًا على صحته طلب الأطباء من زوجته أن تصطحبه كل يوم في نزهه خارج المنزل، وبمرافقته حتى لا يضيع، ولأن النشاط الرياضي مفيد لصحته. وفي يوم من الأيام تأخرت زوجته عن أصطحابه ورجعت لتتفقده فوجدته أختفى، لم يكن موجوداً بالمنزل ولا في الحديقة، بحثت عنه في الشارع وسألت عنه الجيران واتصلت بالشرطة لأنها تعلم أنه كشخص فاقد للذاكرة لا يدل طريق العودة ان خرج ولم يعد وقد يؤدي ذلك إلي عواقب وخيمة، ولما عادت الى المنزل كانت المفاجئة وجدته مستلقي يشاهد قناته التاريخيه! فكيف يا ترى أستطاع بلا ذاكرة كليًا ان يعود إلى المنزل وان يعرف الطريق وفي نفس الوقت تحديدًا ؟ وفي موقف آخر طلب منه الباحثون ان يرسم خريطة لمنزله فلم يفعل، مع ذلك أستطاع ان يستأذن ويتجه إلى دورة المياه بلا مساعدة، ويستطيع أن يتجه إلى غرفة النوم والمطبخ ويقلي البيض ويقوم بكل عاداته ولكن لا يستطيع تفسيرها أو رسمها. فكيف لشخص فاقد لمركز الذاكرة وتحديدا الذاكرة قصيرة الأمد أن يتذكر؟ .. لتفسير ذلك قام الباحثون في معهد MIT بتصميم تجربه، آحضروا فئران وقاموا بإنتزاع مراكز الذاكرة في أدمغتها، ثم وضعوا فأر في بداية متهاهة على شكل حرف T وأغلقوا عليه بحاجز مضيء، ووضعوا في الرآس الأيسر من المتاههة قطعة من الشوكولاتة، كان يجب على الفأر بعد إزالة الحاجز أن يصل إلى قطعة الشوكولاته التي تقع في نهاية المتاهة على اليسار، وفي أثناء ذلك يقوم الباحثون بتسجيل النشاطات الدماغية للفأر، حينما يزال الحاجز، وحينما يعبر الفأر المسار المستقيم وحينما يتلفت إلى اليمين وإلى اليسار. فوجودا آن الفأر يبذل نشاط دماغي واعي عالي جدًا في كل مراحل المتاههة، وقاموا بتكرار التجربة كل يوم على نفس الفئران، في اليوم ٢٧ أنخفض النشاط الدماغي بشكل ملحوظ للفئران حينما عبروا الجزء المستقيم من المتاهة، وفي اليوم اليوم ٣٦ أنخفض النشاط الدماغي للفئران في جميع أجزاد الماهة حتى أنهم لم يتلفتوا لجهة اليمين بل ركضوا سريعًا إلى قطعة الشوكولاته حتى لم يعد هنالك أي نشاط دماغي.. فكيف أستطاعت الفئران أن تحفظ طريق المتاهة إذا لم تكن تمتلك ذاكرة وذاكرتها أُزيلت جراحيًا منذ البداية ؟ .. التفسير الذي توصل إليه الباحثون أنه ليس بالحفظ بل بالتكرار تم تخزين ذلك النشاط في منطقة العقدة القاعدية في الدماغ وهي المسؤلة عن جميع التصرفات اللا إرادية التي يقوم بها الجسم بلا نشاط دماغي وتفكير واعي مسبق مثلها مثل تنظيم جريان الدم ومثل رفع وخفض درجة الحرارة. لذلك إستطاع “أيقن بولي” أن يدل طريق العودة لمنزله وأن يطهي البيض مع السجق كما اعتاد طيلة حياته حتى ولم يتذكر مسميات ما بين يديه، أيضا تلك العادات تمر بمرحله حلقيه من إشارة ثم روتين ثم مكافئة ففي تجربة الفئران كانت الإشارة هي إزالة الحاجز والروتين هو العبور والمكافئة هي قطعة الشوكولاته. إما في حالة “أيقن فكانت هنالك إشارات أيضا مثل إضاءة المطبخ التي تخبره أنه وقت الصباح لذلك طالما كانت الإضاءة أو الشمس موجودة فهو يقوم بالروتين الذي هو طهي البيض ثم يحصل على المكافئة التي هي أكله. جميع العادات التي نقوم بها تبدأ من الأشارة التي تجري تأثيرًا عصبيًا يسبب الشهية وقد تتنوع هذه الإشارات دعاية على التلفاز، لوحة إعلان لمطعم، قطع من الكوكيز، وقت من اليوم، أشخاص أو مجموعة من الأفكار. وبالوقت الذي نحدد فيه تلك الإشارات نكون أكثر قابلية لفهم عاداتنا والبدأ في تغييرها، وعلينا أن نعرف أن هذه العادات ليس من السهل تغييرها لأنها متأصلة فينا مثلا : كم مرة وضعت خطة لإنقاص وزنك ولم تتبعها لأنك لم تتوقف عن الإستجابة لتلك المثيرات الموجودة من حولك من السكاكر والكعك والبطاطا المقلية ، او لم تلتزم بالخطة حتى؟ كم مرة قررت فيها أنك ستبدآ بممارسة التمارين الرياضية فور عودتك من الدوام ولكنك بالمقابل وجدت نفسك تتكأ لتقرأ تغريدات على تويتر وتدردش بالواتس اب، ان السلوكيات البسيطة هذه تعتبر عادات وهي وان كانت صغيرة فهي إدمانيه. كم مرة قررت أنك في هذا الفصل الدراسي “ بتشد حيلك وتجيب درجات عالي” لكن لم يحصل ذلك ؟ لأنك لم توجد أو تغير روتين عاداتك اليوميه .. لتغير أي عادة يجب أن تستبدلها بعادة جديدة وأن توجد لها إشارة واضحة مثل أن تضع سجادة الصلاة في مكان واضح بالغرفة إذا كان هدفك المحافظة على الصلوات في أوقاتها. الجزء الأول وضع تعريفًا للعادة وهي حلقة من : إشارة —روتين — مكافئة . وكل مكافئة تشعل شعور بالجوع للتقدم بذلك الفعل وعدم تركه، وأن أفعالنا تصبح عادات متى ما توقفنا عن التفكير عنها بوعي وعقلانية. المكافئة يجب أن تكون واضحة للإستمرار بالعادة ولذلك يستخدم مروجوا الإعلانات والمنتجون مكافئات لذيذة لنا. أقرب مثال طرحه الكاتب هو معجون الأسنان، فمعجون الأسنان من المفترض أن لا يحتوي على رائحة ولا رغوة ولا يمنح شعور الإنتعاش وكل تلك الرغوات والنكهات ليست إلى زينة لا تضيف لمفعول معجون الأسنان نفسه، ولكن المنتجون يريدون أن نشعر بالمكافئة لنستلذ بها ونستمر فيضيفونها، والإشارة لإستخدامها قد تكون إشارة زمنيه م��ل إستخدامه على طول في الصباح أو بعد شعورك أن اسنانك متسخه وغير منتعشة لذلك انت تشتهي شعور الانتعاش حتى بلا وعي. بمجرد أن تعتاد على المكافئة تصبح مستاءً جدًا عدما لا تحصل عليها. /Users/Aljazimag/Desktop/Unknown.jpegالجزء الأول أيضٍا وضع قواعد للتخلص من أي عادة ومن المستحسن القول ن هنالك عادات صعب التخلص منها مثل ادمان الكحول، وعادات سهلة، وبتعريف الإشارة والروتين وستبدالهم والتعود على ذلك نستطيع تغييرها. جميعنا يعرف أن التغير ممكن والتغير يبدأ من الذات : إن الله لا يغير مافي قوم حتى يغيروا مافي أنفسهم.من التجارب المؤثرة بي والتي كتب عنها الكاتب وقرأتها مرارًا في عدة كتب أخرى هي تجربة تأثير “حلوى المارشيميلو”: حلّلت هذه التجربة قدرة أطفال في سن الرابعة على التصدي للرغبة في سبيل هدف أهم منه، أي التصدي للإشارة. وذلك بالطريقة التالية: تم إحضار كل طفل إلى الغرفة وأجلسوهم أمام طاولة عليها مارشيميلو. أخبر العلماء الأطفال أن بإمكانهم تناول الحلوى الآن، أو يمكنهم  الحصول على قطعتي حلوى لو انتظروا ١٥ دقيقة إضافية.جميع الأطفال أرادوا الانتظار في البداية. لكن كثيراً منهم لم يقاموا، انهارت سيطرتهم بعد دقائق قليلة وبدأ بعضهم فعلًا بآكل المارشيميلو. وبعض الصغار صبر إلى حتى انتهت ١٥ دقيقة كاملةً وفي تلك الأثناء قاموا بتصرافات جعلتهم يشغلون أنفسهم بالتفكير عن الحلوى، فغنى بعضهم أناشيدا وبعضهم وقام البعض بتغطية أعنهم متظاهرين بلعب الغميمة. في وقتٍ لاحق بعد سنين طويلة، قام الباحثون بمراقبتهم طيلة مراحل حياتهم، في المرحلة الثانوية، اتضح أن الأطفال الذين أظهروا مزيداً من التحكم في الذات والذين تصدوا لعاداتهم وللإشارات المغرية، تصرفوا على نحو أفضل وكانوا خلال حياتهم أقل عرضة للإدمان وقد سجلوا درجات أعلى في اختبار التقييم المدرسيSAT. ليس من الصعب أن نرى كيف يمكن للتصدي للمغريات والتحكم بالذات أن ينبئ بالنجاح في بعض المجالات. التحكم في الذات يعني استبدال متعة قصيرة الأجل بأهداف طويلة الأجل، أن تتجاهل رغبة مشاهدة فيلم وتعمل على كتابة روايتك بدلاً من ذلك.يمكن أن نرى التحكم بالذات عند من يقرر ممارسة الرياضة أو عدم ممارستها. كلما أبديت تصديًا أقوى للإشارات ولعاداتك السلبية ولم تنجرف لها كلما أبليت حسنًا في جميع نواحي حياتك لأنك وبكل بساطة تمتلك القدرة على التحكم في ذاتك، واعي بكل ما تفعله ولما تفعله ولست منجرفًا وراء التيار.. “كلما غيرت عادة أصبح تغير عادات أخرى أكثر سهولة” خذ مثلًا ممارسة الرياضة وما يتبعها من الت،قف عن التدخين وتناول الطعام الصحي.. تحدث الكتاب عن العادات في الشركات وأعطى أمثلة وقصص لشركات كبيرة غيرها أشخاص من بينها “ستاربكس”، كذلك العادات في المجتمعات. بالنهاية.. أود أختم بإقتباس من الكتاب: متى ما أخترت ما تريد أن تكونه، آمن بأن التغير ممكن، ثم سيصبح حقيقة

But after a few days of running the same route… the decision-making centers of the brain went quiet. All it had to do was recall the quickest path… In a new weeks the rat had internalized how to sprint the maze to such a degree that it hardly needed to think at all… the brain worked less and less.”“Habits emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort. Left to its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any routine into a habit.”Anatomy of a Habit Loop :1. Cue - trigger tells you to go into automatic mode2. Routine - can be physical, mental, or emotional3. Reward - helps you figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future“When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in something.”“Every McDonald’s looks the same. The company deliberately tries to standardize store architecture and what employees say… everything is a consistent cue to trigger purchasing routines. ”“… Foods at some chains are specifically engineered to deliver immediate rewards. The fries are designed to begin disintegrating the moment they hit your tongue, in order to deliver a hit of salt and grease as soon as possible.""“The brain has an amazing ability to find happiness, even when the memories of it are gone.”“Craving is what makes cues and rewards work, and powers the habit loop.”""Most food sellers locate their kiosks in food courts. But Cinnabon tries to locate their stores away from other food stalls. Why? Because Cinnabon executives want the smell of Cinnabon rolls to waft down hallways uninterrupted.” “There are thousands of hours of videotape showing shoppers turning right once they clear the front doors. As a result of this tendency, retailers fill the right side of the stores with the most profitable products they’re hoping you’ll buy right off the bat.” “They looked for shoppers with shopping lists. Despite those lists, more than 50% of purchasing decisions occurred the moment a customer saw a product. Despite shoppers’ best intentions, their habits were stronger than their written intentions.”“Consumers act like creatures of habit, automatically repeating past behavior with little regard to current goals.”“Pregnant women are goldmines… In 580 hospitals, new mothers get gifts from the Walt Disney Company, which in 2010 started a division specifically aimed at marketing to the parents of infants.”“To market a new habit - be it groceries or aerobics - you must understand how to make the novel seem familiar.”“Harris Entertainment Industry was known throughout the gaming industry for its sophisticated tracking systems… predictive algorithms that studied gamblers’ habits… so precise, they could track a gamblers’ spending to the cent and minute.” “Slot-machines have been reprogrammed to deliver a more constant supply of near-wins… Gamblers who keep betting after near-wins are what make casinos, race tracks, and state lotteries so profitable.”“Pathological gamblers got more excited about winning… even though they didn’t actually win any money… The near-miss triggers habits that prompt them to put down another bet” “Said a state lottery consultant…'You want to know why sales have exploded? Every other scratch-off ticket is designed to make you feel like you almost won.’ ""“All of us are simply a bundle of habits.”“For organizations to work, leaders must cultivate habits that create a real and balanced peace, and paradoxically, make it absolutely clear who’s in charge.”“Starbucks taught their employees how to handle moments of adversity by giving them willpower habit loops… Managers drilled employees, role-playing with them until the responses became automatic.” “This is how willpower becomes a habit: by choosing a certain behavior ahead of time, and then following that routine when an inflection point arrives.”“Habits aren’t destiny. We can choose our habits… if you understand how they function.”“Small winds are steady applications of a small advantage. Small winds fuel transformative changes by leveraging tiny advantages into patterns that convince people that bigger achievements are within reach.”“To modify a habit, you must decide to change it. You must consciously accept the hard work of identifying the cues and rewards that drive the habits’ routines and find alternatives. You must know you have control and be self-conscious enough to use it.”“Once you realize habits can be rebuilt… the only option left is to get to work.”"
81,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76507338-saadia-b,Rating 4 out of 5,"By focusing on one pattern - what is known as a 'keystone habit' - we can teach ourselves to reprogram the other routines in our lives. Most of the choices we make each day may feel like the products of well-considered decision making but they're not. They're habits. And though each habit means relatively little on its own, over time, the meals we order, what we say to our kids each night, whether we save or spend, how often we exercise and the way we organize our thoughts and work routines have enormous impacts on our health, productivity, financial security and happiness. This process in which the brain connects a sequence of actions into an automatic routine is known as 'chunking' and it's at the root of how habits form. Habits, scientist say emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort. Left to its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any routine into a habit, because habit allows our minds to ramp down more often. This effort-saving instinct is a huge advantage. An efficient brain requires less room and also allows us to stop thinking constantly about basic behaviors such as walking and choosing what to eat, so we can devote mental energy to inventing spears, irrigation systems and eventually airplanes and video games. Our brain follows a three-step loop. First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine, which can be physical, mental or emotional. Finally there is a reward which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future. Habits never really disappear. They're encoded into the structures of our brain. The two basic rules: 1) Find a simple and obvious cue 2) Clearly define the rewardsCraving is an essential part of the formula for creating new habits. For habits to permanently change, people must believe that change is feasible. Belief is easier when it occurs within a community. The habits that matter most are the ones that when they start to shift, dislodge and remake other patterns. Small wins fuel transformative changes by leveraging tiny advantages into patterns that convince people that bigger achievements are within reach. If you dress a new something in old habits, it's easier for the public to accept it. Peer pressure - and the social habits that encourage people to conform to group expectations - is difficult to describe because it often differs in form and expression from person to person.The habits of peer pressure however have something in common. They often spread through weak ties and they gain their authority through communal expectations. If you ignore the social obligations of your neighborhood, if you shrug off the expected patterns of your community, you risk losing your social standing. You endanger your access to many of the social benefits that come from joining the country club, the alumni association or the church in the first place. Such peer pressure on its own isn't enough to sustain a movement. But when the strong ties of friendship and the weak ties of peer pressure merge, they create incredible momentum. That's when widespread social change can begin.Some habits are so powerful that they overwhelm our capacity to make choices and thus we're not responsible for what we do. Hundred of habits influence our days they guide how we get dressed in the morning, talk to our kids, and fall asleep at night; they impact what we eat for lunch, how we do business and whether we exercise or not. Each of them has a different cue and offers a unique reward. Every habit, no matter its complexity is malleable. To modify a habit you must decide to change it. You must consciously accept the hard work of identifying the cues and rewards that drive the habits' routines and find alternatives. The reason why it is so hard to identify the cues that trigger our habits is because there is too much information bombarding us as our behaviors unfold. A habit is a choice that we deliberately make at some point and then stop thinking about, but continue doing often everyday. Blog | YouTube  | Instagram | Facebook | LinkedIn"
82,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5924440-girish,Rating 5 out of 5,"More than 40% of the actions people performed each day weren't actual decisions, but habits This book has long been on my toread and with good reason. Charles Duhigg's Power of Habit is a must read for those who have either tried to cultivate good habits or transform organisations or puzzled over inexplicable happenings in the newspaper. I am an inside out person and I was able to apply most of what I was reading to my day to day life and what I see in the organizations that I work with. It even explained to me some of the puzzling outcomes such as the Marina protest for Jallikattu or why Harris Jayaraj songs are more catchy than AR Rahman's. Narrated only in anecdotes and case-lets, the book is a surprisingly easy read. Starting with the basic Habit loop, the books goes onto explore keystone habits, organizational transformation, social movements, the power of crises, gambling and the other side of habits. After all the fun stuff is a handbook on how to use the learning from the book.On introspection, there were so many reflections from your day to day life, that it seized to be a simple book. I personally loved the chapters on P&G Febreze case, the Alcoa transformation, Radio station habit manipulation, Starbucks customer service and the African American movement in America. If you notice a wide variety of things in the book, they are brought together almost seamlessly that your learning happens before you realize it.A definite recommended read in non-fiction, if ever there was one!

I’ve been avoiding self-help books for some time, probably because I’m at a point where I find them annoying and a bit boring. I’d rather escape into some good fiction any day! I thought that this book would be yet another self-help book and so I’d been reluctant to read it for a while. I was wrong. It’s not a self-help book and it doesn’t tell you how to change your habits. In other words, it lacks solid advice. Rather, it presents real stories and anecdotes of how others have changed their habits. The overall approach of this book is one of: “Habits can be changed, if we understand how they work."" If you’re looking for some informative and intelligent non-fiction to read, I recommend this.Some interesting quotes: “How do habits change? There is, unfortunately, no specific set of steps guaranteed to work for every person. We know that a habit cannot be eradicated—it must, instead, be replaced.” ""Willpower isn't just a skill. It's a muscle, like the muscle in your arms or legs, and it gets tired as it works harder, so there's less power left over for other things."""
84,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9653496-hanne,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is a well researched, well written book about habits and the psychology behind it. And yet, it was far from a home run. What I want most of all from reading non-fiction popular psychology books is for them to have an impact on me. The very basic requirement is to learn something new, but I also want them to make me think about my actions and behaviours and those from people around me, and preferably also to have a changing impact on me, which can be small or large, but has to be meaningful in some ways.This book achieved the interesting learning part, perhaps a bit of understanding behaviours, but definitely not the third. He does attempt to explain how to change behaviours and some people might find it useful. But I wanted more.The scope of the book is good though, starting from individual habits, how companies can change your habits, to organizational and cultural habits. Maybe because of this larger scope, it became more a show-and-tell about how others have done it, but it doesn’t really give you the ammunition to do it yourself. "

Mi-a plăcut mult și cum Duhigg a oferit exemple atât de diverse (și chiar fascinante) de deprinderi care au marcat viețile unor oameni cât se poate de obișnuiți. Cât de importante pot fi deprinderile pozitive și cât de dăunătoare cele negative.

89,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7645496-wai-yip-tung,Rating 1 out of 5,"The Power of Habit is a plainly bad book. So bad that in half of the book, the author just don't know what he is talking about.By now I have identified this genre of non-fiction book I would call Malcolm Gladwell-esque, journalists packaged popular science or popular psychology books. They would write about a topic with some scientific basis, but often spiced up to look very much like they have discovered some secret formula of success. Unfortunately their literary skill gets far ahead of their analytic skill. The result is an illusion that dazzle people at the beginning. But ultimately turn out to have little substance.The thesis and the secret formula to success in this book is habit. Had Duhigg concentrate on the finding in science and neurological underpinning of personal habits, it would have been a mildly interesting book. Once he takes this thesis and apply it to organization and social level, it falls apart quickly.He write at length about how new habit introduced to corporation like Aloca is a huge success story that turned the company around. Mind you what he call organization's habit we usually refer as ""corporate culture"". If you have never suspected ""corporate culture"" could have effect on its performance then Duhigg's book would be a revelation for you. But to most people who have some business sense, Duhigg has add nothing to add to the familiar topic of corporate culture other than his spiced up anecdotes.The book reach its low point when he try to explain Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott incident. To drive the habit theme he use the term liberally in the passages, results in curious phrases like the habit of friendship? the habit of peer pressure? and the social habit of weak ties? 'Habit' has become an entirely meaningless buzzword. Had he dropped the term from the sentences, they would at least be understandable vocabularies like ""friendship"", ""peer pressure"" and ""weak ties"". ""Weak ties"", being a well known concept of social and network science, further expose Duhigg's weakness as he wrote about it at length and it shows he has a lot of misconception about the idea.Ultimately he story about the power of habit really have little predictive and discriminatory power. If the social structure of the black community (I can't bring myself to say social habit) of the Montgomery explains the Rosa Parks incident, then why is it such one-off event? Since the social structure is well established why isn't it deliver forceful activism all the time? And what about all other communities that have similar social structure to Montgomery? What evidence can you find that demonstrate the power of so call ""xxx"" habit in these other communities?(Review is base on reading of selected chapters)."

Or perhaps it was the cigarette. Or the drink.Habit.Did you know that the genius behind the methods of Tom Dungy–the only coach in the NFL history to reach the play-offs ten years in a row and the one who turned a troubled Colts team around and three years later took them to win the Super Bowl in 2007–was to teach his players to be faster than everyone else. But they wouldn’t be faster because they would focus on increasing their physical speed. They would be faster because they would learn habits that would make their moves instinct. When his strategy worked, Dungy’s players could move with a speed that was impossible to overcome.According to some research, more than 40% of the actions we perform each day are not actual decisions, but habits. And habits that we didn’t always consciously choose to start. We have sleeping habits, shopping habits, exercise habits, eating habits. Habits at work, at home, at school. Habits of the mind.Companies have a huge interest in changing our shopping habits. Coaches have an interest in changing the habits we use when we play. Teachers have an interest in the habits of their classroom. Families and communities have habitual ways of interacting. We all have personal habits we’d like to adopt and others we’d like to give away. But unless you know what you’re doing, habits can be extremely intransigent and slippery things.The good news is that a lot of research has been done in the last few decades, and we now know how habits work. When we arm ourselves with this knowledge, we’ll have a much better chance of changing. Luckily for us, we don’t have to track all that information down. In The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do In Life and Business, Charles Duhigg draws on hundreds of academic studies, interviews with more than three hundred scientists and executives, and research conducted at dozens of companies in his book and distills all this knowledge to its essence.The title might sound boring, but Duhigg follows the style of Malcom Gladwell (Outliers, Blink, The Tipping Point), and the Heath brothers (Made to Stick), and has written a book that I couldn’t put down. For example, I couldn’t stop reading about coach Tom Dungy, or Target as it predicts who is pregnant and how far along they are, or the scientists who couldn’t figure out why Alcoholics Anonymous works, or how bad organizational habits led to thirty-one people being burned alive in London’s King’s Cross subway stop. I couldn’t stop reading about why Rosa Parks, not the first African American to refuse to give up her bus seat, could pivot the civil rights movement. I couldn’t stop reading the stories of individuals losing bad habits, others picking up good ones, and others who lost their minds but not their habits. Duhigg uses these and many other examples and studies to illustrate the key principles underlying how habits work. In the appendix, he gives us a guide for examining and forming our own habits.I personally know the power of changing habits of the mind (which I’ve already written about). And teeth. A few years ago, I flossed once a week. It was such a pain. Now it’s a habit that I almost crave each night. I look back at how I made those changes and see it all laid out in Duhigg’s book. Can I actually change my habit of going to bed late? Stay tuned.If you’re interested in forming the habits of a class, team, company, or family; if you want to change some of your own habits; if you’re interested in knowing why we do what we do and enjoy the style of Malcom Gladwell and Dan and Chip Heath, then I think you’ll love this book.

Fortunately, my concerns vanished away with the very first pages.This book guided me to understand thoroughly the meaning of a habit cycle, and instead of asking to break it, Charles Duhigg pointed out how to modify it into my benefit, aided with many studies and historic examples of real people who applied the change. Not only it focuses on habits from a personal view, but also it illustrates how big companies and influencers used the power of habit to their profit, how it affects society, and, last but not least, the neurology behind it. Ending with a reader’s guide to use the ideas by providing a frame work of steps towards habits modification. I immensely enjoyed reading this book for what I gained from it regarding habits and another aspects of our daily lives. "

It stops working so hard, or diverts focus to other tasks. So unless you deliberately fight a habit, unless you find new routines the pattern will unfold automatically.While reading this book, I was socked realizing how many times I acted just by habit. Times when I didn’t think at all, just did what habit part of my brain told me to. This process within our brains is a three-step loop. First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future: THE HABIT LOOPThis book talks about habits and the psychology behind them.It’s well written and well researched; however I didn’t exactly liked full detailed case studies. It’s like the author thinks you don’t really understood what he said in early chapters and wants to explain it again and again in different case studies."

Duhigg discusses the science of habits and provides excellent anecdotes to support his theories. The chapters cover various topics, all seen through the prism of people's habits: exercise and diet, Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, shoppers at Target, the birth of the civil rights movement, and more. I'm a big fan of Malcolm Gladwell and there are parts of this book that read like something from him. Like Gladwell, Duhigg takes the science and applies it to areas that might not be typically associated with such (for example, the civil rights movement). Most importantly, he makes it easy for the layperson to understand. "

It's become more a friend, a comfort book rather than a text for learning new things, and so it is time to move on. Seriously. I have an audio version, a paperback by my bed and a kindle copy on my phone. It is not rocket science, but it is a common sense voice that talks me out of despair sometimes, it pats me on my back when mini-victories occur and says the hard things friends need to dispatch from time to time. And then, I realize this is just a book, not a friend, and interestingly enough that gives me options to go either way. I have found this book helpful, in spite of its being based on opinion and observation rather than science. Having it handy will continue to be its status 'round here - for the foreseeable future, at least."
111,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15719193-lily,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ця книжка виявилася абсолютно не тим, чого я чекала. Тут багато історій з життя, які ілюструють процес вироблення звичок - всі вони поділені на три розділи - звички людей, організацій та громад. Написано легко, читається швидко, але не всі історії були для мене прикладами звичок, деякі моменти видалися трохи притягнутими. Ну, і загалом я не надто люблю таку концепцію побудови нон-фікшну, хочеться більше науковості. Автор книги - журналіст і він вирішив зробити щось середнє між документалістикою і науковою розвідкою. Поміж того всього я знайшла для себе інформацію, яку чекала - якби не історії, вона могла б вміститися в одну статтю. Хоча, по прочитанні мені тепер важко зрозуміти, чи всі ці купи прикладів живих людей, громад, супермаркетів, кав'ярень і виробників аерозолів якось повпливали на легше сприйняття наукової інформації. Нижче буде багато цитат, які окреслюють суть книжки. Записала їх спеціально для себе, бо книгу продаватиму, перечитувати її точно не буду.Понад 40% дій, що їх люди виконують щодня, - насправді не рішення, а звички.Процес, коли мозок перетворює послідовність дій на автоматичний алгоритм називається фрагментація і лежить в основі формування звичок.Звички виникають через те, що мозок повсякчас шукає способу заощадити зусилля. Інстинктивне заощадження зусиль - колосальна перевага. Ефективний мозок потребує менше простору, а отже голова може мати менші розміри, що полегшує процес народження дитини, і завдяки цьому знижується смертність серед немовлят і породіль. Цикл звичкиВказівка->Шаблон->Винагорода. Коли виникає звичка, мозок припиняє повноцінну участь у процесі ухвалення рішень.Якби циклів звички не існувало, наш мозок не міг би опрацювати мільйони деталей повсякденного життя і вийшов би з ладу. Люди, чиї базальні ядра були вражені внаслідок травми чи хвороби, часто стають розумово паралізованими. Їм важко виконувати найпростіші дії - відчиняти двері чи вирішувати, що з'їсти на обід. Вони втрачають здатність ігнорувати неістотні деталі.Чому звички такі могутні: вони створюють неврологічний потяг. Ми асоціюємо вказівки з конкретними винагородами, у мозку виникає підсвідомий потяг, що запускає цикл звички.Звичку неможливо викорінити, - натомість її можна змінити. Щоб перепрограмувати цю формулу, треба знову почати робити вибір. Залишити стару вказівку й винагороду та додати новий шаблон поведінки. А також повірити, що це реально.Визначте шаблонПоекспериментуйте з винагородамиВиокреміть вказівкуСкладіть план дійПроблема в тому, що мозок не бачить різниці між добрими і поганими звичками, тому, якщо колись в нас була погана звичка, вона й досі там - причаїлася в мозку й чекає на правильні вказівки й винагороди.У мозку немає вродженої програми, яка б викликала бажання поласувати солодким, щойно ми побачили тарілку з пампушками. Але після того, як мозок дізнається, що на тарілці з пампушками - солоденький цукор та інші вуглеводи, він вже очікуватиме, що рівень цукру в крові незабаром підскочить. Почавши регулярно тренуватися, навіть один раз на тиждень, люди підсвідомо змінюють інші шаблони поведінки у своєму житті, зовсім непов'язані зі спортом. Коли люди ""нарощували"" ""вольові м'язи"" в одній сфері свого життя - змінювався їх спосіб харчування, зростала продуктивність. Змі��ніла сила волі впливала на все. Для багатьох людей заняття спортом - це наріжна звичка, яка дає поштовх до інших змін. Наріжні звички утворюють структуру, що допомагає закріпитися іншим звичкам. Наріжні звички змінюють нас, створюючи культуру, котра підкреслює цінності, про які раніше забулося б в момент сумніву.  Маленькі перемоги сприяють змінам, позаяк перетворюють крихітні досягнення на закономірність, що допомагає людям повірити, що їм під силу більші досягнення.Споживачі потребують якогось сигналу про те, що продукт діє. Можна зробити зубну пасту з яким завгодно смаком, основне, щоб вона давала відчуття прохолоди й поколювання, тоді людям здаватиметься, що в роті чисто. Піна - колосальна винагорода. Шампунь не мусить пінитися, але ми додаємо до нього спеціальні хімічні речовини, бо люди чекають на піну щоразу, як миють волосся."

This is the central theme of this book and this book goes in great detail about what are habits, scientifically, physiologically and how we can make Habit has the central focus of the activities around us, the events that we subject ourself to and the way we respond to every day seemingly insignificant events. This is a great book to understand human factors and mechanisms of our behavior, our friends behavior and behavior of people we see around us. This book is full of interesting anecdotes from different fields ranging from medicine, fields like mental health, hospital's organizational behaviors to the behavior of large organizations like Starbucks and Target. The book goes de-route into some recent advances in data-science as how organizations collect data to predict the ""Habits"" of it's customers and once it understand's the Habits, they know that they are not dealing with the rational self-controlled individual, but with more primitive part of the brain so they can easily have their way with them. There is a whole organization effort put into this and huge lot of science and tools built on top of this theory, namely to make customers purchase the product even when they dont need it, but their habit will make them buy it. Organizations are earning scores of the profit in this way.There is also good analysis of how leaders operate in mobilizing the masses, They give them a habit and people see the reward in following that habit. The reward in these cases are non materialist, but they equally valuable. Great leaders like Martin Luther King, gave his folks a sense of identity and community, encouraged the Habit of refusing to board the bus when there was in-equality. I can say the same for Mahatma Gandhi, who encouraged Indians to spin wheel to make their own clothes to ""obtain freedom"", his idea was this habit will make Indians disciplined and give them a concept of self identify. Both these strategies worked out and this book says that there science behind those plans that is basis of huge organizational change.Author presents with numerous case studies of people and their behaviors to elucidate the concept of habits and try to convince to you look actions and behavior in this angle. And if you want to change a particular habit, which I believe many are interested in, he gives definite direction as how one should approach. Simply stated, it involves identifying the cue or carving that is responsible for the habit and identifying the reward, and experimenting with different rewards when you want to change and the working on the change the habit loop and having plan for the cue. Don't get misled that now you know this idea, you can skip this book. This book will drill down into your head this formula and you will imbibe some ideas suitable for yourself as you read this book. Plus it is extremely entertaining to know how we have been led by some parts of our brain to do many of our actions. It is presented very well as illustrates with an example of himself changing a habit, eating a cookie in the afternoon, following those simple rules. Great read. Why 4 stars out of 5. I felt the sometimes the book deviated a bit too much into business and interesting data-science things and presented them in more detail, which of course holds on to the reader for entertainment than focusing on the topic in every page."

In the class me and one of my friends were having conversation on consistency, lately I was having some questions in my mind. ""If somebody has ethics in his/her core, is it possible for him/her to behave unethically?"" My friend replied, 'Yes it's possible when they behave habitually.' After returning home that day I remembered I read exactly the same in this book earlier in the morning.""Most of the choices we make each day may feel like the products of well-considered decision making, but they are not. They are habits."" That's where the distinction is made I believe. When we're aware of our habit, we have knowledge of it then we're responsible for choosing it,for carrying it,that's where comes the point---""the ethics of habit.""I remember the first few scenes from Fight Club where Edward Norton was badly suffering from insomnia & couldn't enjoy a sleep.Then he developed a habit of attending various support groups, soon after he found a purpose it was easier for him to concentrate until he met with the odd(Marla) in his regular familiar pattern. While reading the book this scene came to mind as how habits & practices are formed & eventually have an effect.It was an useful reading. How Pepsodent turned brushing into a national habit & promoted its business.How starbucks focus on developing the behavior of its employees so that they can stand the heat of critical hours. How multinational companies focus on developing a group habit to change their employees effort & attitude to their job for the benefit of the company. How othercompanies like large scale data integration companies predict & exploit human behavior & habits to boost up their sales. How neurological & emotional habits emerge. How emotions turn into a habit & how we respond to them automatically every time the same pattern emerges. So when we say ' this is how we are ' that's basically 'how our habits our' because everybody after all is the sum totalof some habits.But habits are not destiny. There's always a way around to work out with them, to replace them. অনুপম রায়ের কথায় , "" শোন অভ্যেস বলে কিছু হয় না এ পৃথিবীতে ,পাল্টে যাওয়াই বেঁচে থাকা ... """
115,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65764-lana,Rating 4 out of 5,"I read this book after reading its overall message in article form. Duhigg makes the claim that habits are everything, and then offers ways to change them in order to improve your life. This is not schlocky self-help- the tone is a little more subdued and a little more academic than most books of that nature. He can make habit-changing seem facile at times, which is eyebrow-raising when he's talking about addiction and addictive behavior, but he does come back at the end to point out that while understanding how to change habits is easy, changing them does require hard work, dedication, and time. Less easy. This is shown when the author attempts to change a simple habit- eating a cookie every day- and has to go through over a week of experimentation to identify the cue and reward, and then switch the habit. One point that I did not expect to see is about the power of belief- new habits only stick through times of stress and pressure if the person believes- in the reason for change or in the fact that that change is possible. Old habits *do* die hard- in fact, they never die at all. The patterns your brain learns are always going to be in there. Another useful piece of information was about cues- it may sound easy, but identifying the cues that your brain uses to decide when to go into autopilot can be very challenging.

117,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1280565-rob,Rating 3 out of 5,"It's a fascinating read, combining some very accessible medical science with insights into human behaviour. Duhigg's an entertaining writer as well as an extensively-researched one; he uses suspense to superb effect at several points, and his revelations on the predictive power of Big Data in identifying our habits are startling. The first half and concluding sections are especially compelling, particularly with his recipe for changing old habits into new ones.I'm less convinced by his look at organizations and societies. It's always dangerous to argue from analogy, and by considering such forces as racism and organizational culture as habits, he downplays important factors — for example, the vested interest that some people have in maintaining the status quo, and their active efforts to thwart change. That doesn't mean the insights he offers aren't useful, especially when they target individual behaviour, but there comes a point where you wonder if there's any organizational behaviour pattern that Duhigg wouldn't consider to be a habit. (I started to hear his voice in my head saying that gravity is one of matter's habits.)Maybe the best measure of its immediate impact is how many of my own habits I'm suddenly identifying - which is lots. As for the longer-run impact, lets see how many of them I end up changing."
118,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"“The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business” http://amzn.to/2GY61b1  is not a self-improvement guide but rather clarifies how propensities are shaped, their effect, and how they can be changed. This book is incredible. It changed my view on how propensities formed my life. It is in not a manual or far reaching study, still it is very well investigated and tastefully composed.""The Power of Habit"" showed me an incredible reality about myself and other individuals. It clarifies why propensities are difficult to change; how to transform them; and why it can be anything but difficult to slip again into negative behavior patterns. It clarifies why it might take numerous actions to change a propensity. This book as helps anybody to figure out how to help others with and comprehend their own propensities. It utilizes anecdotes of individuals to help arrive point over. No big surprise it was a success on Amazon.com  http://amzn.to/2GY61b1  and will enable anybody to distinguish how their propensities are made. Essentially, you search for the prompts/triggers that are opening the normal/propensity that you are not content with and can't appear to stop. Once you figure out what is the reward you are getting you modify your craving for that reward. Is it true that you are eating the treat due to low glucose or claiming you are anxious, and it quiets you, and so on? While pouring through this book I got the chance to know the propensity circle and how to not really stop a propensity but rather to change it and to enable the person to have control, nixing the propensities power over me supplanting it with a new, healthier one. The stories in this book are wonderful and educate not just about propensities but additionaly a wide range of subjects of life. The best part about this book, it never went into some irrational tangent where you couldn’t comprehend what it was stating. Nonetheless, finding the triggers and rewards requires some serious energy and thoughtfulness - all dependent upon you. The book can't help you there. If you are looking for more “active” material, reads that give actual how-to steps here are some other reads that are in the same genre and which might be more beneficial to the reader depending upon your objectives:•	 “The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life”  http://amzn.to/2Bgn9IU This book is a consistent bestseller on Amazon.com which makes it acceptable to change the “habit” of giving into other’s complaints, to treat demands for what they are. . . other peoples’ problems. •	 “The 2 Week Diet”  https://tinyurl.com/y8tva8xy A great program designed to re-design your eating habits for better health•	 “Old School New Body”  https://tinyurl.com/y8rcefrg This is a way to change the habits of poor health to those that lead to a better physique. •	 “The Big Diabetes Lie”  https://tinyurl.com/y794lh3q Have your habits lead you to be a diabetic, or pre-diabetic? Mine had, that is why I benefitted from this book and now no longer am a diabetic. I highly recommend this habit changing program. In any case, per the book, once you do identify triggers, you change the normal/propensity by power of will each time you experience the signal/trigger, ensuring that the reward is the same. Along these lines, rather than eating sweets, you simply run talk with companions intentionally, or whatever. I got this book supposing it was a self-improvement write for those needing to get out from under negative behavior patterns however that was not the situation; This book really clarifies the mechanics of how propensities are made and why they are so imbued into our frameworks. For instance, a man who lost all working memory in a mischance still held his propensity for taking strolls in his neighborhood. It expressly demonstrates how propensities are framed at a more fundamental and primal zone of our cerebrum which makes it so hard to change. Troublesome, yet not feasible.  “The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business”  http://amzn.to/2GY61b1  isn't a program that is laid out or unmistakable advances that one must take, however it gives you enough learning that you could work out your own framework for changing a propensity you never again need to have. When you have a craving for taking part in the ""terrible"" propensity supplant that propensity with another one you want to do that gives you a similar sort of reward/result/feeling. Do this again and again until the point when it progresses toward becoming . . . a propensity. The book causes us to see how propensities function and its effect in our lives. Seeing how propensities function could really make it simpler to grow great propensities and quit terrible ones. I truly delighted in the primary portion of the book more as it was centered around people and associations. The later 50% of the book was about propensities for social orders and it could have had a superior consummation by bringing it through and through. It was extremely intriguing to know how organizations focus on our propensities to advertise their items. In the wake of reading ""The Power of Habit,"" I felt incredibly enabled. I suddenly comprehended why it appears that I have no self-discipline. I could stop thrashing myself for my past disappointments and begin rolling out positive improvements. Regardless of whether you're hoping to change your life or not, it's an extremely intriguing read that will give you incredible understanding into how intense little propensities are in deciding how we carry on. General it was a decent book and I profoundly prescribe it to individuals hoping to make great propensities and surrender unfortunate propensities. "

While this is no doubt true, author Charles Duhigg insists that this is but the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the impact that habits have on our daily lives. Indeed, in his new book `The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business' Duhigg argues that habits not only pervade our personal lives, but that they have an integral role to play in the businesses and other organizations of which we are a part, and that they are also at the heart of social movements and societies at large.The first part of the book focuses on the role that habits play in our personal lives. Here we learn about the habit loop consisting of cue, routine, and reward, and how the elements in this loop can be manipulated to help modify our habits (say from crashing on the couch with a bag of chips, to heading out for a run). We also learn about the power of particular habits called keystone habits (which include exercise, as well as eating together as a family) that help initiate a domino effect that touches all of the other aspects of our lives. Also, we learn about the power of belief--and the importance of social groups in helping create this belief--that stands behind successful habit transformation programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous.The second part of the book concentrates on how habits help shape businesses and organizations. Here we learn that the formation of habits and routines within organizations is unavoidable; what's more, that it is always best for the leadership of a group to make a deliberate effort to shape the habits of their organizations, and in a way that ensures a high degree of equality and fairness for its various members, while nonetheless making it clear who is ultimately in charge of each particular aspect of the operation. Second, we learn that keystone habits--which are at the center of our personal lives--are also pivotal when it comes to larger organizations (and how a particular keystone habit was applied to resurrect the once great but flailing American aluminum company Alcoa). We also learn about the greatest keystone habit of all: willpower, and how this habit can best be cultivated (and how companies such as Starbucks are employing these lessons to help train employees successfully). Finally, we learn about how companies such as Proctor & Gamble and Target instill habits in their customers.The third and final part of the book examines the importance of habits in social movements, such as the civil rights movement of the 1960's. Here we learn that movements tend to follow a three-part process. To start with, a movement tends to begin with a group of close acquaintances and friends. The movement tends to grow when these people spread it to the broader communities of which they are a part. Finally, in order to really take hold and spread, the movement must be guided forward by an effective leader who lays down new habits for the movement's adherents in a way that allows them to gain a sense of identity.On the negative side, the organization of the book is somewhat muddled, as there is significant overlap in the parts on individuals and organizations. Also, the section on social movements rests on a precious few examples, and therefore, the theory seems less convincing than it might otherwise be. Still, though, there are many things to be learned here and the book is well worth the read. A full executive summary of the book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2012/03/18...A podcast discussion of the book is also available."

Not so much.Here's why: 1) There is no explanation of how one goes about changing habits, or if there are they aren't necessarily in this book. There's not even any explanation about the Premarck Principle. How did this guy write a book about habits and omit that?!?!?! As a how-to manual this failed;2) Despite the claims the author made about speaking with 100's of scientists there was no real discussion of how psychology works. You can protest this, but frankly the tiny and frail explanation that did appear was back of cereal box worthy. As a scientific exploration of the psychology of habits, this book failed;3) All of the case studies were dull dull dull (football, fires in the London underground, ...) God gad! how can one make a fatal fire in the London underground dull? By the time I got towards the end of the book and Mr. Duhigg FINALLY gave an example that I should have been interested in--the successful sea change in the life of the American philosopher/psychologist William James--all of my attention and goodwill had trickled away. As a page-turner, this failed; 4) Annoyingly edited so that case studies, when begun, are interspersed with other stories. This would've been fine if Mr. Duhigg were a more skilled writer. As a book designed to edify and raise the human soul it failed; 5) After Mr. Duhigg blathered on about football for 100 ... 100, nay, a thousand ... interminable pages, I realized he was writing for people who gamble on televised sports.

While still cautious of such writings, I have found that many of them can be very helpful. Humans are a complex creation of God, consisting of a spirit, soul, and body. In the same way that a study of plants yielded the discovery of photosynthesis (a process designed by God to utilize sunshine in a plant's feeding cycle), so the study of humans has revealed many amazing processes that sustain our lives in this world. Some are physical; others are neurological, but together they help us understand how we function. Conservative Christians should not be afraid to learn from books that identify how these processes work. The Power of Habit is a fascinating and helpful book in understanding the science and psychology (in the best sense of the term) behind the habits we form. It is a completely secular work, but the research it appeals to is sound. The applications it makes are helpful. The illustrations - which make up a large part of the writing - are fascinating. They connect us to common struggles. They provide hope that lives can be changed; that bad habits can be broken and that good habits can be formed. As a secular work, the author does not address the fallen nature of man that creates our capacity for unhelpful, bad, or destructive habits. It does not provide the additional hope a Christian finds in a new birth and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. In this sense, it falls short of pointing people to all that God has provided to rescue us from fallenness. Those who know and understand these spiritual realities should find The Power of Habit a solid resource in their pursuit for a changed life. It provides additional insight into God's creative design and reinforces many biblical truths. Reading it was a good investment of my time."

136,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5031502-dani-shuping,Rating 4 out of 5,"“The Power of Habit” is one of those rare books that I started recommending before I even finished it. Charles Duhigg writes a practical book that pulls from multiple sources to explain how habits work, how they’re developed, how they’re formed in the brain, and how we might go about transforming them. Written in the style of Malcolm Gladwell’s books, Charles translates scientific language into clear, concise, and easy to understand for the average reader. He breaks the book down into three main sections--”The Habits of Individuals,” “The Habits of Successful Organizations,” and “The Habits of Societies”--and provides clear examples to back up what he’s written and his examples cover a wide range. For example, he writes about how Tony Dungy changed habits of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to mold them into a winning football team. And he talks about how the former CEO of ALECO championed safety in order to increase company profits. This is a book that anyone, anywhere can get something out of. While Duhigg doesn’t provide specifics of how to change habits in my ARC, (there will be an appendix in the final addition that may do so) there is still ample evidence in the examples of things that you can do and think about as ways to change/modify the habits you’ve built over a lifetime. Overall this is a fascinating book that made me think more about why I do what I do and how I might be able to change it."
137,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6217216-allan-elder,Rating 3 out of 5,"The basics of this book are fascinating. The Habit Loop consists of a cue, which calls a routine, which seeks a reward. That is whole book. There is little reason to read the rest of it unless you like a lot examples of this loop. Unfortunately, the book does not really explore the science of habits and absolutely, completely, ignores the research on behaviorism which explains the entire premise of the book. The science of behaviorism, while not popular, covers this material in a way that is actionable. Look at the ""amazing"" discovery of cue, routine, and reward and compare it the decades old behavioral idea of Antecedent, Behavior, and Consequence (the ABCs). Duhigg, identifies the habits as ""That psychology was grounded in two basic rules: First, find a simple and obvious cue. Second, clearly define the rewards."" He then spends the next dozen pages with examples from commercials. If you understand the ""ABCs"" then the book holds little value (unless you like stories). Jump to the Appendix ""A Reader's Guide to Using These Ideas"" and read it only. It covers everything discussed in the book but at least gives a hint about using the habit concept for change. The advice? Identify the routine, experiment with satisfying rewards, isolate the cue, and have a plan. That's it. If it matters, my review is based on the Kindle edition."
138,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/118210-sarah,Rating 4 out of 5,"Very interesting. Duhigg’s breakdown of the habit cycle ( Cue —> Routine —> Reward) is simple but it doesn’t follow that it’s easy just to change the routine. Sadly (for me) there is no magical formula to stop wasting time/exercise more/take vitamins/eat better, but it did confirm that breaking bad habits and forming better ones is really hard to do, so hooray for validation. Personally I found the section on the habits of successful organizations the most interesting. Duhigg cites research showing that an organization's routines function as habits, and these can either create success or result in thoughtless risk, waste and danger (depending on the industry). Similar to French pop culture child-raising notions (where parents must enforce a non-negotiable cadre within which a child has vast freedom), successful employees have considerable choice within their daily work lives (choice about shifts, uniforms, etc. lead to far greater productivity), but only so long as there is a clear ultimate decision maker. A “keystone” organizational habit (e.g., Alcoa’s prioritizing workplace safety above all else) can lead to higher quality and output by fostering subsequent habits of ownership and accountability. "

Presenta los conceptos claves de los patrones y conductas subconscientes que generamos y cómo entenderlas. Hasta ahí, el libro hace un trabajo fantástico. Siento también, que todo el contenido rescatable de CBT lo puedes leer perfectamente igual en wikipedia o cualquier sitio de internet del tema e incluso mucho más completo. La única diferencia es que aquí te lo presentan de un modo muy interesante y con buenos testimonios.

Why and how we do things by force of habit was interesting enough, but being tracked by retailers to determine buying habits so they can target your needs and cravings was a real eye-opener! Target is the retailer exampled in this book, which makes you wonder why they chose that name. And apparently even gambling casinos can keep track of habitual gamblers and use their addiction to keep them coming back for more. The author takes a complicated subject with a lot of scientific study available, and makes it simple and entertaining enough for any reader. The 4 star rating is for the things I learned through reading this book that I never knew before. The social habits that fed the Montgomery bus boycotts after Rosa Parks arrest in 1955 were mind blowing. This is quite a read."

153,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20434984-david-bjelland,Rating 4 out of 5,"Part of me wants to give this book one star and denounce it as mushy-brained neoliberal propaganda. Another part wants to give it 5 stars and make misty-eyed testimonials to total strangers on the train about the power of applied behavioral psychology to structure and guide a total personal/spiritual rebirth. One reason that, at least at the time of writing, the first one is especially compelling: substantiating this intoxicating sense of optimism and clarity I feel right now would require results, and results take time and effort, whereas I could expound on reasons to dismiss it as insidiously ""apolitical"", lowest-common-denominator pap right now, with less mental energy than it would take to even write a to-do list for the day. Some points I might trot out if I were going that route: 1. Duhigg uses anecdotes from the field of Consumer Psychology to illustrate the principles of habit psychology more generally. But, far from exposing it in order to critique it or offer strategies for resisting it, he seems to share the marketers' and advertisers' own cynical sense of treating underconsumption as a scientific problem to be studied and solved by any means necessary. If we're constantly distracted, buried in debt, and deprived of authentic community bonds because consumer psychologists have perfected the art of hijacking our subconscious minds, then the problem - Duhigg seems to argue, if only by omission - isn't the unchecked power of them to exploit us for profit, but our own individual failure to exercise the same principles on ourselves and for our own goals. Somehow, it's our job as plebes to beat the experts at their own game. 2. Similarly, in the Starbucks chapter: we learn about the company's unusually holistic employee training w/r/t emotional self-regulation, which really boils down to habits and planning. It's acknowledged that these skills are critical both inside and outside of the workplace, and that many have to learn them from Starbucks' job training because they never learned them from their family, school, or community. But TPoH isn't actually interested in these skills per se, or the good that could be achieved by reshaping our institutions to better teach them. In Starbucks' corporate ideology (which the chapter uncritically repeats), emotional self-regulation is only valuable to the extent that it inoculates workers against entitled customers' own unregulated emotions. The logic of the market goes unquestioned: high standards of self-mastery for workers, coddling and infantilization for consumers who can afford the products of their labor; workers' boundaries and dignity subordinated to consumers' whims. 3. I'll concede that the chapter on social movements offers a compelling framework in the abstract, but the specifics show a level of historical revisionism only a couple degrees shy of that one iconic ""Slavery was bad but then Lincoln fixed it 😊"" parody tweet. Consider his snowglobe fantasy version of the modern US LGBT movement, which goes beyond the sad norm of repackaging Stonewall's radicalism in the inoffensive language of ""tolerance"" and ""human rights""; instead, it leaves it out entirely, singling out a subcommittee of the American Library Association for starting to galvanize a movement and turn the tide of public opinion. [Now would be a good time to use those skills you learned at Starbucks to stop yourself from screaming and throwing your device through a window]The examples are specific to TPoH, but the strategy is intrinsic to the Self Help genre itself, especially within the ""Corporate-"" sub-genre that the middle third of the book operates in: frame the system that we operate in as ahistorical, value-neutral, and immutable, then focus on how individuals can optimize themselves to better meet its demands. It works this way not because of an organized conspiracy to placate the masses (I mean... as far as I know). The genre's just an inevitable function of a sort of Natural Law: that improving yourself is relatively straightforward and likely to succeed at least a little bit, while improving society is awkward, messy, and risky, even in the rare event that most people agree on what ""improvement"" means. THAT SAID - and I'm going to apologize in advance for using some vague, intellectually lazy shortcuts in the interest of space - here's the thing:For every argument one could think up that somehow ""the system"" (ugh) ""wants"" (UGGHHH) to keep us in the ""hamster wheel"" (🤢) of individual gratification and individual self-improvement, distracting from the innate interdependence and collective power of the 99% (🤮)... there's an equally plausible sounding argument for the exact opposite.If the framework that Duhigg presents is basically ""true"", then the psychology itself doesn't care whether we apply it to squeeze more emotional labor out of ourselves for the same wage, or if we use it to resist the machinations of consumer psychologists and stop buying shit we don't need. If we're better in control of our intentions and desires, it's true that we'll have the ability to be more productive at our jobs; but if we get the same amount of work done with less time and/or willpower, the choice of whether to invest the savings into more work or our own social / creative / spiritual lives, is, like any other choice, one that's more likely to be made unconsciously if we're blind to and powerless over our own habits. And at the end of the day, as much as I sometimes entertain flattering delusions of being talented, self-possessed and self-directed, the truth is I've spent most of my adult life feeling like I'm barely keeping my shit together, prefrontal cortex idling and sputtering as the rest of my brain hogs the controls, finding excuses to second-guess itself, render the same memories and fantasies over and over, or optimize multi-variable cost-benefit analyses on mundane decisions whose outcomes I couldn't care less about. My brain feels like this big, super-cool moth, using its powerful, beautiful wings to ram itself into the same #&$*ing hot, bright object over and over ad infinitum before registering that it's actually just a porch light and moving along. And that seems like a problem that can be studied, explained, and gradually mitigated, empirically and systematically, and this feels like as good a book as any to do that. [Oh, and throw in an extra star out of grudging respect for making me helpless to stop from plowing through all of it in two sittings]"

156,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,Rating 3 out of 5,"In this book, Charles Duhigg takes a look at habits from a number of different perspectives - individual habits, like exercising or drinking, organizational habits, like how departments within corporations communicate with one another, and societal habits, such as those that can motivate individuals to undertake certain actions as a group. His thesis is that habits control a large part of behavior on all these levels. Habits can't be eliminated, he says, but by becoming conscious of them and taking certain steps, we can replace undesirable habits with more productive ones.It's an interesting theory, and he fleshes it out with a number of intriguing anecdotes. While the stories he tells are all quite fascinating in their own light, however, I don't feel they illustrated his points quite as successfully as he thinks they do. Take, for example, Alcoholics Anonymous. He highlights the group as an example of a system that creates habit change. And while it certainly has been successful for some members, its high failure rates undermine Duhigg's thesis even as he presents it. Duhigg amends his thesis to account for this failure with the idea that those engaging in habit change need to believe in what they are doing in order for it to work long term. Yet I don't think it would be too hard to find people who have fallen off the wagon despite their belief in the program.Throughout numerous other examples, Duhigg continually assumes correlation equals causation and gives credit in places I don't believe is necessarily due. For this reason, the book isn't as solid as it could be. That said, however, the stories he tells about how change was facilitated by individuals and organizations are very thought-provoking and I definitely learned some things by reading them; the story of how a new CEO transformed the giant corporation Alcoa by focusing on worker safety was particularly interesting. In the appendix, Duhigg does acknowledge that there really isn't one specific way to create habit change, and doing it effectively is going to depend on the habit and the person or system involved. If one can accept that changing habits isn't as simple as he tries to make it sound earlier in the book, there may be useful information here."

Also, Target's freaking scary.

Other parts were well-documented and had some of that reporting flair that I was expecting from a journalist-author.While the book itself was a great overview of understanding the causes of behavioral habit, I found myself more interested in the case studies.

And it started tapering off. The cue, routine, reward loop was probably the only useful thing in the entire book. The author just reels in endless stories about habits. Sometimes it feels like an advertisement for Starbucks or Vigilante against Target. The fact that Alcoa did something to their safety habits does nothing to enlighten the reader, despite the author's elaborate attempts to convince otherwise. And boy the author can't stop telling unrelated stories. He ultimately fails to keep good on the cover phrase - ""Why we do what we do and how to change"" . One of those books I cursed myself for buying. Amazon's algorithm failed me spectacularly. Don't bother buying."

It's rated 3.99/5.0 on GoodReads, is 286 pages, and I rated it 5.0/5.0.I cannot recommend this book enough. In fact, as soon as I finished reading it, I purchased two more copies to give to people who I know will find it as helpful as I did. If you want to change a habit, lose weight, quit smoking, change drinking habits, read this book. It describes patterns and habits that shape our lives, and, if we can learn to recognize the cues, it's the first step toward shaping those patterns into the habits of a life we want to live.In addition to personal habits, the book delves into social group habits--what shapes the habits of people who act as a group. Very interesting. Thumbs up."

Harder part is identifying the cues and rewards that drive the habit.- making your bed and exercising will improve your life in many ways beyond the obvious. - writing a detailed step by step plan, and sharing that plan among friends that have similar goals, will help make the new habit easier to adopt.- retailers know A LOT about me.

Because in addition to all the practical advice, Duhigg is a really good story teller. I mean, he doesn't just tell stories; he weaves them together, stopping mid-way through one to pick up another, then returning to the original at just the right moment. Strange, but I find this book soothing in and of itself. The act of reading it brings calm - a sense of order - into the chaos of life. Big ups!...First Reading:Equal parts entertaining and practical.

Korkunç bir olasılıktı bu.---Bu eğitimin merkezinde, hayati önem taşıyan bir alışkanlığa yo ğun bir odaklanma yer alır: irade alışkanlığına. Yapılan onlarca araş tırma, iradenin bireysel başarıda en büyük önemi taşıyan yegane kilit taşı alışkanlık olduğunu göstermiştir. Örneğin 2005 tarihli bir çalışmada Pennsylvania Üniversitesi araştırmacıları, 164 sekizinci sınıf öğrencisini analiz ederek IQ'larını ve diğer faktörleri ölçtüler. ölçülen faktörler arasında, öğrencilerin ne kadar iradeli oldukları da vardı. Bu faktör öz-disipline yönelik testlerle ölçülüyordu. Yüksek seviyelerde irade ortaya koyan öğrencilerin, sınıflarında nispeten yüksek notlar aldıkları ve seçici okullara kabul edildikleri görüldü. Devamsızlık yaptıkları günler daha seyrek, televizyon kar şısında geçirdikleri vakitler daha az, ödev yapmaya ayırdıkları saat ler daha fazlaydı. ""Öz-disiplini yüksek ergenler her türlü akademik performans alanında daha denetimsiz akranlarını geride bırakıyor lardı"" diye yazdı araştırmacılar. ""Öz-disiplin akademik performansın IQ'dan daha sağlam bir göstergesiydi. Öz-disiplin ayrıca, ders yılının ilerleyen dönemlerinde hangi öğrencilerin notlarını düzeltecekle rini de öngörüyordu, halbuki IQ bunu yapamazdı. ... Öz-disiplinin akademik performans üzerindeki etkisi, entelektüel yetenekten çok daha büyüktür.""---Yıllar sonra, araştırmaya katılan çocuklardan birçoğunu arayıp buldular. Çocuklar artık liseye gidiyorlardı. Araştırmacılar onla rın notlarını, SAT puanlarını, arkadaşlık sürdürme yeteneklerini, ""önemli sorunlarla başa çıkabilme"" kapasitelerini soruşturdular. Dört yaşındayken ödül için en çok bekleyebilen çocukların, lisede en iyi notları aldıklarını, SAT puanlarının da diğer çocuklara oranla ortalama 210 puan yüksek olduğunu keşfettiler. Daha popülerdiler. Daha azı uyuşturucu kullanıyordu---O zamandan beri bu fikir üstünde iki yüzden fazla çalışma gerçekleştirildi ve hepsinde aynı şey bulgu landı. İrade yalnızca bir beceri değildir. Kol ve bacaklarınızdaki kas lar gibi bir kastır. Çok çalıştığı zaman yorulur, dolayısıyla başka işlere daha az gücü kalır.İşten sonra koşuya çık mak gibi irade gerektiren bir şey yapmak istiyorsan, gün içinde irade kasını fazla yormamalısın"" dedi Muraven bana. ""Onu e-mail'ler yaz mak ya da karışık ve sıkıcı masraf formları doldurmak gibi bıktırıcı işlerle erkenden yorarsan, eve geldiğinde hiç iraden kalmamış olur.---Muraven nazik davranılmış öğrencilerin neden daha iradeli ol duklarını araşhrmaya başladığı zaman anladı ki, bu grubun diğe rinden en önemli farklılığı, deney üstünde kontrol sahibi oldukları duygusuydu. ""Aynı sonuca tekrar tekrar ulaşhk"" dedi Muraven bana. ""İnsanlardan otokontrol gerektiren bir şey yapmaları istendiğinde, bunu kişisel sebeplerle yaptıklarını düşünürlerse (yani kendi se çimleriyle, başka birine yardımcı olmaktan hoşlandıkları için yapı yorlarmış gibi hissederlerse) iş onlara daha az yorucu gelir. Hiçbir özerkliklerinin bulunmadığını hissederlerse, tek yaptıkları emirlere uymaksa, irade kasları çok daha hızlı yorulur. Her iki durumda da öğrenciler kurabiyeleri görmezden gelmişlerdi.

Firmalar daha ziyade, uzun zamandır süregelen organizasyonel alışkanlıklar tarafından yönlen dirilir. Bu alışkanlıklar, çoğu zaman binlerce çalışanın bağımsız ka rarlarından doğan davranış kalıplarıdır. Ve sanıldığından daha derin etkileri vardır.---Çoğu ekonomist, şirketlere herkesin ortak bir amaca (mümkün olduğunca çok para kazanmaya) bağlı kaldığı huzurlu yerlermiş gibi davranmaya alışkındır. Nelson ile Winter, gerçek dünyada işlerin hiç de böyle yürümediğine dikkat çekmiştir. Şirketler herkesin birbiriyle iyi geçindiği büyük ve mutlu aileler değildir. Tersine, çoğu işyeri,---yöneticilerin kendi performanslarını üstün, rakiplerininkiniyse daha kötü gösteren gizli çatışmalarda güç ve itibar için yarıştıkları dere beyliklerden oluşur. Departmanlar kaynaklar için yarışır ve övgüyü başkasına kaptırmamak için birbirlerini sabote ederler. Patronlar kimse darbe yapamasın diye astlarını birbirine düşürürler.

Bu adam, önemli müşterilerden biriyle yapacağı tek bir gizli telefon görüşmesiyle bir satışı baltalayabilecek ve bir meslektaşının departmanını sabote ederek onu terfi adaylığından alıkoyabilecek durumdadır. Sabotajın sakıncası, sizin için iyi olsa da firma için ge nellikle kötü olmasıdır. Dolayısıyla çoğu şirkette dillendirilmemiş bir taahhüt oluşur: Hırslı olmanın sakıncası yoktur, ama eğer oyunu fazla sert oynarsan arkadaşların sana karşı birlik olurlar. Öte yandan, rakibinizin kuyusunu kazmak yerine kendi departmanınızı geliştir meye odaklanırsanız da, zamanla muhtemelen sizin icabınıza bakı lacaktır.---Çalkantılar sırasında organizasyonel alışkanlıklar değişime açık hale geldiğinden, bir yandan insanlara sorumluluk verirken öte yandan daha eşitlikçi bir güç dengesi oluş turmak mümkün olur. Bir kriz aslında o kadar kıymetlidir ki, bazen onun körelip sönmesine izin vermektense, ufukta bir felaketin belir diği duygusu uyandırmak denenmeye değer bir yoldur.---Fennell de kendi değişim önerilerini getirmeye başladığında yo luna aynı türden engellerin çıkarıldığını gördü.

Earlier I was wondering how both the books are different? However, though they talk about Habits they are very much different from each other. The Power of Habit cites different examples from different people’s lives and has tried to explain its power. How it has brought about the biggest transformations and how it’s a behaviour we can change by constant effort. While Atomic Habits gives you multiple frameworks which you can implement to bring about a habit change. So The Power of Habit definitely gives you an inside why we do certain things the way we do and if you plan to read any of these books this should be the first one. It sets the context. Overall it’s an easy and nice read :)"
189,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9944562-pooja-kashyap,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business by Charles Duhigg is quite an impressive book. With its umpteen examples of how people defy old habits at the sake of new productive habits and eventually achieve marvelous feat is extremely inspiring. Although the book does not promote or support one secret formula for quickly changing any habit but it makes one think with a different angle. Case studies of corporate success of Alcoa, Starbucks, and P&G’s Febreeze were quite a fascinating read.Other than these, there were some takeaways for those who’d like to try Duhigg’s work.Automatic modeHabits form an integral part of human brain that is responsible for carrying out day-to-day activities. Brain is always looking for ways to save energy as a consequent of which habits emerge. The process initiates from basal ganglia of the brain, where the region looks for cues or the first timer triggers. Later when the cues are same every time, brain goes into automatic mode and thus, forms a habit cycle.Habit loopHabit loop makes us behave in a certain fashion although we might not remember the experience that led to the development of a particular habit. However, if we try to figure out how habits emerge we’d find that there are two basic tenets that is grounded in human psychology: first, simple and obvious cue or a trigger and second, the consequent reward(s).The same two rules are followed for building a new habit cycle. However, at times, there are no cues or the available cue is not sufficient to trigger the new habit loop. In such a situation, an element called craving comes into play.Craving As a matter of fact, habits create neurological cravings. Most of the times, we are unaware of these cravings. Craving is an expectation that the brain begins to show towards receiving some kind of award. Only when brain starts expected reward, loop of new habits begin.Replacing habitsThus, the cycle of habit constitutes of three elements, which are cue, routine and reward. Cue and reward are constant elements. However, routine can be re-worked to change a bad habit into productive habit. For instance, if cue is stress, routine is biting nails and reward is feeling a sense of satisfaction. If routine is changed, the nail biting habit may get curb until some extent. Like, in the same situation when stress is observed, instead of biting nails, if attention is drawn towards sketching or towards calculating multiples of any random number let’s say 9, mind will get distracted to the fresh activity. After finishing the new assignment, the same sense of satisfaction is observed. Hence, if the routine is continued during the same state of stressful situation, chances of relinquishing the bad old habit of biting nails become high.Willpower Most importantly, replacement habits become a long lasting friend if they are also accompanied by belief of believing oneself. Experts have witnessed cases where habits like addictions have been cured when the element of belief is held strong.Duhigg has done a lot of hard work in taking out gems from the fields of social psychology, clinical psychology and neuroscience for surfacing the habit formation and change. His ideas of presenting fascinating stories and case histories would surely help the readers in relating themselves every now and then. Overall, an insightful book, delving into the art of building good habits since setting high goals is not enough."

You can't skim this book.As always many concepts in this book aren't new but it is the context, the examination of success and failure - and the solutions applied - make up the core value to this book.Leaders in the time management, diet industry and money management sectors always tell us to ""write down how we spend our time, what we eat and how we spend money every single day"" and by analyzing that, then using the knowledge we can make change. They've been saying that for a long time and for many it works but it's only half the solution. We all have triggers in our life, negative and positive. We react to those daily triggers with responses that have become habit because the result is positive and pleasing. Adults don't change habits easily, many won't be able to at all because the triggers never go away and we need our positive pleasure at the end of the habit. This book teaches the reader how to understand the trigger, change the response to get the same reward. A tricky thing but there are dozens of story from live, business and history that vividly tell this tale of cause and effect.The stories make for a fascinating and practical read, it actually forces you to slow down and ingest the story and the lessons. Many of the stories really move the reader, more importantly this is a BUSINESS book that tells you why that humanity, emotion and desire for dignity is a business revenue advantage. I love that this book is free. ""Companies aren't families, they're battlefields in a civil war"". Worked at a company like that once? Me too. We needs solutions, not coping mechanisms. This book continues the focus on where neuroscience and the brain meets business strategy and marketing. I am the grocery shopping for my family - the book's tale of how we are controlled by supermarkets like rats in a capitalistic maze read like my weekly routine. It offends and impresses me how hard they are working to make me break the list I bring each week. When the author does interviews he often talks about a case study in the book where a department store did such deep data analysis they captured part of the massive baby market because they could tell a woman was pregnant before she had told ANYONE, spouse/family included. You'll leave this story realizing how much better you can serve your clients/donors if you apply this ""life cycle"" observation approach.The book's many valuable touch points on networking include a great chapter on the power of weak ties, that LinkedIn allows us to find ""people like us"" quickly in the business world is powerful. Discussing how to harness the power of peer pressure and how to make it work for you was brilliant and again, really down to earth.What you will remember about this book are the many lessons you learn from the stories...-About how the music industry uses the power of the familiar- About how athletes use the power of training to get instant response from their minds/bodies to WIN- About how businesses capture the power of keystone habits ( one small thing that affects every part of the business ) to positivity influenceIt's a fabulous read that will no doubt spark your creative mind to take a lot of notes for today and turn them into business improvement and revenue tomorrow."
191,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3789528-jane-stewart,Rating 4 out of 5,"I loved two ideas in this book. But I did not like some of his jumping around with interrupting stories.1. A woman was into drugs, alcohol, overweight, and couldn’t keep a job. After her husband left her, she decided to make one change - quit smoking. She had a purpose for quitting - to go on a desert tour. That one change started a series of changes, which resulted in exercising, losing weight, and keeping a job. Of special note were the scans of her brain. There is a section of the brain (I’ll call Area C) that is active when we crave food, drink, etc. The front of the brain (behind the forehead, I’ll call Area B) was not active for her - until she quit smoking. Area B can overpower cravings and become willpower. Area B became active when she quit smoking, as if it had been awakened, and then it started limiting other cravings as well. She began eating less and exercising more. It reminded me of something I heard about teenagers. Area B is not fully developed until the mid twenties, so teenagers take more risks prior to that time.2. Willpower is like a muscle. If you exercise, it becomes stronger. Kids who practice piano or participate in sports build willpower with daily practice and workouts. This leads to becoming better students. Going to a gym on a regular basis also builds willpower - making yourself do the workouts. Willpower is similar to muscles in another way. After using a bunch of it, you need to rest. This was demonstrated in a test with cookies. People who used their willpower to avoid eating cookies did not do as well in the second test that also required willpower.3. There is a good example in the last chapter showing how to analyze a habit in order to change it. It’s about a guy who ate a cookie every afternoon.4. The story of how things changed at the Alcoa company was fascinating.The rest of the book has many examples and stories. Several reviewers complained that the first part was good, but the rest was filler. I could see that, but I didn’t mind because most of the “filler” stories were interesting. Some I’ve heard before, but they are good stories and worth hearing a second time.My main complaint was JUMPING AROUND AND INTERRUPTING STORIES! For example: the author was talking about the bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama. I was wondering how long the boycott lasted, when the author stopped and told the story of a church. After that he went back to finish the boycott story. This happened several times. I was annoyed and impatient. When you’re telling a story, finish it, and then go to the next.AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR:Mike Chamberlain was good.DATA:Unabridged audiobook length: 10 hrs and 53 mins. Swearing language: none.

192,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/387635-sarah,Rating 2 out of 5,"Re: part, the first. I didn't really like this section for a reason that is pretty unfair to the book itself, which is that I felt like it was Behaviorism 101 with Habit graffiti all over it. I totally get that this guy had to sell this book, and it's very nice, but a cue is a discriminative stimulus, and a habit is a behavior, and a reward is a reinforcer. And I'm sad, because there would be nothing better on Earth than more people understanding contingency management! And now more people do, but less rigorously and with some fuzzy generalizations. (Also, I was like, did these animal behaviorists really say things like, ""extinguishing habits""? I would have a hard time saying that.)Re: part, the second. I think I could read a whole book about Paul O'Neill!! I found everything else to be kind of boring.Re: part, the third. What was this?? Each story in this section appeared to be completely unrelated to its stated theme, the book's topic, and/or each other. I'm never going to be annoyed to read a story about the Civil Rights Movement, but the relevance to habit formation was very weak (basically, because, similar to the first section, there is a strong literature base in this area, it's just called something completely different... because it kind of is something completely different). And then how did the gambling relate to the habits of societies?Re: the whole. I just kind of hate how these lay psychology/neuroscience books are written. I don't want to read forty long and detailed anecdotes about the same concept. I don't want descriptions of the voices and gestures of random people who are soundbited for the book. I want the whole story at once, not X, Y, X+, where X is the application of the concept, Y is another application, and X+ is what realllly was going on during X. I don't want very obvious first line hooks and last line closers. I don't want touching personal stories that cloud the science. Basically, I want to read a journal article. So yeah, not really the book's fault that I'm not the intended audience in any way. "
193,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2466409-amr,Rating 5 out of 5,"I was only 100 pages into this book when I started recommending it. Another 150 pages and I continued to recommend it. After I'm done with it, I'm here to go on the record to recommend this book. I have to admit that big part of it for me that it's the right book at the right time. Reading a book about how habits work while in the middle of trying to be more active, lose some weight and other personal projects is just a great fit.However, I still think that this is a great read and the book makes a great case about how and why do most of the things we do on daily basis. Gaining self-awareness about your good habits can make them better and more sustainable, and understanding your bad habits is the start of how you can get rid of them.The book isn't one of those books about self improvement or how to be a better person. It's just a collection of stories of people, organizations, communities applying science or just good sense to make their lives better. Even though the book contains a chapter at the very end about how to take advantage of all these stories and apply them to your life, it doesn't do that in a form of a plan or ""10-steps to better habits"". This is a big relieve for me.Sometimes the author gets a little carried away with the theory of how habits is the base of all behavior. That still doesn't take away from the book being a great read. The author is able to move easily from one story to another, give the right amount of details and keep you interested.This book doesn't really fall within my genre of books that I usually read, but I really really enjoyed it."

I heartily recommend this book to anyone who likes Malcolm Gladwell's writing. Like a Gladwell's book it's a mix of brain science, self help, business marketing,social science and business management. Filled with fresh findings and examples,I'm finding this book to be consistently interesting. An extensive footnote section show the fact checking behind the book.I'm compelled to add this snarky comment.....

I can see habits everywhere in my daily life now - routines that appear to be free will, but upon closer introspection seem ingrained and rather immutable.I've always been extremely goal-driven, and I easily adhere to ""additive"" goals, i.e. adding stuff to my routine: running two miles a day, studying Czech 30 minutes a day, etc. However, ""subtractive"" goals such as not picking my nails or not overeating at every meal are much, much harder for me. One of my friends recently commented that it's crazy that I'm so driven at certain hobbies and exercise routines, yet so unable to control myself when the dessert comes out. Habit loops baby! So, as I focus more on personal nutrition over the course of the next year, I have a concrete plan to break the habit loop of boredom = fridge after reading this book. It was a fantastic rec from a reddit forum on healthy eating - the right book at the right time. Thanks, Alexis Ohanian.As a side note, the narrator of this audiobook pronounced the word ""painstaking"" with the s stuck to the word pains instead of staking. Apparently this is the British pronunciation, and it makes way more sense than the American way. My mind was blown. My mind hadn't been this blown by lexicographical union since I learned that ""for all intents and purposes"" is not, in fact, ""for all intensive purposes."""
196,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,Rating 3 out of 5,"Pretty good--Influencer provides a lot more comprehensive framework to make change possible, but this book does have some insights that Influencer and Switch lack, such as the neurological explanation of habits, the simple habit loop model (cue, routine, reward), two other important factors in changing habits (craving and belief), the concept of organizations as bundles of institutional habits, and the three necessary elements of when societal changes occur.The three elements are: 1) a movement begins because of the social habits of friendship and the strong ties between close acquaintances; 2) it grows because of the habits of a community and the weak ties that hold neighborhoods and clans together; and 3) it endures because a movement's leaders give new habits that create a fresh sense of identity and a feeling of ownership (p.217).Some facts were interesting, too. How weak ties (acquaintances) are a powerful connecting force, how accidents and crises tend to make organizational changes easier, how a sense of control helps preserve one's willpower.But the book fails to show exactly how to make changes in habits, and so it gets the three stars.Combined with Influencer, Switch, and Change Everything, this will deepen your understanding of how change is made.

If you want to read the full review with my raw notes, check it here: https://pothix.com/powerofhabitRead this book for the first time in 2016 and re-read it now (2019). The first time I read it, I did not take notes, so I decided to ""properly read/listen"" now.I like the number of studies this book shows and how much we understand about our habits by looking at its results. Some of these studies are already debunked by science (like the marshmallow study), but it's still a great book.At the end of the book, the author provides some examples of how you can use the content of the book to apply to your habits. The goal of this book is not to give you a step-by-step guide on how to change your habits, but to show you how they work. Your cues and rewards are unique, and you have to understand yourself to deal with them.I will keep this piece of the review here. I wrote it in 2016 right after adopting my dog:I'm training a little dog now, and it's really impressive to see how we made some habits for him. It became natural for the dog to pee on a specific place, for example. The important part is to keep the same cue, routine, and reward. :)My dog is three years old now. :)"
198,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4528663-bandit,Rating 4 out of 5,"While generally I try to read nonfiction from time to time, this isn't the sort of nonfiction I'd go for, primarily because it's dangerously close to self help. So this was a pretty random selection, dictated more by circumstances than choice, but it turned out to a pretty rewarding reading experience. And while it does offer a self help guide and the general theme is about improving your life through improving your habits, it also talks extensively about fascinating real life examples (individuals and major companies) who have done just that, which was very interesting. Naturally there is plenty of psychology as well...the most fascinating part of the book to me. Duhigg writes in an easily accessible, enjoyable manner without being pedantic. He even uses himself as an example at some point. Everyone has habits, life shaping, decision informing, potentially crippling habits. This book provides an excellent perspective that can help identify and possibly change those. At the very least it's a great food for thought. At best it might improve someone's life. Either way worth a read. Recommended."
199,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"I thought this book was really bland. Once you are introduced to the cue -> routine -> reward habit cycle, the author goes full retard with primary school level anecdotes. He is persistent, if nothing else; the same point is basically told over and over - but you can often see how the story will pan out as soon as it starts anyway.Everything was presented in an annoyingly unscientific way, with little place for discourse. I could just hear the cherry-picking going on in the background while the stories were told - except when I wasn't thinking that this book must have been funded by Starbucks or something. Really, this book could have been a tenth of the size and still basically conveyed the same point. Maybe people ignorant about how the world works anno 2000 can learn something about how transparent your actions are to the powers that be (Target story), but that's it.I listened to this at 2x on audiobook and didn't feel like I missed a beat (which I think I should have given the subject). I guess Gladwell has met his match.Typical journalist-playing-psychologist. 0/10 would not read again."

Author provides a very convincing explanation on why something stays as habit while other interesting things that you might like won't. How the very same principles that work at an individual level gets applied to an organization or to the societies as a large group. This has been one of the most insightful book that I've read and would rate it even above textbooks in terms of knowledge content it delivers. The author keeps you always interested through the book and once you start a section, its very had to let go of the book without finishing. The comprehensive nature of the book makes it one of the unique ones and the exhaustive references provided helps validate the authors claims and inferences. I'd definitely recommend this book for anyone who wants to either understand the psychology behind how habits work or if you are a leader wanting to bring about a change in your organization by inculcating organizational habits to bring about positive change."

At the last part of the book, it says about ""the social habit"" which , I think, is more of sociology than psychology, especially habit. It seems like more phenomenon, I would say. The problem I don't agree in the end is that author tie all of social, psychological and decision making, behavioral thing tightening to just only habit which I don't agree with. These are separate phenomenons, I think. As the person who is interested in these subject, he uses some sort of rhetorical connections to make it interesting. After I read this book, I thought what exactly the author define habit. Because, in the book, it will totally different or distinguished, perhaps, to define the habit in the book he meant if he uses his definition and anecdotes in this book instead of separate psychological and sociological and psychiatric and neuroscience like the last part of the book. In the end, I agree some part and don't agree some parts in the book. I even checked the real scientific definition of ""habit"" after I read the book. Because, it left in the perplex."

It's a pretty interesting read in terms of information, with a few key insights that will surely help me understand my habits and actions and willpower more, as well as, hopefully, improve them.My key takeaways are:- willpower is like stamina: you'll run out if you try too many willpower requiring tasks together;- willpower can be trained;- willpower can be ""cheated"" by habits, making actions effortless;- replacing a habit best works by keeping cue and reward and replacing routine;- creating a new habit will work best if you keep the cue and rewards consistent;- identifying and implementing keystone habit in people or organisations can cause a chain reaction of goodness (how do I identify it though?);With many takeaways and a general good feeling about the book, I can't say it's a great book, as books go. Just like many other self-help ones, it's filled with useless anecdotes, endless stories to make a point long understood. I had to listen to the book at 1.5x speed just to get through it without being bored during stories.

I'm not talking Land O'Lakes cheddar; I'm talking about serious expenditure for what is basically milk curd. And then eating it. Daily. I totally sympathize with one of Duhigg's examples, a woman who gambled away nearly a million dollars and her family's house because her brain shut down when she thought about gambling or the casinos. Why? Because she'd gotten into the habit, and the triggers (boredom, the sound of slots, or the offers from the casinos, et cetera) generated a response in her that required the need for a ""reward."" I have no idea why I crave cheese - but this book offers some insight as to how I can find out and substitute some other routine that gives me a similar reward. Very commonsensical. There's some scary information in here regarding how much department stores, groceries, and Starbucks know about us. Our mass of habits makes us easy to manipulate. I thought this was eye-opening."

I felt this strongly with the power of habit. The anecdotes were good but they did not flesh out the premise of book nor did it appear that the author made enough ""statements"" to provide any substance here. The thing that this book has going for it is that most of us don't really think about our habits and how they affect business or ourselves. This book gave an excuse for the reader to mentally explore their own habits and those that govern larger organizations to which they might belong, but reading the book may not have been necessary to get there. Probably could have done it after a 3-4page convincing article. Just saying. "

I expected an emphasis on personal habits and how to change them. And while that was part of the author's message, the major focus was on advertising. The earlier part of this book told how the sellers of Pepsodent tooth paste, and later Febreez room deodorizer, used and learned to manipulate, the buying habits of the public. Later chapters dealt with how retail businesses are tracking and using data they collect about not only our habits but all our interests and how we live our lives. Some of this is so invasive, and beyond our normal awareness, that it can be alarming. The author does not come across as an alarmist, but seems to have done thorough research and just to be informing. It was certainly an informative read. "

The novel's stories varied from Michael Phelps becoming an olympian to a few medical phenomenons that were semi-interest, but not what I was in search of.The positive tips I took away from the novel are as follows: cravings drive habits, writing detailed plans & goals and then sticking to them can make them a reality, and making one small change can lead to other positive changes.

Firstly, Charles Duhigg explains what habits are and how our whole life is a simple inertia of habitual actions we make every day. Unconsciously. He also provides a framework to break some of these bad habits. The framework seems legit to me. NOW I am somehow confident it will help break some bad habits I've collected over the years. In the second part of the book he talks about how businesses use the customers' habits, the lack of habits and create new habits. As a marketer, that totally blew my mind off."

I enjoyed the author's insights on psychology and decision-making, his excellent vignettes on Alcoa, Starbucks, Proctor & Gamble, Target, etc., and his practical strategies on how to reshape one's habits and lifestyles. Habits are in charge of most of our lives, and we have to take responsibility for identifying, shaping and creating habits we want. For anyone interested in adopting good habits, dropping bad habits, or both (me) - this book is indispensable and will be of tremendous aid to you.5 stars = life-changing, powerful, a must read"

Kapağı, (alt başlığını görmeden) koca puntolarla yazılmış ismi ve ""bestseller"" oluşu, onu bildiğiniz, sıradan, ve içi kof kişisel gelişim kitaplarından biriymiş gibi algılatıyor olsa da; öncelikle bu harika bir araştırma kitabı. Kitabın sonundaki yaklaşık 90 sayfalık kaynaklar ve notlar bölümünün varlığı, birçok sözlü kaynağın kitap için oluşturulması, konunun derinlikli incelendiğini gösteren bir ipucu olabilir.

237,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/121408645-strahinja-saric,Rating 4 out of 5,"It is not just forming healthy habits. The writer is a journalist and it can be felt in his work because he mostly focuses on the personal side of the story form the perspective of people that have suffered some plight or from people that have had gained great fortune from practicing good habituation . The perspective is not scientific , it doesn't really break apart what habit is, it serves more as a complementary peace that exerts the importance of habit . I find it hard to be harsh on this book since it bears an important place in my heart it is one of the first books I've read before creating my reading habit , I remember it so clearly I had such an aversion towards reading that it took me a month to read this book , it was really slow but I kept telling myself it doesn't matter how uncomfortable it feels I'm going go read at least 5 pages every day , some day it was so bad i could only read one , I felt such great discomfort whenever I read but I saw the significance and importance of educating myself on principles I found important and on practice I considered meaningful for my personal development . When I was done with it I thought it was the best book ever , but now 3 years later I can grasp that the writing is nothing more than mediocre but the message is very significant . I see a major problem in the work. It is mentioning the formation of habits without mentioning and tying it together with steadfastness, It is not just habit that is in play , there are multiple elements , you see the whole  formation of impressions  is of vital importance,Because without a higher set up of values , aspirations desires just mere habituation can easily falter .It is naïve to think that mere habituation and enhanced knowledge of habituation can keep you away from fatly impressions .You need something much stronger than that . Firstly you have to have a pristine firm  Moral and Ethical  system in place , and thanuse that system to cast proper judgments that follow your entire frame and set up . It is as well substantial for your values and aspirations  have to be crystal clear . Your head has to be Fort Knox .Firstly your Ethics and Morals are your bedrock , your foundation , once you have them properly set up than you can start casting proper judgement ,than once you orient yourself properly you can set up proper aspirations and goals , that is your meaning , that makes your life meaningful . I gave a short rudimentary perspective on the topic , but if you want to read a more complete coverage this is the perspective of Epictetus .Every habit and faculty is formed or strengthened by thecorresponding act – walking makes you walk better, running makesyou a better runner. If you want to be literate, read, if you wantto be a painter, paint. Go a month without reading, occupied withsomething else, and you’ll see what the result is. And if you’relaid up a mere ten days, when you get up and try to walk anydistance you’ll find your legs barely able to support you. So ifyou like doing something, do it regularly; if you don’t like doingsomething, make a habit of doing something different. The same goes for moral inclinations. When you get angry,you should know that you aren’t guilty of an isolated lapse, you’ve.encouraged a trend and thrown fuel on the fire. When you can’tresist sex with someone, don’t think of it as a temporary setback;you’ve fed your weakness and made it harder to uproot. It isinevitable that continuous behaviour of any one kind is going toinstil new habits and tendencies, while steadily confirming old ones. And as philosophers point out, this, of course, is how moralinfirmities develop also. If you are seized by greed on someoccasion, reason can be invoked to alert you to the danger. Then thepassion will abate and the mind will be restored to its formerbalance. But if you don’t bring anything by way of relief, themind will not return to normal; when it’s inflamed by animpression, it will yield to passion more quickly the next time. Keepit up, and the mind grows inured to vice; eventually the love ofmoney is entrenched. When someone contracts smallpox, if helives he is not the same as he was before the illness, unless therecovery is complete. It’s the same with the passions of thesoul; they leave certain scars and blisters behind. And unless youremove them well, the next time you’re flogged on the same spotthose blisters will be open wounds.So if you don’t want to be cantankerous, don’t feed yourtemper, or multiply incidents of anger. Suppress the first impulse tobe angry, then begin to count the days on which you don’t get mad.‘I used to be angry every day, then only every other day, thenevery third…’ If you resist it a whole month, offer God a sacrifice,because the vice begins to weaken from day one, until it is wipedout altogether. I didn’t lose my temper this day, or the next,and not for two, then three months in succession.’ If you can saythat, you are now in excellent health, believe me.Today, when I saw a good-looking girl, I didn’t say to myself,‘It would be nice to sleep with her,’ or ‘Her husband’s one luckyguy.’ Because that’s tantamount to saying, ‘Anyone would be luckyto sleep with her, even in adultery. Nor do I fantasize aboutwhat comes next – the woman undressing in front of me, thenjoining me in bed. I pat myself on the back and say, ‘Welldone, Epictetus, you’ve solved a devilishly difficult problem, muchharder than the Master Argument itself. But if the woman iswilling, if she calls to me or gives me a nod, if she takes me by thearm, and begins to rub up against me – and still I overcome my lust– well, that’s a test far harder than the Liar paradox, it even beatsthe Quiescent. That’s the sort of thing to boast about – notpropounding the Master.So how does one get there? Start by wanting to pleaseyourself, for a change, and appear worthy in the eyes of God. Desireto become pure, and, once pure, you will be at ease with yourself,and comfortable in the company of God. Then, as Plato said,when a dangerous impression confronts you, go and expiate thegods with sacrifice, go to the temples to supplicate the gods forprotection. It will even do to socialize with men of goodcharacter, in order to model your life on theirs, whether you choosesomeone living or someone from the past.Consider Socrates; look how he lay next to Alcibiades andmerely teased him about his youthful beauty. Think how proud hemust have been to have won that victory over himself – an Olympicsizedvictory, and one worthy of a successor to Heracles; so, really,he’s the one who deserves to be addressed, ‘Greetings, hero’ – notthese grimy boxers and pankratiasts or gladiators, their currentcounterparts.With these thoughts to defend you, you should triumph overany impression and not be dragged away. Don’t let the force ofthe impression when first it hits you knock you off your feet; justsay to it, ‘Hold on a moment; let me see who you are and what yourepresent. Let me put you to the test.’ Next, don’t let it pull you inby picturing to yourself the pleasures that await you. Otherwise it will lead you by the nose wherever it wants. Oppose itwith some good and honourable thought, and put the dirty one toroute. Practise this regularly, and you’ll see what shoulders,what muscles, what stamina you acquire. Today people care only foracademic discussion, nothing beyond that. But I’m presentingto you the real athlete, namely the one training to face off againstthe most formidable of impressions.Steady now, poor man, don’t let impressions sweep you off yourfeet. It’s a great battle, and God’s work. It’s a fight forautonomy, freedom, happiness and peace. Remember God, askhim to be your helper and protector, as sailors pray to the Dioscurifor help in a storm. Is there any storm greater than the storm offorceful impressions that can put reason to flight? What is a realstorm except just another impression? Put away the fear ofdeath, and however much thunder and lightning you have to face,you will find the mind capable of remaining calm and composedregardless. If you lose the struggle once, but insist that next time it willbe different, then repeat the same routine – be sure that in the endyou will be in so sad and weakened a condition that you won’t evenrealize your mistakes, you’ll begin to rationalize your misbehaviour.You will be living testimony to Hesiod’s verse:‘Make a bad beginning and you’ll contend with troubles ever after."

E si badi bene, non si tratta soltanto di smettere di fumare o bere alcol, oppure acquisire la costanza di svolgere attività fisica o evitare lo junk food: quella stessa forza di volontà potrebbe cambiare radicalmente la nostra esistenza (come se poi le cose non fossero collegate....), alea permettendo, beninteso.Ora, il guaio risiede nell'individuare queste routine, i segnali che le innescano e le gratificazioni inconsce che ci spingono ad adottarle: più facile a dirsi che a farsi, almeno nella stragrande maggioranza dei casi. L' autore di questo libro ci fornisce delle indicazioni, delle linee guida su come individuare il circolo delle abitudini e ci illustra esempi concreti su come esse costituiscano la base, oltre che della vita quotidiana dei singoli individui, anche delle organizzazioni aziendali, delle imprese, nonché della stessa società, e come cambiare alcune di esse (le cosiddette ""abitudini chiave"") può spesso costituire la agognata svolta.Ah, scordatevi delle ricette facili, leggere questo libro non è altro che una presa di consapevolezza dell'esistenza di questi meccanismi e non vuol essere altro che un catalizzatore per coloro che decidono di analizzare criticamente le proprie routine e prendere in mano la propria vita.Si perchè, in ultima analisi, dipende tutto da noi."

Cravings.According to the author, we all have the power to change our habits through adjusting the routine to something more productive in order to achieve the desire reward. It sounds so simple, but really takes conscious effort, practice, patience, and persistence. I really enjoyed listening to the author narrate the audiobook and I think I was able to pick up some useful tips to become more productive and less destructive in the pursuit of my goals.

(p. 61)""The Golden Rule of Habit Change: You can't extinguish a bad habit, you can only change it."" (p. 63)""We know that a habit cannot be eradicated - it must, instead, be replaced. And we know that habits are most malleable when the Golden Rule of habit change is applied: If we keep the same cue and the same reward, a new routine can be inserted.""

(p. 202)""On a playground, peer pressure is dangerous. In adult life, it's how business gets done and communities self-organize."" (p. 225)""Habits are not as simple as they appear. As I've tried to demonstrate throughout this book, habits - even once they are rooted in our minds - aren't destiny. We can choose our habits, once we know how. Everything we know about habits, from neurologists studying amnesiacs and organizations experts remaking companies, is that any of them can be changed, if you understand how they function.""

241,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/159505573-rana-this-city-that-book,Rating 4 out of 5,"In this book, the author Duhigg explores the science behind habits and how we can modify them. He starts by exploring how habits are formed and introduces the concept of a habit loop that consists of a cue, a routine and a reward – all of which is supported by scientific and neurological research. The book is filled with real-life stories and case studies that illustrate the power of habits in various aspects of life, from personal habits to organizational routines. Duhigg also discusses how habits can be transformed by understanding and manipulating the habit loop.One of the key takeaways from the book is that habits can be changed with awareness and deliberate effort. By identifying cues and rewards and substituting new routines, individuals and organizations can break free from unproductive habits and establish more beneficial ones. As a marketeer, I especially liked the “commercial” stories shared throughout the book and how the science is used to influence our buying behaviors. I highly recommend this book if you would like to get out of a vicious habit loop or would like to understand your behavior, and that of others, better. "

Not all of them were success stories, but also neither this book is a self help book. It is a book about our everyday life force - habits. And this book was a real discovery for me. In simple words and flow explained habit cycle (cue -> routine + craving -> reward) was strengthened by a short real stories and experiments. And that's it - no multiple ideas, no bullshit success stories. Just a single idea, it's proof and even step by step explanation how to apply it by yourself (noting that it will be hard) ."

Journalists are too good at picking and writing convincing anecdotes that make me believe narratives that aren't supported in the science. And despite seeing that Duhigg is a journalist, I still read and enjoyed it.The cue was the title and premise of a popular psychology book with a self-help undertone (though the second half turns towards a smattering of organizational anecdotes that are less obviously related to habits). I gobbled up the ideas because it fit the routine: each chapter had a simple idea (e.g. the golden rule of habit change, willpower is a muscle) with two anecdotes that support it. And then I got the reward of feeling smarter and better able to improve my life through better habits. Though it's probably more of a near-miss since I haven't had a chance to apply it to my life.Dang. I think reading this book was a habit."

I didn't like that it would start with one story, and then it would start two more, and then would go back to the first story. Yet that was probably the best way to keep my interest, so that’s a plus. I can’t say I’ll change my habits now because I know myself, nonetheless, it made me think more about them and how to dissect them."

But, when you flip the pages, you encounter a well-written, well-researched and well-thought-out psychological analysis on human behaviour that goes beyond the realm of our personal life to the corporate world. A decade down the line and the book is still as relevant as it was when it was first published and it will still be a decade to come, and this due to the timeless percepts Charles shares. "

That may be the case but sadly the exhileration goes no further. Duhigg uses long, detailed, real-life examples to illustrate how adopting habits can help people win Olympic medals and how consciously breaking habits can help people lose weight or turn their company around.

The compelling stories he presents to make his case are:•	How and why Target can tell which of its female customers are pregnant, even before they have told their friends and family; •	How Rick Warren went from a depressed minister of a small congregation to the leader of one of the biggest mega-churches in the world; •	Why Rosa Parks’s refusal to give up her seat started a movement when similar refusals by others had not; •	Why a 1987 fire in a London Underground station failed to be contained, leading to the deaths of 31 people. •	What Michael Phelps did that helped him win the 8 Gold Medals – even on the day of the race when his goggles got filled with moisture and he could not see anything•	What incredible thing Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz did for his company•	What National Football League Coach Tony Dungy changed to turn around the fortunes of a dying team •	How Procter & Gamble’s Febreze failed and then became a success story.•	How the Rhode Island Hospital changed a culture completely after one of its doctors ignorance resulted in a patients death. •	How Paul O’Neil of the Aluminum Company of America confused and quizzed the world by transforming a loss incurring company to a mega profitable organization by doing the unthinkable – Changing the habits by focusing on worker safety. Finally, he gives us a contrast between two stories, one of man who killed his wife while sleepwalking; the other of a woman who became addicted to gambling -- and how jurors ultimately found the man innocent and the woman guilty -- and why. Those two stories are the bottom line on the book -- what you can change, and what you cannot.Overall CommentsDuhigg reminds us that business processes and routines are nothing more than habits practiced on an organization-wide scale. If you can get your kids to brush their teeth every night, you can get your employees to provide great customer service and you can change and transform any habit you are addicted to.This is indeed a book that deserves a standing ovation for it Brilliance, Beauty and Boldness. I loved it! If you liked Freaknomics (Steven Levitt & Stephen J. Dubner), Blink, The Outliners, What the Dog Saw & Tipping Point (Malcolm Gladwell), then this is a book you must read.Overall Rating10 out of 10.Loy MachedoLoymachedo.com"
262,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7309374-rowosthlm,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a dual review of two books about habit. Habits are important things in one’s life and there are numerous books on the subject. The classic book, a must read, is The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey. Another two popular books about habits are The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg and Atomic Habits by James Clear, that came out very recently. Having read all three of them I combined my notes for the last two in this post. No matter what stage in life you are, it is always good to review one’s habits and behaviour – these books provide a good framework for doing it.One of the habits I’m struggling with is to get rid of the reading of self-help books. Thus, reading The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg and parallelly Atomic Habits by James Clear became a sort of a meta enterprise. Would these self-help books about habits help me to get rid of the habit of reading self-help books? There’s nothing wrong with the self-help genre per se. I believe, everybody should strive to become a better version of themselves. Evidently, there’s a lot of great wisdom in this type of books – many prominent figured refer to them when they tell the story of their success. However, having read tons of them, one would usually circle around the same known stuff and shabby ideas wrapped in different narratives and supported by different anecdotes. The trick here is to know when to stop and, actually, go out and do something by using the knowledge and inspiration gained.My own habit of falling back to self-help books is, obviously, grounded in the alluring products of the habit loop driven by the craving for knowledge on self-improvement. We can use the basic members of the habit loop – cue, routine, and reward – well covered in the Duhigg’s book and analyse the situation with the reading of self-help books. For this type of products, the cues (triggers) are everywhere, and who can ignore the wish for excellence? Then, the routine is easily carried out – the messages in those books are straightforward that doesn’t require a very deep thinking and reading between the lines. It just assumes the acceptance in many cases, and, finally, the reward is instant – the feeling of getting something very valuable – a digested wisdom and not seldom a bit of inspiration. It can be compared to junk food (which by the way is almost gone from my life thanks to this kind of books). However, my point is not to pick on this genre, but rather to stress the importance of not getting stuck in it, as in my previous point. Habit as a phenomena humans and other living creatures are equipped with is one of my favourite subjects. I strongly believe, in the end, habits defines us and our destiny. The subject of habit covers several interesting areas as neuroscience, biology, psychology, and more. The basic mechanics of habit system can be described through the theory of operand conditioning, a term coined by B.F. Skinner back in 1930. It is a technique of learning that occurs through reward and punishment for behaviour. Through operand conditioning, an individual makes an association between a behaviour and a consequence. A relatively simple feedback loop forming habits of an individual can be described in terms of drive, stimulus, response, reward with different kind of reinforcers – positive or negative. What was lacking in the model of operand conditioning was other influencers like feelings, thoughts, and, very importantly – beliefs. Moreover, human behaviour is so complex that factors as the environment and group psychology are of crucial importance when it comes to the habit science. Modern behavioural science takes these terms into account and they are very important in the habit theory. The authors of both books did a great job addressing these factors in their respective methodologies.Based on the early theory of operand conditioning, different models around habits and behaviour (in my interpretation, behaviour is a series of actions evoked by habits) are developed and fundamental terms are just called different names. Charles Duhigg in The Power of Habit grounds his model on the habit loop consisting of cue-routine-reward parameters which are driven by craving. James Clear in Atomic Habits suggests his model consisting of four steps called cue, craving, response, and reward. These factors are systematically analysed by respective author and the steps how to build good habits and remove the bad ones based on these models are suggested. In both books I found some valuable and interesting points as well as good tips on how to keep one’s habits on the right track.As one can see from the parameters in each model, there’s a difference in the arrangement of them making some differences in application of the methodologies of habit treatment. Duhigg sees the term craving as a driving force for the members in the habit loop – cue, routine, reward. Clear suggests that craving is simply a second stage in his model of habit. This is the main difference, and I need to admit I haven’t put enough time to analyse which model is right – both make sense. We would need some deeper diving in relevant disciplines and get help from ontology of the actual things here. Anyhow, I tend to believe that a craving lies above cue, routine, and reward. Cues alone without craving are meaningless. Nevertheless, both models are very useful for working on one’s habits. Duhigg argues that the way of changing or replacing of habit is to focus on the routine parameter, or the response part according to the terminology or Clear. Clear gives a lot of examples on how the cue and reward steps can be worked on. I completely agree that even these parts can be influenced, whereas Duhigg argues that the most important thing is to focus on routine leaving cues and rewards unchanged. I believe, we can remove unwanted triggers. Like making the tempting things like candies hard to reach and out of sight, etc. This has been well researched in a very interesting work by Richard H. Thaler for which he was awarded the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2017. Then, we can reprogram our brain to think about rewards differently – change the mode of them or reinforce the distant rewards requiring immediate sacrifice by some direct reward. Clear has a lot of good examples how to do it.Habit should be seen as one of the essential parts forming an individual. A brilliant quote by Margaret Thatcher shows the operational importance of habits: “Watch your thoughts, for they will become actions. Watch your actions, for they'll become... habits. Watch your habits for they will forge your character. Watch your character, for it will make your destiny.” If we put those terms it in a different order, we can see that habits are very important, perhaps more important than one’s thoughts, because they are operational tools defining which actions one will take and what destiny those actions will form.In summary, if you are somehow unsatisfied with any of your habits and would like to actively and effectively change them and thus become an individual you’d like to be, I strongly recommend both books. I would read The Power of Habit book first, this book is longer, has more stories, and has more research behind it. Atomic Habits book is easier to get through, especially after reading Duhigg’s book. Both books, as you might have guessed, are clear, easy to read and grasp. They will give you the right mindset to approach your behaviour and provide valuable tools to shape your personality."

I'LL DO IT!, thought I. What's more, I'll do it as an ebook on my iPad and I'll figure out how to start buying ebooks from the Tattered Cover. It's incredibly easy, by the way.It struck my fancy because I've been reading a fair amount about behavioral economics (you know, that radical idea that you can better predict how humans will behave if you study their behavior) and this sorta fit with that. It's basically a self help book, though. (I think the last line of the book was something like: ""You now know how to swim."")It covers a bunch of topics--some of which were more engaging than others. The bit about how Target using your buying patterns to accurately predict whether or not you're pregnant was cool and freaky. I felt so much gratitude and appreciation and curiosity for AA all over again, highlighted here for its behavioral therapy group sessions. The bit about the army major who prevents riots by keeping food vendor out of a public square was very interesting.My biggest complaint about this book is that he very rarely gets into the nitty-gritty of whatever it is he's describing. Even for something as simple as those little cue-action-reward diagrams that pop up all over the book, he waits until the appendix to really explain it (and I would recommend that anyone reading it start with that). There are heaps of end notes referring us off to scholarly articles--which is good but also a bit maddening. I would've loved to see more info about AA's twelve steps. Or read in more detail about how that woman got to be better at money. Or found out more about those habit patterns the army major mentioned.Still, totally enjoyable read. Reading on the iPad does not make you sleepy, but that's not the book's fault. I took down a few notes to look into some of those articles, and I made notes of those cue-action-reward steps. I'll be thinking about this book for awhile."
264,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7205156-oana-sipos,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Power of Habit is an easy to read and practical book. Being interested in changing some habits, it did meet my expectations on how to proceed to do so. Moreover, it presents real cases and very interesting situations of how habits have been changed. As mentioned in the book ""habits can be changed, if we understand how they work.""The most important aspects to keep in mind are:1. The habit loop :: cue --> routine --> reward. The cue is that trigger that makes our brain go into automatic mode and also which habit to use. The next step is going into the routine loop (which can be physical, mental or emotional). Then comes the reward which is what tells your brain if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future.Over time, the loop becomes more and more automatic and a new habit (good or bad) is born. Important to keep in mind is that ""when a new habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making.""2. How to create new habits :: (simple) cue --> (new) routine --> (clear) reward""To change a new habit, you must keep the old cue, and deliver the old reward, but insert a new routine. Almost any behavior can be transformed if the cue and reward stay the same.""'The truth is, the brain can be reprogrammed. You just have to be deliberate about it.""Other interesting citations:- ""Foaming is a huge reward, said Sinclair the brand manager. Shampoo doesn't have to foam, but we add foaming chemicals because people expect it each time they wash their hair. There's no cleaning benefit, but people feel better when there's a bunch of suds around their mouth.""- ""There's something really powerful about groups and shared experiences. People might be skeptical about their ability to change if they're by themselves, but a group will convince them to suspend disbelief. A community creates belief.""- ""Willpower isn't just a skill. It's a muscle, like the muscle in your arms or legs, and it gets tired as it works harder, so there's less power left over for other things.""If you're in doubts, I'd say ""go for it"" ;)"

266,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3056629-jenn-jr,Rating 4 out of 5,"A colleague recommended this book to me - and I was pretty surprised at how much I enjoyed it! Charles Duhigg is an engaging writer, the book flows really well. Some chapters alternate stories to provide long-form examples along similar concepts which works well in most cases. The stories of individuals with injuries, addictions or even night terrors are juxtaposed against organizations and communities -- all demonstrating how habits can be individual or group. It's interesting note how much participation in a group or community can have on habits -- as well as creating a ""belief"" to improve the habits of a group (company, team, community).There was a fair amount of data on things such as weight loss and cutting out smoking or alcohol. The story of Alcoholics Anonymous was really fascinating. The story of ""Febreze"" was really interesting to me - esp since I have heard of the stuff and never used it thinking it was just another gimmicky air freshener. After reading about how it works - I am surprised that they had so much trouble marketing it! The story of the turnaround of ALCOA to a ""safety first"" company and the effect that had across the entire organization was also extremely interesting.The basic idea is this: identify the cue, the routine and the reward for your habit. If you find you are snacking, pay attention to what you are doing when you feel motivated to go get that snack to determine the cue. After you had your snack - think about what you feel and what you're getting out of the exercise of getting a snack. Then - figure out a substitute. A lot of people struggle with long days in the office and mid afternoon is a time when people often need a distraction. So a walk to the cafeteria or kitchen to get a snack - when all you really needed was a chat, a walk around the block or five minutes of meditation. It all begins with identifying the situation and the reward -- then you can change your habit, and maybe one day win the Super Bowl. Or something. Great book - check it out!"
267,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24428233-anna,Rating 4 out of 5,"Although I wouldn't classify everything Duhigg writes about as ""habits,"" he told some very excellent stories about patterns of behavior, routines, social movements, addictions and neurological disorders in persuasive detail and context. He set out to write a book about what he considered repeated behaviors and defined all of them as habitual -- pounding that point home by cramming every concept into a neat ""cue, routine, reward"" patterned diagram. I appreciate what he was trying to do here. I enjoyed reading about such diverse examples as Starbucks' and Alcoa's changing company cultures -- and the individuals who made that happen, as well as its impact on employees, the civil rights movement, sleep terrors and personal habits -- -- but the subjects got to be disparate as the book went on. I think he should have renamed the book something along the lines of ""Thinking Behaviors: How Routines Evolve for Individuals, Companies and Society,"" or something like that. Maybe a title like that isn't snappy and attention-grabbing enough, but it would have been more accurate. I dunno.I just couldn't quite go along with his discussions of sleep terror murder, the founding of Rick Warren's Saddleback Church and gambling addiction as all under the same umbrella as ""habits."" He also injected a paragraph praising the Obama administration's implementing the stimulus package and healthcare reform way back when as good leadership in a ""crisis,"" then offering no follow-up as to how they were monumental failures that caused far more harm than good.These narrative flaws aside, he makes a good point that repeated routines -- whatever you want to call them -- can be changed and manipulated for the better in our lives, our professional lives and in society.I feel like I should point out how much I loved the chapter on Tony Dunge and the Colts and Buccaneers (given where I'm from, maybe that's not a surprise!).

The rest of the book lagged, but that is likely because I am not the target audience. This would have been a really good series of articles. In my opinion, best anecdotes supporting The Golden Rule of Habit change were about Tony Dungy's coaching. ""Belief is easier when it occurs within a community."" Habits at the corporate level were very interesting as well, Starbucks has the corner market there too. Their proactive teaching about how employees are to respond at inflection points - pressure situations -- was clutch. Made me want to think through the pressure points of my days and think through the best response. Loved the LATTE approach to communication - listen, acknowledge, take action, thank, explain. Howard Schultz's mother's questions of him at school resonated with me, ""What are you doing tomorrow? How do you know you're ready?"" Training kids to set goals and know how to proceed to achieve them. You can't extinguish a bad habit but you can change it. How we change habits should have been in the book not an appendix. 1) Identify the Routine. 2) Experiment with Rewards. 3) Isolate the cue.(Location, time, emotional state, other people, preceding action) In the sociological portion of the book I thought Rick Warren's mention was interesting, ""If you try to scare people into following Christ's example, it's not going to work for too long. The only way you get people to take responsibility for their spiritual maturity is to teach them the habits of faith. Once that happens, they become self-feeders. People follow Christ not because you've led them there but because it's who they are."""

Do not expect deep scientific analyses and interpretation of our brains' neurological functions, as the Author is an investigative journalist and not a scientist. That being said, the book is based on real science experiments/test/analyses which the author presents in a very lively and engaging manner. I personally felt, that it had enough science for me to grasp what habits are, how they are formed and how to change them...These were the first three chapters of the book ( my favorite ones) and probably the biggest part of the book that i will take for myself. Do not expect a rich literary language and stylistics accents. This is not the focus or the benefit of this book. Why I loved this book, is the reason it went beyond discussing habits on a personal level. It went on about keystone habits in organizations and how they can be altered through a crisis or cleverly administered policies. This will prove to be very interesting for those who manage their own businesses and is a reminder that organizations are run by people who bring in their habits. However, at this parts I was hoping to get more tools from the author and deeper analyses, which is not present in the book. The parts about Football were quiet boring to read...probably it will be more interesting for a fan. I feel there was no need to go into such great lengths to illustrate the point. The great part about the book is that it did not limit the notion of habits to an individual but dissected it and presented along a spectrum of broad magnitudes, objects and cases relevant to an individual, company, organization, social movement etc. It definitely rises interest in going into all these subjects one by one at a greater depth.

Когато знаеш нещо как се създава и функционира, е много по-лесно да предприемеш действия да го промениш. Друг момент, който много ми допадна, е че авторът по никакъв начин не захаросва нищо - няма лесен начин да се промениш, изисква много работа на принципа проба-грешка, но не е невъзможно. Написал си го е черно на бяло, без да ти продава безсмислени надъхващи думи. Ясно и точно ти обяснява, че не е лесно, че изисква работа, че може и реално никога да не успееш, но това не значи, че не е невъзможно. Харесвам го този човек за това. :) Накрая, някои от изследванията, за които прочетох, си признавам, че сериозно ме стреснаха и ме втрещиха.

Наистина имаше някои обезпокоителни моменти от проучванията и изследванията, за които пише, до степен, че почвам сериозно да се замислям до колко нещата, които правя са навици, които сама съм си създала, или нечия маркетинг стратегия ме е докопала просто.

First of all, Duhigg himself is awesome. Let's just get that out there. So I may have gone into reading this book with a bit of a bias.Secondly, as a psych academic, I know we're not supposed to like ""pop psych"" books. And admittedly, some are better than others. But I really think that this is one that actually gets it right! He talks about research in a way that is accessible yet completely accurate; every time he would be discussing research and I'd say something to myself like, ""Man, this sounds exactly like implementation intentions, I wish he would talk about implementation intentions,"" lo and behold, I checked the appendix and he was citing about research on implementation intentions! He was just talking about it in a super accessible way, so I didn't realize that was what he was doing.Thirdly, I feel like sometimes these ""pop research"" books will start with a theme...and then get a little off course. You can tell that the author found out a bunch of stuff while researching that he/she had spent so much time reading about, he/she could no longer realize that the topic material wasn't quite relevant to the central theme and didn't really belong in the book. I think that Duhigg does one of the best jobs I've seen of really tying EVERYTHING back to habits, and not going off course. There was only one minor part where I remember thinking it was a bit of a stretch (though I can't remember what that part was now...), and it still came back to habits in the end."

Moreover, the book has a past paced and vivid writing style which made everything comprehensible.The only thing I didn't like about this book is that it could've have been a bit shorter.

274,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4901672-debra-hamel,Rating 5 out of 5,"A 2006 Duke University study found that some forty percent of what we do every day is habit. That is, we don't make decisions every day about how we're going to, say, brush our teeth--which hand to hold the brush in, when to turn on the water, how long to brush. It's a routine that we consciously settled on at some point, but it has long since become automatic, something we do without thinking, a habit. This is good, because if we had to make decisions about every single action we take in our lives every day, it would be paralyzing, and we would have no time to think about more interesting stuff. So it's vital that our lives are filled with these routines, these habit loops, although the habits themselves, of course, can be either good or bad. In The Power of Habit Charles Duhigg talks about the habits of individuals, businesses, and societies, using examples of each to show how habits work for good or ill in real life. He discusses, for example, how Starbucks instills willpower in its workers by inculcating good habits, how Target profiles its customers based on their habitual purchases, how the new CEO of Alcoa turned the company around by focusing on the institution's habits related to worker safety. The most interesting part of the book, however, is Duhigg's discussion of how habits work, how they can be created, and how bad habits can, with work, be reprogrammed. It's really a fascinating read."

Thanks to neurological science, advertisers can now guarantee sales of fruit juice to preconditioned monkeys.Give any primate (or suitable rodent) the proper cues, rewards, and routines, and its habits will change.People can be reprogrammed because they are not fundamentally different from computers or other machines.Even god is a tool for change: spirituality seems to be one of the keys to AA's success, at least.The possibility that someone might desire the good and not be able to attain it (Rom. 7:15), even given the secret key of the power of habit, doesn't seem to occur to Mr. Duhigg. If you don't have the willpower to change your habits, you just need to do some more willpower exercises. (And what if you don't have enough willpower to do the willpower exercises...?)The most profound portion of the book came at the end, where he compared a mom's compulsive gambling to a murder someone committed while sleepwalking. He probed the questions of moral responsibility inherent in these two tragic stories. But the appendix confirmed what the book was: a well-written (I definitely give him that), anecdote-laden, pop-psychology sermon for the more intellectually rigorous among the self-help crowd.

Cu toate acestea, cartea conține mai multă teorie în jurul acestui subiect decât observațiile mele, teorie bazată pe nenumărate studii ștințiifce și experimente. O obișnuință este o buclă formată din trei elemente: ”the cue”, comportamentul și răsplata. Odată identificat acest ”cue” poți înlocui obișnuința distructivă cu una constructivă și, foarte important, trebuie să îți oferi o răsplată pentru a înrădăcina obiceiul.Un astfel de loop devine cu adevărat o obișnuință automată în momentul în care râvnești răsplata. În acest moment partea din creier numită ”basal ganglia”, care se regăsește în toate vertebratele, intră în acțiune și declanșează obiceiul ca pe un automatism fără ajutorul părților din creier responsabile cu procesele superioare de gândire. Aceasta înseamnă că după un timp nu mai e nevoie de niciun efort de gândire sau de luare a deciziilor, ”the cue” e suficient pentru a declanșa comportamentul dorit (sau nedorit, în cele mai multe cazuri). Negreșit o carte pragmatică din care se pot extrage strategii importante pentru cei ce doresc o schimbare. În aceeași măsură, însă, este o carte foarte ușor de citit, căci Duhigg prezintă nenumărate cazuri într-un stil epic care îți dă impresia că citești un roman."
277,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1335442-charlane,Rating 4 out of 5,"I enjoyed Duhigg's perspective. He states the real power of habit is the insight that our habits are what we choose them to be. Once that choice occurs - and becomes automatic - it's not only real, it starts to seem inevitable. He presents research and shares examples of powerful organizations that have brought about change by replacing one habit with a more desirable habit. The sociological nerd in me thoroughly enjoyed Part Three: The Habits of Societies. Throughout the book, I often found myself thinking of Nelson Mandela. I thought of Mandela because he is a perfect example of how habits create the world one inhabits. As Mandela was imprisoned for 27 years, his habitual thinking of himself and his surroundings created the world he inhabited. The oppressive setting did not create his world, his power of habit created his world. Though not mentioned in the book, I admire Mandela even more after this reading and I am encouraged to continue believing in the power of habit. There is a delicacy and a beauty to a habit. A delicacy we must identify and believe with a beauty of choice and reality. William James wrote about habit and said it is ""the thing that bears us irresistibly toward our destiny..."". "

I thought the part about individuals was packaged quite well. The organizational habits section was an eye opener and most definitely not for conspiracy theorists. What Target (the store chain) does to track people is disturbing (I wonder what my Guest ID is in their monster database), but all the more interesting to me because whatever they think they are doing fails with me - I never think of Target as a place to shop. Oh, I do shop there, but I see them as more expensive than their competitors. Anyway, the bar dropped significantly in the last section on societies. I thought he was reaching a bit with his stories.A few good references to studies and a LOT of anecdotes. If you don't have time to read the whole book, go for the first couple of chapters and the appendix (a method for changing personal habits) - the rest is fluff; not bad, but still fluff. (Note: each chapter covers at least two story lines, and Duhigg breaks them up as one would a television drama that uses flashback. I thought the connections for a few of them were a little tenuous, but the flow might take some a bit aback.)"

Some may argue that it uses too many stories to drive its point home, but I'd say I remember everything in the book BECAUSE of the stories.The book establishes the part of the brain that stores the habits and explains how the habits are recorded in our brains and as a result control certain behaviors. It goes on to establish that a habit is consisted of three distinct parts: A queue (something that triggers the habit), a routine (which is the action that is resulted from the queue and leads to the next part) and a reward (the feeling of satisfaction you get when your routine leads to a certain result). The book states that habits can be changed but never erased. The only way to change a habit is by identifying it's queue and reward and trying to change them while the routine remains the same. Some examples are given in this regard.In its latter part, the book explores the concept of social habit which is interesting but less practical than the earlier parts of the book.The Power of Habit belongs to my favorites list only because it added a new insight to my life. One which I can identify with and is completely in keeping with many other books I've read on other subjects. A recommended read indeed."

It is neither a how-to book, although anyone who reads it will automatically inventory their own habits - physical, emotional, intellectual - which make up the VAST majority of behavior, nor is it a dense neuroscience-brain book. It’s an engaging read with lots of well-summarized research and case studies about what is going on in the brain when we opt for sitting on the couch rather than going for a run. Turns out, we have a lot in common with rats. Charles Duhigg, New York Times reporter, covers personal habits, the habits of societies and social movements (eg: why did Rosa Parks lead to the Montgomery Bus Boycott - believe it or not, social habits are involved) and the neuroscience of free will. Best news: habits can be broken, but you need to identify the cue and the reward to change the routine. Willpower is a muscle that needs to be exercised.

Duhigg gives various examples of the habits of individuals, organisations and society, with anecdotes that I found fascinating. Furthermore, by understanding the basis of habits in our lives, he gives us the keys to substituting our bad habits with good ones - he empowers us to change. All we need to do, is the work of identifying our habits and intentionally modifying them in our lives. We cannot escape habits, but must learn to use and shape them to our advantage. "

""Once a small win has been accomplished, forces are set in motion that favor another small win."" ""Small wins have enormous power, an influence disproportionate to the accomplishments of the victories themselves.""You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.

Even if you don't have bad habits you are trying to change, you'll probably think of things that you are doing without thinking (i.e.habitual behaviors) that you don't need to do or are doing in a less efficient way.I got a lot out of it while reading it, and I was taking notes throughout. The first parts explain the reasoning behind habits, in a very clear and easy to understand way. I had so many moments of ""duh"" - things that seem like they should be obvious, but we just don't think of them that way. The end was more of an ""action"" oriented chapter. It was really clear and prescriptive of the steps the author recommends that you take, things that he did. He says that is just that, and that everything will be very personal, but his method seems very straightforward and easy, if a little time-consuming."

For me, one takeaway from here was that if I use the same cue and reward, I can update the routine and change the habit. Also, belief is a key ingredient.What I liked the most, however, were all the examples and experiments that encompass 3/4 of the book. I found it amazing that McDonald's make all their stores look the same so that everything is a consisting cue to trigger eating routines or the Rosa Park story and how social habits of friendship along with the power of weak ties played such a key part in the civil rights movement."

299,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/807377-jon,Rating 4 out of 5,"One key takeaway, of many:It's important to develop a habit of belief. Duhigg talks about how scholars are puzzled by the success of Alcoholics Anonymous despite the fact that it doesn't seem to be grounded in any sort of physiological science. Duhigg posits that AA is successful because it inspires habits of belief: people meet each week to hear stories from people who have kicked their bad habits, and they confirm their belief in a higher power. These habits of belief inspire long-term change."

329,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26030644-matt-hutson,Rating 5 out of 5,"You probably have no idea how your habit started or how you can stop it. The Power of Habit will tell you not only how it started, but also how to change your habit.The Power of Habit blew me away. And I know I'm not the only one. So many people recommended this book years before I decided to buy it. Boy, I wish I would have read it a lot earlier in my life since there are so many takeaways you'll learn about how to change your habit. You'll definitely want to hear them, and I'm going to give them to you in this post.First, let's start with what you all probably want to know, and that is the four steps which will help you to change an unwanted habit. Change Your Habit Step 1: Identify the RoutineEach one of you has a routine you do every day. In fact, you probably have several routines which could be as simple as brushing your teeth and taking a shower right after you wake up (I hope you do that routine regardless). This is what researchers define as a habit, and it's the first step in realizing how you are going to change your habit if you want to.The author uses an example of going to get a cookie every day during a break time (routine) or very close to the end of the day at work. Why is this a bad habit? Well, the author said it made him gain quite a bit of weight in a relatively short amount of time according to his wife.The next question you'll probably want to ask yourself is (using the cookie example still):1. 'What's the cue or cause of wanting to eat a cookie every day during a break or close to the end of the day?'2. 'What kind of reward do I get from eating the cookie?'3. 'Is it the cookie itself, or maybe the socializing with coworkers at the canteen?'In order to figure that out, you must do a little experimenting with rewards.Change Your Habit Step 2: Experiment With RewardsAdjust your routine so it delivers a different reward (reward). This is the biggest key you need in order to change your habit especially if it's a habit which might harm your body or mind such as smoking or your weight gain.The suggestion from the book is to try a few different rewards day after day while recording the time, location, action (reward) and the feeling you receive after finishing.By experimenting with different rewards you can actually pinpoint what it is you're actually craving which in turn will make it much easier to change your habit.However, not all habits are easy to break so that's where determination plays a big role. Don't forget to take notes after each session that way later you can go back to look at the notes.The author discovered it was actually his need for social interaction that drove his desire to go to the canteen and munch on a cookie, not the cookie itself.Change Your Habit Step 3: Isolate the CueA cue is the thing that happens right before your habitual routine starts. On your way home it might be the bent tree which signifies to turn right. In the author's case, it was his need for temporary distraction from work by socializing which cued his habit to go buy a cookie. Identifying categories of behaviors ahead of time to scrutinize in order to see patterns is the key to finding the cue to your habit.locationtimeemotional stateother people around youimmediately preceding actionOnce you go through a few rounds of taking notes of these things you should be able to figure out what your cue is. Change Your Habit Step 4: Have a PlanWhen I see CUE, I will do ROUTINE in order to get a REWARD. You should write out a plan and set an alarm every day as a reminder to change your habit routine. The CUE and REWARD should stay approximately the same. That's important to remember.In the case of the author, he wrote down 'At 3:30, every day, I will walk to a friend's desk and talk for 10 minutes.' He set his alarm and made sure he stuck to his plan. If no one was around, he would go take a walk, or go to the canteen and get a healthy snack, like an apple, while chatting with his coworkers.Changing some other habits may be much more difficult but by actually figuring out what triggers your routine and what the reward is you have now gained the power to change your habit for the better. Things That Make The Power of Habit Stand OutStorytellingThis book wasn't just like reading some boring nonfiction book. What made this nonfiction book unique from others is Charles Duhigg's ability to tell a story. I can remember on two occasions, one actually shedding a tear from the heart-jerking story, and another where I cringed at the grotesque description.This is the power of storytelling at its best. IllustrationsThe illustrations are simple yet effective. It's nice to have some visual print in a book, no matter how simple. Keystone HabitsThere's more than just one reason why you might want to change your habit. A Keystone Habit is a habit that will start a chain reaction of other good habits. For some people, as shown in the book, Keystone Habits have changed their entire life.If the four steps of changing your habit and learning about Keystone Habits were the only two things you took away from this book, it's worth the time it takes to read the whole book.Parts of the Book Which Help You to Understand How to Change Your Habit. Part I: The first section focuses on how habits emerge within individual lives.The first part of the books helps you to understand what the author calls the 'habit loop'. This is the essential part of understanding how you create habits.Duhigg, the author, does a great job of putting these scientific and psychological facts into an easily understandable format of stories.  If it weren't for the stories The Power of Habit would be extremely boring for most people.In the first part of the book, you'll understand the 'habit loop' through stories from people such as a man named Eugene, who lost almost all of his memory in an accident, Claude C. Hopkins, who helped Pepsodent, and so many other household products become part of our daily habits (now I know the tingling feeling and foam when brushing my teeth actually don't make my teeth any cleaner. It's part of the 'reward'), users of Fabreze, Tony Dungy, head coach of The Buccaneers in the late 1990's, and Alcoholics Anonymous.Each story has meaning and ties in with the next part of the book.Part II: The second part focuses on the habits of successful companies and organizations.Once a small win has been accomplished, forces are set in motion that favor another small win. They fuel transformative changes by leveraging tiny advantages into patterns that convince people that bigger achievements are within reach.How do companies use habits to become successful?Before 1987, Alcoa was known as a company with one of the highest rates of injury in the US, until they hired a new CEO named Paul O'Neil. O'Neil believed in the power of 'Keystone Habits' and by focusing on the safety of his workers it would influence 'ALL' other areas of work such as productivity, communication, and sense of unity as a company.He was right. Just by implementing 'safety' protocols it created a snowball effect which improved all other areas of Alcoa. It even sparked up new ideas from workers lower on the totem pole as well.Ways to Create a Keystone Habit in a Company to Encourage Positive Change:Small wins are incremental progress points on your way to your main goal.Create a structure to help form all your other habits.Create company cultures where new values become ingrained.(Each link goes to a specific article about the specific topic of the parts of Keystone Habits)Part III: The third part looks at habits of societies.I really loved reading this section of the book partly because it relates heavily to marketing and a way to get your content or product to go viral. By understanding the three keys to start a social habit or movement you'll be far ahead of your competitors who may not have read this review or the book.The three keys are:1. A movement starts because of the social habits of friendship and strong ties between close acquaintances.2. It grows because of the habits of a community, and the weak ties that hold neighborhoods or groups together.3. And it endures because a movement's leaders give participants new habits that create a fresh sense of identity and feeling of ownership.Now here I highly recommend reading The Tipping Point which I reviewed because there's a major part of that book which discusses what Gladwell calls 'connectors'. If you understand the power of weak ties (great article) and 'connectors' put together it can be a very powerful set of marketing tools.The Power of Habit uses the story of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King, Jr. as the way of explaining strong and weak ties. I felt like it was the best story Duhigg could have picked. It worked out perfectly.When the strong ties of friendship and weak ties of peer pressure merge, they create incredible momentum. That's when widespread social change can begin.Final Thoughts on How You Can Change Your HabitThe Power of Habit is probably the most profound nonfiction book I've read in the last year. It is a book perfectly filled with the 'right' stories to match the message. I believe Duhigg carefully put his heart, soul, and belief into this book.Do you have the power to change your habit?According to this book you do.""Once we choose who we want to be, people grow to the way in which they have been exercised, just as a sheet of paper or a coat, once creased or folded, tends to fall forever afterward into the same identical folds. If you believe you can change-if you make it a habit-the change becomes real.""It's been great having you here today and I'm happy you made it all the way to the end of the review. I'd greatly appreciate your support in my cause of spreading the importance of gaining knowledge through reading by sharing this review with your friends. You can also make this world a better place by reading this book for yourself. I know that sounds cheesy, but it's true. By growing your intelligence, you're making this world a better place, one person at a time. Spread this message and you will be helping to make an impact.Learn how to control and change your habit for the better.Read My Other Reviews at http://bookmattic.com"
