0,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47207032-chelsea-humphrey,Rating 5 out of 5,"I'm sure anyone who has either read this book or heard anything about it by now realizes this is a huge departure for Backman from his usual tale. About a month ago I was recording a podcast with the lovely Anne Bogel and one of the recommendations she gave me was to read Beartown. While we all know Backman for his uplifting fiction that is both touching and emotional, this was described to me as ""a serious, heavy read that lacked his whimsical trademark"". There are few things I love more than reading a book that is wholly different than what an author is known for, so I knew I had to pick this one up quickly and see what all the fuss was about. When Sam from Clues and Reviews suggested a buddy read I knew that time had come (SPOILER ALERT-SHE LOVED IT TOO). I'm so glad that I picked this up when I did; I'm currently in major book hangover mode and can't seem to settle in with another story until I work through my feelings on this one. Bare with me as this review will be long winded.
""It's only a game. It only resolves tiny, insignificant things. Such as who gets validation. Who gets listened to. It allocates power and draws boundaries and turns some people into stars and others into spectators. That's all.""
Hockey has never been my thing. I grew up in the deep south where football is praised more highly than any other sport, but baseball was where my friends and I found ourselves watching games in high school. Most of my guy friends were on the team, and I remember the awe inspiring excitement we felt at every win and the crushing agony of each loss. I attended a small private school that wasn't known for it's ability to crush it's opponents in sports, but during my high school years we had an exceptionally good baseball team (2 of our players ended up playing professionally years later). It was difficult for our school to get behind the idea of team spirit and to fan the flame of hope when we were crushed in each game season after season, but I remember the anticipation that began to grow amongst the student body those years. This experience is what allowed me to fully succumb to the excitement of the hockey scenes in this story. Hockey is a large piece of this book and I'd go as far as suggesting that hockey is it's own character in the novel, but it wasn't from an overly technical point of view. I found that the overall plot and the hockey scenes awoke that same feeling I used to have while watching high school baseball and it brought to life a sport I never dreamed I could become entranced by. I think Backman said it best when he wrote ""Hockey is like faith. Religion is something between you and other people; it's full of interpretations and theories and opinions. But faith... that's just between you and God. It's what you feel in your chest when the referee glides out to the center circle between two players, when you hear the sticks strike each other and see the black disk fall between them. Then it's just between you and hockey. Because cherry trees always smell of cherry trees, whereas money smells of nothing.""
""A great deal is expected of anyone who's been given a lot.""
 This seems to be the central theme surrounding the book. There are a great deal of characters in this novel; the ever-changing and growing cast seems to add multidimensional aspects to the story that cause it to leap off the page and bury deep into your mind. There were certain characters and views that I was naturally more drawn to (i.e. Amat, Benji, and Kira), yet I found each tongue necessary in the overall narrative to give the clearest picture; this also caused myself to question my knee-jerk reactions and judgements I dropped along the way. In an attempt to not spoil anything for future readers, I'll just state that the content is heavy and much darker than a traditional Backman story, but it still holds that magical quality where you seem to be watching the exchanges and thoughts happening from just outside the realm of reason. There is nothing in this tale that hasn't been written before, but the way in which it is told was especially unique and the subject matter is timely and necessary.
""If you are honest, people may deceive you. Be honest anyway.If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfishness. Be kind anyway.All the good you do today will be forgotten by others tomorrow.Do good anyway.""
The above is just a fraction of the wisdom handed down from Amat's mother, and I highly recommend picking up a copy just to read the rest, but my purpose for posting above is to clarify how this sums up the moral of the story. Even with all the injustice surrounding the evil act committed in this novel, there are consistently small glimmers of hope. Please do not misunderstand; this is not a happy go lucky book. There are no feel good finishing pages, although there is still that seed of sunlight planted. What I found separated this from being just another depressing story was the shining examples of forgiveness. There are many examples of diversity on all ends of the spectrum included in this story as well, and the author has woven them through in such a way where it doesn't feel forced or awkward; there is nothing screaming ""Look at me! Look at how diverse my characters are! Please pat me on the back for simply including them!"" No, these characters were infused with a subtle realism that caused me to take a step back after turning the final page and bask in the awe I felt from what Backman created with this book. While I could ramble on for days, I'd rather stop here and highly suggest that you pick up your own copy and experience first hand the sheer brilliance of Beartown. This book wrecked me; it pulverized my soul and made me realize how easy it would be for this story to come to life. Highly, HIGHLY recommended for anyone willing to give this novel a fair shot. I'm not sure this story, nor these characters, will ever fully leave my consciousness, and I simply cannot wait to experience whatever Backman choses to craft next.************************************Oh my lord. If you need me, I'll be wallowing in a giant puddle of all my feelings and emotions. Someone hold me.  I was planning on just doing a mini review on this one but I feel a long winded breakdown coming on this weekend. This will likely be one of my top reads of the year. üíîüíîüíîüíîüíî"
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35794399-rowan,Rating 4 out of 5,"My first Fredrik Backman read ‚Äì and now I understand the hype! Never have I read a book with such well-developed characters and strong sense of place. Backman made me feel like a resident of Beartown, the cold small town surrounded by forest, whose very existence depends on hockey. I came to know these people and deeply care for them. This book will occupy my mind for days to come.I enjoyed his writing style and ability to elicit a wide range of emotions ‚Äì one minute he could make my eyes well-up, heat-rate increase; the next have me laughing out loud, or pausing to reflect on a meaningful passage. After a somewhat slow, yet steady start, it quickly demands your attention and is hard to put down.‚ÄúSometimes it feels as if the people of Beartown love the fact that the climate is so inhospitable, because not everyone can handle it: that reminds them of their own strength and resilience.‚ÄùThis story is about much more than hockey. It depicts toxic masculinity, peer-pressure, rape culture and silence, homophobia, small town issues, and much more. It‚Äôs impossible not to reflect on your values and integrity as such issues are explored. Some parts reflected my own experiences playing sport as a teenager ‚Äì reminding me why I replaced sport altogether by sixteen.Many fellow Australians haven‚Äôt seen snow or played a hockey game ‚Äì yet Beartown can be easily transplanted here. It‚Äôs universal. Beartown itself is one of the most well-written characters. Perhaps the book‚Äôs greatest strength is that you‚Äôre made to feel passionately about each person. You might love them (Amat, Fatima, Benji, Ramona) or loathe them (Kevin and family, Maggan Lyt). Each individual has their battles and secrets, and I felt very invested in the likes of Amat and his hardworking mother, Fatima.‚ÄúIt takes her thirty seconds to realize what she‚Äôs looking at. Then she claps her hands to her face and weeps. A boy training with the junior team, a head shorter than all the others. Her boy. Her back has never been straighter. She could run a thousand miles.‚ÄùWe come to know these characters on such an intimate level, you can‚Äôt help but feel they‚Äôre real. Aspects are inevitably going to resonate. While I also admired Ramona, owner of the Bearskin, I particularly loved the character of Benji too. ‚ÄúHis eyes always let you know that he could leave you any moment if he felt like it, without so much as a backward glance. He isn‚Äôt tied to anything, he just doesn‚Äôt care.‚ÄùBeartown managed to motivate and inspire, while other times anger and frustrate ‚Äì but I was always engrossed and engaged. The impending sense of doom was palpable and culminated in a powerful ending. This book is full of heart and well-deserving of the accolades. I‚Äôm already looking forward to reading more of the series. Books stay with us for various reasons and in the case of Beartown - there are plenty.‚ÄúThis place has a way of grabbing hold of your insides that‚Äôs hard to explain.‚Äù Thank you to my dear friend, Tracy, who gifted me this book ‚Äì all the way from Canada! I appreciate you and our friendship as much as Beartown appreciates the sound of a puck hitting the back of the net."
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16384209-candace,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow!--Just, wow! Every once in a while you stumble upon a book that takes you by surprise, becoming far more meaningful than you ever anticipated. 'Beartown' is precisely that type of book. Bravo, Mr. Backman! When 'Beartown' first started showing up on so many of my friends' feeds, I was mildly curious. Not being a sports fan, by any stretch of the imagination, I filed it away in the back of my mind in the ""maybe one day"" category. Knowing only that it centered on a junior hockey team in a small town, I had envisioned something akin to 'The Mighty Ducks' played out on paper.However, as the 5-star reviews kept rolling in, I grew increasingly interested. I had to see what all the buzz was about. After all, there's no way that 'The Mighty Ducks' would stir up that type of a response. So, I downloaded the Audible version and bumped it to the top of my audiobook TBR list. It proved to be the best decision I could have made. This book was phenomenal!'Beartown' started a little slow for me. With so many characters, it was hard to keep everyone straight at first. Yet, it crept up on me slowly. Before I knew it, I was completely engrossed in the lives of these characters and the small town dynamics. I couldn't pull myself away from it. 'Beartown' is the type of book that tempts you to play sick and call-in to work so that you can keep reading/listening. I became completely engrossed in this story as it unfolded.Beartown is like many small towns across the globe. The decline of industry and tourism has wreaked havoc on this small town's economy. Only in Beartown, the hopes and dreams of an entire community are pinned on the success of a junior hockey team. These teen boys are treated like celebrities and the weight of the world is on their shoulders. Parents, business sponsors, booster club members and a variety of other individuals all contribute to this high-pressure environment. Morality and justice take a back seat to winning. Nothing is more important than hockey. With a robust cast of characters, the viewpoints offered in 'Beartown' are diverse. The relationships are rich and enlightening. Everything weaves together to make a complex web, with hockey at the center. Events are inter-connected and this book explores the ripple-effect of actions.More than anything else, 'Beartown' forces readers to evaluate their values and take a look in the mirror. It tackles some very difficult content and serves as a reminder of the hazards of blind idolization. From peer pressure, to homophobia, to rape culture, to personal integrity, this book forces readers to take a candid look at problems that plague all societies. This book was an emotional rollercoaster. At times, I felt inspired. Other times I was absolutely outraged. It made me feel joyful and also sad. You name it and I felt it at some point while listening to 'Beartown'. It was the type of book that moves you.Without a doubt, I would recommend 'Beartown' to everyone. It is definitely one that has made it's mark on me, like only the best books do. The narration was also extremely well done and really made for a pleasurable listening experience.Check out more of my reviews at www.bookaddicthaven.com"
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2947323-dianne,Rating 3 out of 5,"I'm the outlier again, I guess. I DID like this but didn't love it as many readers clearly did. Backman certainly has a gift for developing characters that feel real and for creating atmosphere, but I didn't love the narrative structure he uses here. He has a large cast of rotating characters and each character has a brief mini story arc that often (too often for me) concludes with the equivalent of a Jack Handey ""Deep Thought"" or a grave pronouncement that is contrived to make you nod knowingly at the author's wisdom. Honestly, I don't do well with ""folksy"" books and this is one of those varmints.I did like very much the ice hockey setting and the Swedish forest where Beartown is set. I liked the plot and the characters, I just didn't care for how it was packaged and delivered. A little too close to cheesy for my cold, dead, cynical heart."
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10171516-jessica,Rating 5 out of 5,"i still have yet to read a book that so beautifully and realistically captures what it means to be human better than this story. and i will forever have love for the boy with sad eyes and a wild heart. <3_________________________now THIS is how you tell a story. the writing is definitely the strength of this book and it makes me wish i was fluent in swedish, because i know it would be an even more remarkable story in its native/original language (if thats even possible). reading this book feels as if fredrik backman has invited me into his home, made me a cup of tea, and sat next to me as he tells me a story that comes straight from his heart. you can tell so much love went into writing this, because only someone who loves people could write about them this beautifully and this honestly. my heart is so full.‚Ü† 5 stars"

Has it ever just lived inside of you every single day, day in day out, since the moment you first read it? You take a breath and a character comes to mind and you feel what he feels? For me, ‚ÄúBeartown‚Äù is that book and the character of Benji Ovich is that guy. He rips my heart wide open and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever loved a character more. Fredrik Backman, you‚Äôve wrecked me!! ‚ÄúBeartown‚Äù and ‚ÄúUs Against You‚Äù have turn me into a complete sobbing mess.. For that, I thank you. I love your characters and the way you intertwine the storylines and make everyone equally important. Benji, Amat, Bobo and Ramona and oh so many others, you have my heart. This re-read was shared with my book-buddy Kaceey. It was such an honor to read this with you Kaceey - I was so scared to read this with you, afraid that you wouldn‚Äôt love the characters as much as I do, but I am so grateful that you loved them too!Original review: 5 Resounding Stars!Fredrik Backman: You‚Äôve left me drained, almost completely bereft of words. This is a novel, unlike any of your others, yet it‚Äôs so full of heart and emotion that we the readers know emphatically that it is yours. And after the last words have sunk into my soul, I can emphatically say, thank you! This one is to be treasured.Now, what can I possibly say about this story, without giving it away?Beartown is a town that eats, sleeps and goes to bed thinking about one thing: Hockey. Hockey is what makes this town tick. Vibrate. Come Alive. Beartown, and its residents wouldn‚Äôt be a community without it. Every person, every family pins their hearts on the Junior Boy‚Äôs Hockey team and its inhabitants have nothing left. It‚Äôs a huge cross for these kids to bear (no pun intended) and sometimes, well, something or someone has to break. Sadly, strength and resilience give way to anger and pain, leaving no stone unturned, yet that little bear inside those who've been dealt the most blows, refuses to give up.Whether or not you like Hockey, I can almost assure you that it will grow on you after reading this. And if you know someone who plays? Well, you will understand the drive and the desire better than a lot of us. But the raw human emotion that is dripping from each and every page of this novel? You will all feel that. Fredrik Backman evokes it from each and every reader and here, he does so in a way that he has never done before.  And I am truly honored and extremely grateful to have experienced it. A huge thank you to NetGalley, Atria Books and the amazing Fredrik Backman for giving me this ARC in exchange for an honest review. It has been a privilege.Published on NetGalley and Goodreads on 2/16/17.**Will be published on Amazon on 4/25/17."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma,Rating 2 out of 5,"nothing could have convinced me i would like this book. then my friend mentioned liking it 1 time and suddenly i believed i would fall in love with it.sorry to my friend but i should've stuck with the first thing.i have absolutely no idea what this book was trying to say.this is kind of insane even on the surface, because this book is 432 pages long and has a pretty simple subject: Bad Thing Happens In Hockey Town.it's even more insane when you consider that conservatively 50% of this book is made up of truisms. ""Because that's what friendship is"" to finish a chapter. ""You never stop being a parent"" in the middle of a paragraph. ""Every day can mark a minute or a lifetime depending on who you spend it with"" as a dramatic start to a scene that is all of 2 pages long and in truth has nothing more original or significant in it than that.for a book with so much to say about friendship and violence and love and community and family and hockey, i came away feeling like it'd said very little at all. bottom line: this is a book of mugs."

8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,Rating 5 out of 5,"""For people who have never lived where darkness and cold are the norm, where else is the exception, it is hard to understand that it is possible to find someone who has frozen to death with their jacket open, or even naked. But when you get really cold your blood-vessels contract and your heart does all it can to stop blood reaching the frozen parts of your body and then coming back to your heart cold. Not unlike a hockey team suffering a penalty and playing at a numerical disadvantage:prioritize resources, play defensively, defend the heart, lungs and brain. What happens when the defense finally collapses, when you get cold enough, is that your box play falls apart, your goalie does something stupid, your backs stop communicating with each other, and the body parts that were previously shut off from circulation are suddenly switched back on again. And then, when warm blood from your heart flows back to your frozen feet and hands, you experience an intense rush of heat. That's why you suddenly imagine that you're overheating and start to take your clothes off. Then the chilled blood goes back to your heart and it's all over. Every couple of years or so, someone in Beartown goes home drunk after a party and takes a shortcut across the ice, or gets lost in the forest, or sits down to rest for a moment, and is found lifeless in a snowdrift the following morning"". Hockey is more than just a game in the 'Beartown'....it's the focus of the community's small town universe. Everyone is affected.....The game itself requires sacrifice -- long training sessions for the kids - Dedication from coaches, ( old school and new school thoughts of best way to train young kids) , wives, children, and friends of the team are aware they live in HOCKEY TOWN. -- The General manager works long hours --- even when he is home. Hockey distraction pulls him away from the family. The President of the club pulls weight and adds pressure. The Board of directors and sponsors try to pull power ranks in hiring and firing.Fanatical parents can get nasty, and competitive with other parents. Teachers have a hard time demanding respect in their classroom from their students who are star athletes. Educators are influenced by wealthy community members. Store and bar owners contribute to the town at large.Friends and family in the community are aware of the type of town they live in. It's very clear! Hockey is a family member in and of itself!! There are personal & team struggles - on and off the ice: Parties - alcohol- drugs- sex - rape - lies - cool kids - fat kids- lonely kids - rich and poor kids - kids trying to fit in - love - loss - lies - betrayal - secrets - death - financial strains- forgiveness, marriage and family issues - loneliness- friendships - jealousy - anger - loyalty - admiration- inspiring relationships- and not so inspiring. There is the challenge of the economy of the town itself and the expectation- hopes and dreams that a junior hockey team might have to boast the towns economy. Factory workers who have lost jobs may get re-hired. Tourism may increase. Beartown would be held in higher regard. ......For a player like Benji -- whose father committed suicide when he was little - hockey gave him a context, a structure, rules, and it rewarded him with the best sides of himself: his boundless heart and unshakeable loyalty. It provided a focus for his energy, channeling it into something constructive. All through his childhood he would sleep with his hockey stick beside him. ......Having buried a father and son within a year period, being the General Manager of the junior Hockey team gave Peter Andersson the feeling of keeping something alive. His wife Kira, a lawyer, who commuted to work just outside of Beartown, thought less of the over zealous hockey obsessive hockey community. She loved her husband but never really understood why the game made grown men a bag of nerves. Their daughter Maya, 15 years old, enjoyed playing her guitar. We will embrace her pain and feel her anger as her story develops. Her best friend Ana spent the night at her house almost every night. This friendship puzzled me for awhile as to why she never slept at her own house - but made sense as the story continued. Leo, 12 years old, the son of the Andersson family shares his dad's passion for Hockey like most of the town. Easy going kid. .......Star hockey player Kevin Erdahl, good grades, from a prominent family, had guys scrambling for best friend position- ( which was usually Benji), and girls throwing themselves at him. The only people that weren't 'pudding-at-his-feet' were his parents. Kevin's parents were the wealthy family in town - they financially sponsored the hockey team - high achievers- result oriented- but emotionally distant. Kevin may have had the most natural talent on the team - but he had other handicaps. David and Sune - both hockey coaches argued about whether a 17-year-old could be ready to play in the A-team. Sune-- the older coach lived by the traditional team motto for years...since the beginning of the club: .....""Culture, Values, Community"". The worn old banner hung in the locker room. David, the younger coach knew he could never really properly explain, that the true drive for a star player like Kevin had nothing to do with values - culture or community....but...... ""his absolute desire to win. Not that he hates losing, but that he can't even begin to conceive of trying to accept not winning. He's merciless. You can't teach that.""  David believed ""hockey has always been that the world outside the rink mustn't encroach upon the world inside it. They need to be separate universes. Outside, real life is complicated and frightening and hard, but inside the rink it is straightforward and comprehensible. If David hadn't kept the world so clearly divided, these guys, with all the shit they've had to deal with out in the real world, would've been broken even as little kids. But the rink was a refuge. Their one happy place"". Amat, the youngest player - the fastest, who played with heart, stepped up a level, lived with his single mother. He's the guy who would naturally gather up pucks and cones after practice. Not because anyone told him to because it gave him a chance to avoid others. When it came to talking about girls, parties, or boasting about snorts-of-coke or blowjobs, Amat was reluctant to join in the laughter..... yet that overwhelming feeling of being allowed to belong was something he wanted too. The warm feeling to 'belong' was a strong attraction. As you can see - many themes get covered. Each of the characters are so well developed- I feel like I know them - as people. I know this town. The strengths - weakness - the sadness - the sport! For many years my next door neighbor played for The San Jose Sharks. His wife and and 5 kids too. Ice Hockey is a popular sport in San Jose because of the Sharks. Our younger daughter was a huge fan -knowing every team members name - and many team members. - so from the basic beauty of the sport - including the tunnel vision quest for competitive excellence, scores, statistics, and victories....I enjoyed the subject- vehicle - in which Fredrik Backman told this story. I felt that Backman brought a remarkable voice to the world of 'training-dedication'. . be it Hockey, dance, music, or martial arts.......competitor or simply an enthusiast. This book is compulsively intimate providing different perspectives - different stories illuminating the benefits of any skill training - the challenges- for all those who are involved.... ""Bear Town"" in this case! THE BEST PART: Deeply EMOTIONALLY FELT!!! 'DEEPLY'!!! You can read a thousand reviews- NONE OF THEM WILL BE SPOILERS- ( enjoy them all), because this novel is an 'experience-on-steroids'. MUST BE EXPERIENCED yourself! -- gorgeous insightful prose!! Thank You Netgalley, Atria Books, and Fredrik Backman"

But we know the difference between good and evil.""Fredrik Backman is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. His characters and storytelling are practically perfect. I can easily recommend this book to anyone.There are so many different facets to this book. Questions of morality and loyalty, passion over logic, and right vs wrong. No path through the story is easy and no solution obvious. The background story of every character is perfectly developed and important in the fine tapestry the Backman weaves. You may be surprised to discover that a story about a little hockey town far away can make you think about how you approach life in general. One final bit of awesomeness about this book. With some books you may reach the end having found one or two really great quotes. Well, when you read this, be prepared with a highlighter, page flags, etc. as almost every page has a fantastic quote that is worth remembering after the story is done. Honestly, truthfully, literally . . . Backman is good, REALLY good!"

Read this one for TCE Book Club!

 Everyone has a thousand wishes before a tragedy, but just one afterward.
Beartown, a small town in the middle of the forest, has been on its way out for years. Businesses are leaving, layoffs are happening and people are fleeing for anywhere but there.But, there is one thing that holds everyone together - the junior ice hockey team. People may say that it's crazy to pin all your hopes and dreams on a hockey team, but they don't understand.
Never trust people who don't have something in their lives that they love beyond all reason.
Beartown is a hockey town.For the first time in thirty years, Beartown has a real chance. They're about to compete in the national semi-finals. Sponsors are (finally) taking an interest in funding the club. If the Beartown Bears can win - 
it could mean everything
 - a professional training center, a shopping mall, business flooding back to the once-abandoned town.All of their hopes, and dreams, and fears, rest on a few teenage shoulders:Kevin - the best player their town has seen in years.Benji - the best coordinator and team player.Amat - the fastest player that has ever graced the ice.And it seems simple, the team just has to win the finals and all their (and the town's) wildest dreams will come true. All that changes in an instant. Maya, the daughter of the General Manager of the Beartown hockey team, is raped by one of the team's star players and the whole town is thrown into turmoil.
She‚Äôs fifteen, above the age of consent, and he‚Äôs seventeen, but he‚Äôs still ‚Äúthe boy‚Äù in every conversation. She‚Äôs ‚Äúthe young woman‚Äù
She's covered in bruises, and he's the star of the team. With little-to-no evidence, the town has to decide what to believe, and no matter what they decide
, something will be irrevocably ruined. 
Whew. This one was an absolute roller coaster for me and that was (in part) due to the way Backman set it up. The first third-or-so focuses exclusively on setting the scene - what the town stands for, how much the hockey team practiced and practiced, how Maya begrudgingly loves hockey because her GM dad does, and so on.It felt like one of those underdog-sports-stories and I was loving it. There was some hint at a future tragedy, but it wasn't too overt (in my opinion).Thus, when the rape scene happens and the entire book's premise does a 180, I was shocked and disappointed. I was actually super into watching these boys pull up the town and succeed in the hockey world and when the book flipped, I was devastated. I'm really, really not into rape books. That's, in part, because I've read so many books that use it as a cheap plot device that I'm absolutely sick of reading about it. I actively avoid books about rape as much as possible.I put it down and couldn't read it for days.But, this was a TCE Book Club book...so I picked it up again and slowly got back into the story.
Another morning comes. It always does. Time always moves at the same rate, only feelings have different speeds. Every day can mark a whole lifetime or a single heartbeat, depending on who you spend it with. 
And Backman really does the rape justice (and I know, that sounds weird).He humanizes and demonizes it, he brings it into being in a way that I haven't read before. The way the cast of characters react and the way others distance themselves made the story come alive. It was incredible to read.
You never have the sort of friends you have when you‚Äôre fifteen ever again. Even if you keep them for the rest of your life, it‚Äôs never the same as it was then.
It truly was amazing, and I'm so happy I kept with it. I honestly think I will continue the series - the writing was that good.That being said, I really did not appreciate the way the book went about introducing the concept, but the rest of it more than makes up for it.Audiobook CommentsNot my favorite audio - the reader (Marin Ireland) did not do that great of a job. The characters were often indistinct (an ""angry"" voice was consistent between Maya, her teenage best friend and her dad) and the reading was so slow. So. Incredibly. Slow. In addition, I had issues with the way the CD's were divided. On a CD player, roughly every chapter was a new 'track'...which was an issue considering they were 10-20 minutes long. I would've preferred shorter tracks, which makes pausing and finding your spot significantly easier.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads"

BUT WHAT IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO TAKE AWAY THE ONLY THING THEY PASSIONATELY LOVE?When Maya confesses the abuse she‚Äôs endured, the balances hold the town together destroys because the rising star of the hockey team is responsible of this violent action and Maya‚Äôs father (mostly his team‚Äôs needs are his priority. He neglected his family, drifting apart with his own wife because of his job that absorbs the rest of his energy) needs to decide between his team and his daughter.  There are so many amazing, realistic, relatable characters will always have a special place in my heart and on my mind: Bobo, Benji, Amat, and of course Ramona. All of them push themselves so hard to find their places in the team, society, friends circle but they struggle for their differences. Those differences can be sexual choices, race and fat-shaming! But the town has its own wild, savage nature kills its own residents‚Äô soul because of the hard life conditions, competitiveness, struggles to stay alive!STUNNING, RIVETING, HEART WRENCHING, SHOCKING, IMPECCABLE WRITING, MEMORABLE, POIGNANT STORY SHAKE YOU TO THE CORES WITH ITS NATURAL, SIMPLE, REALISTIC, LOVEABLE CHARACTERS!!! This author has so much talent, achieving to make you feel all those different feelings at the same time. I felt RAGE, DESPERATION, PURE HATE, LONELINESS, PASSION, AMBITION, VICTIMIZATION, EXHAUSTION, LOVE, JOY and SADNESS! He left me in an emotional turmoil! Beartown will always have a place at my all-time ten best favorite books. It‚Äôs about family values, hypocrisy, friendship, neighborhood, collective hatred, struggling to find your way in the world.  Some books shape your lives and push your out of your comfort zone to question your dignity, your beliefs and finally help to remember who you are! This is one of those precious books I never get tired to read over and over again!"
12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h,Rating 5 out of 5,"Here's a little bit of a confession: while I really enjoyed Fredrik Backman's book 
A Man Called Ove
, and the charming curmudgeon who was its main character, I have found in recent years that there seems to be a glut of charming yet misunderstood curmudgeons doddering their way through modern fiction.So despite people's warm feelings about Backman's next two books, I passed, because I have enough to worry about becoming a (hopefully) charming curmudgeon someday soon. However, I did pounce on his novella 
And Every Morning the Way Home Gets Longer and Longer
, and I fell in love with it (curmudgeon-ish character and all), and it easily found its way onto my list of the best books I read last year.Even with full confidence in Backman's storytelling ability, I was surprised to learn his newest book, 
Beartown
, didn't follow the same pattern of his other books, but rather focused on a small town which many think is dying out, a town literally obsessed with hockey. I wondered how this would work. But then as I read this book over the course of one late evening in the throes of insomnia, I was blown away, because this was so much more than a hockey novel. Backman pulled off a colossal feat, a literary mic drop.



Beartown is a small forest town that seems to be getting subsumed by the trees around it. One of the few highlights of Beartown is an old hockey rink which was for many years home to the only pastime enjoyed by the factory workers who lived there and the townspeople who cheered with and jeered at them. ""Sometimes the entire community feels like a philosophical experiment: If a town falls in the forest but no one hears it, does it matter at all?""But even for a hockey-obsessed town, the excitement is becoming nearly too much to bear. Beartown's junior ice hockey team is about to compete in the national semifinals, and many in town think they're going to win. The team may be good, but their star player, Kevin, is exceptional, and thanks to his best friend and defender (both on the rink and off), Benji, he's even better. The outcome of the game has the potential to change many lives‚Äîthe players, including a new player brought on to the team unexpectedly; the general manager, once a hometown hero who briefly dallied in the NFL; several of the club's coaches, who have differing ideas about what coaches are supposed to do; even town leaders, who see the bright horizon a win could bring.Despite what happens in that game, one night everything changes. An incident, an accusation, cause sides to be taken, lines to be drawn, people to show their true colors, friendships to strengthen and/or wither. Suddenly Beartown isn't sure what it is or should be‚Äîshould hockey and its players come first? Is that all that matters? Do the haves get, while the have-nots suffer?Backman has written an outstanding, emotional, thought-provoking novel about so much more than a town and a game. It's a book about the responsibilities and burdens of parenthood and the ripple effects missteps in parenting can cause; it's a book about belonging, about finally feeling a part of something when you've spent so much time on the outside looking in; it's a book about the staggering power‚Äîpositive and negative‚Äîof friendship; and it's a book about the toll keeping secrets can have on you.It's funny, I was thinking I would get a Swedish 
Friday Night Lights
 but instead found so much more. Backman once again proves he is a writer to be reckoned with, and I'll let him lead me wherever he wants to go next time. No questions asked.NetGalley and Atria Books provided me an advance copy of the book in exchange for an unbiased review.

13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69106439-virginia-ronan-herondale,Rating 5 out of 5,"‚ÄùLate one evening towards the end of March, a teenager picked up a double-barrelled shotgun, walked into the forest, put the gun to someone else‚Äôs forehead, and pulled the trigger.This is the story of how we got there.‚ÄùWHAT AN OPENING LINE!!!WHAT A BOOK!!!It‚Äôs been two weeks since I finished this book (or did the book finish me?!) and I still haven‚Äôt managed to get over the experience of ‚ÄúBeartown‚Äù. Truth be told, I think I never will. This is a book that stays with you. It buries itself into your soul, little by little, page by page, word by word. It claws its way into your heart, consumes you, ignites you, sets you aflame just to be able to extinguish the fire once it burns. With kindness, with love, with compassion. Every single sentence hurt, every page cut deep, and every paragraph let me lose hope in humanity and rebuilt it once again. I find myself incapable to convey how much this book touched me. I can‚Äôt express how badly it hurt, how beautiful it was or how much it made me wish to jump right into the book and to hug some of the characters. There was no chapter that didn‚Äôt pack a punch. Fredrick Backman‚Äôs writing style... it‚Äôs not from this world. There is so much wisdom between the pages, so many gestures and actions that seem to be miniscule at the moment you read them, but in the end they add up and are so much more once you get to that final punchline right between the lines. And once realization dawns on you, once you connect the dots and get aware of the bigger picture, you find yourself gasping for air.‚ÄùThis sport demands only one thing from you. Your all.‚ÄùSo what happened after two weeks? I went to the library and saw ‚ÄúBeartown‚Äù in the shelves. I had tears in my eyes just looking at the book so my bestie asked me what it is about and I tried to explain it to her. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a book about hockey in a small-town but it‚Äôs also about so much more than that‚Äù, I said, grasping for the right words to explain the inexplicable. How do you sum up a book like ‚ÄúBeartown‚Äù? How do you express the meaning between the lines? The subtle hints, the humanity written on those pages? The good as well as the bad parts of a two-sided coin that‚Äôs called humankind?‚ÄùIt doesn‚Äôt take a lot to be able to let go of your child. It takes everything.‚ÄùI know I‚Äôm being so vague here, BUT BOY, this is a book you better experience for yourself! This is the kind of book you read without knowing where it will lead, the kind of book that‚Äôs best read when you go into it blind and have no clue about what you‚Äôre getting yourself into. I can guarantee you one thing though, once you start to read it you won‚Äôt be able to stop and once you reached the ending you won‚Äôt be the same anymore. ‚ÄúBeartown‚Äù is one of those books that should be a classic and that, no doubt, will be one day! Some of the characters in here are amazing and each and every one of them is human and has its flaws. They are neither good nor bad, they just are. I loved so many of them and I hated or disliked a lot of them as well. Backman wrote a study of humanity and ‚ÄúBeartown‚Äù isn‚Äôt just a book about hockey it‚Äôs about people and their lives as well. And since I‚Äôm already talking about the characters I might as well give you a short introduction:
There might be mild spoilers ahead so if you don‚Äôt want to be spoiled you better stop here and don‚Äôt continue to read my review. Also the spoilers that are marked are the real deal so you better be careful with clicking those. ;-P
Benjamin (Benji):‚ÄùHer little Benjamin, the fighter with whom it‚Äôs far too easy for the girls of Beartown to fall in love. The boy with the most handsome face, the saddest eyes and the wildest heart they‚Äôve ever seen.‚ÄùI loved Benji so much!!! He‚Äôs the best and I would die for this boy!! <333 I hated to see him suffer, yet he never gave up. He did what he had to do, he‚Äôs the most loyal guy you‚Äôll ever find, but even though he loves his friends fiercely and would do everything for them he also knows what‚Äôs wrong and what‚Äôs right and it might have killed him... Hell, it DID kill him, but he still decided to do what was right and I‚Äôll forever love him for it! I‚Äôd read ‚ÄúUs Against You‚Äù just to see him once again! Benji deserves the world!!! ‚ÄùHere he is burdened with too much that no one sees, and here he has hockey. The team, the guys, Kevin. They mean everything to him, so he is everything they want him to be. And that‚Äôs a terrible thing. Having to keep a secret from those you love.‚Äù Ana:‚ÄùAna was a tornado. A jagged, hundred-sided peg in a community where everyone was supposed to fit into round holes.‚ÄùAna was such an amazing friend as well! I loved her friendship with Maya, how they could rely on each other, how she was basically a part of Maya‚Äôs family. Those two girls were so different but they were also the same and their relationship was so beautiful to witness. Maya Andersson:‚ÄùI know you‚Äôd have killed for me, Mum. I know you‚Äôd have given your life for me. But we‚Äôre going to get through this, you and me. Because I‚Äôm your daughter I‚Äôve got wolf‚Äôs blood.‚ÄùI‚Äôm in awe of Maya! This girl was so strong and Kira has every reason to be proud of her daughter. I don‚Äôt know what I would have done... but Maya, she did the best she could do. She even looked out for her brother and her friends and she never backed down. I‚Äôve never seen a braver girl and I swear Maya‚Äôs relationship with her parents was one of the best things in this book! <3 She had every freaking reason to go through with it, she could have pulled the trigger but she didn‚Äôt. She decided against it and that‚Äôs strength!! She gave him a taste of her fear and I think that taught him a lesson he will never forget. To die would have been easy, to live with the consequences of what he did, that‚Äôs the really hard thing and I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll never forget it.Kira & Peter Andersson:‚ÄùNot a second has passed since she had children without her feeling like a bad mother. For everything. For not understanding, for being impatient, for not knowing everything, for not making better packed lunches, for still wanting more out of life than just being a mother.‚ÄùKira and Peter were my favourite couple of this book! They‚Äôve been married for years, went through thick and thin together and yet they still love each other so much that it killed me! T_T Their scenes were so amazing and you could literally feel their strong bond. Also the way they interacted with their children, how they would have defended them with teeth and claws (Kira) and how they would hug away their pain (Peter) was EVERYTHING! I swear I strive to be a parent like that! <3 Kira and Peter are role models and I can only hope that my own kid will love and trust me as much as Maya loved and trusted her parents. Hell, I‚Äôd die for both of them too! <333‚ÄùThat may have been how they survived, Kira realizes: thanks to the ability not to fall apart at the same time.‚Äù‚ÄùLove me.‚Äù‚ÄúAlways.‚Äù‚ÄúLove me like you love hockey and David Bowie?‚Äù‚ÄúSo much more, Pumpkin, much, much more.‚Äù‚ÄùI didn‚Äôt want the bastards to see me bleed,‚Äù she whispers to her mother.‚ÄúSometimes I‚Äôm afraid that they‚Äôre going to have to. To understand that you‚Äôre a real person,‚Äù her mother sobs, clutching her daughter so very, very tightly in her arms.‚ÄùDo you think I‚Äôm less of a man because I can‚Äôt fight?‚Äù he whispers.‚ÄúDo you think I‚Äôm less of a woman because I can?‚Äù she asks. The Erdahl family:‚ÄùWhat did you get wrong? Perfection isn‚Äôt a goal in the Erdahl family, it‚Äôs the norm.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt like Kevin‚Äôs father but I liked his mother. She did the right thing even though it must have been so tough for her. Her heart-to-heart with Benji killed me and I was at least as devastated after their conversation as they were. This hurt so much. >_< Gods, this must be one of the worst things ever. To know that your own son raped a girl and to deal with that knowledge. You still love your child and want the best for it, yet you KNOW that it did something horrible and totally wrong. How do you deal with something like that? I hope I‚Äôll never find out. Also her knowing that Kevin could never lie to his best friend and that this is the reason why Benji kept away from her son. Everything about their heart-to-heart broke me! This was such a powerful scene! I think I‚Äôll never get over it. T_T ‚ÄùBenji tries to light a cigarette. His hands are shaking too much to hold the lighter. His tears extinguish the flame.‚Äù Amat & Fatima:‚ÄùHe‚Äôll allow her aching fingers to rest and give her aching back a break. He doesn‚Äôt want possessions. He just wants to lie in bed one single night without having to count.‚ÄùThose two had such a wonderful relationship! Amat loved his mother so much and she raised him well! I loved how Amat made the right choices even though he knew it would cost him everything. He didn‚Äôt run away, he faced the consequences and he fought for the truth. I‚Äôm sure Fatima is very proud of him because heaven knows, I AM! ‚ÄùYou know that my eyes work better than anyone else‚Äôs in here. Because that‚Äôs the first thing you learn on the Beartown Ice Hockey Club, isn‚Äôt it? You can‚Äôt teach that way of seeing. That‚Äôs something you‚Äôre born with.‚Äù‚ÄùI only need one man: my son. And you‚Äôre not alone. You‚Äôve never been alone. You just need to be better at choosing the company you keep.‚ÄùDavid:I was so conflicted about his character! At the beginning of the book I didn‚Äôt like him, then he started to grow on me, then there was a time I didn‚Äôt like him once again and at the ending I still kind of loved him?! AHHH! I didn‚Äôt agree with a lot of the things he said and did, but I also loved him for some of the things he didn‚Äôt say and didn‚Äôt do. Does that make sense? >_<‚ÄùThat‚Äôs betrayal. David knows it‚Äôs a huge betrayal. There‚Äôs no other way to explain how much a grown man must have failed as a person if such a warrior of a boy could believe that his coach would be less proud of him if he were gay. David hates himself for not being better than his dad. That‚Äôs the job of sons.‚ÄùAt first I thought he was disgusted by Benji being gay but then I realized that he was disgusted with himself for making jokes about being gay when he was with the team. That he hated himself for not realizing that Benji was gay and for making him hurt with his words and actions. He loathed himself for not giving Benji a safe enough environment to tell them the truth. I don‚Äôt agree with his stance on Peter and the way Kevin was taken away from the bus though and I totally agree with Sune here. One day when his own kid is at Maya‚Äôs age, David will feel differently and will realize that there are more important things than hockey. Your own kid always comes first and hockey is nothing compared to the well-being of your child.Ramona:‚ÄùThis town doesn‚Äôt always know the difference between right and wrong. I‚Äôll admit that. But we know the difference between good and evil.‚Äù I ADORE THIS WOMAN!!! <33 She might be grumpy and rough but she has her heart at the right place and that‚Äôs everything that counts. In a world dominated by men she stood her ground and forced them to see the truth. I just loved how all those grown men listened to her and acknowledged her opinion. This woman is one hell of a bear and more man than any of them! XDConclusion:I‚Äôll never be able to put all of my emotions into words so I‚Äôll just go with my initial thoughts after finishing the book and hope that they‚Äôll give you a good impression of how I feel about ‚ÄúBeartown‚Äù:I‚Äôm an emotional wreck. I‚Äôm Backman trash.Throw me in a dustbin and close the lid. The end.___________________________________I don‚Äôt know anything about hockey but I know a great deal about life in a small town. From what I could glean from the blurb this sounds like an intriguing story and after all those stellar ratings I‚Äôm pretty sure that I‚Äôll like it. I think I never read anything from Fredrik Backman before but I‚Äôm more than just ready to find out if he might be one of my new favourite authors. This said let‚Äôs tackle the remaining books on ""My Book List 2019""! 24 down, 16 more to go! XD (15 without this one!)"
14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365405-james,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 out of 5 stars to Beartown, a 2016 contemporary novel by Fredrik Backman. Although the book had a bit of a difficult start for me, it developed into an emotionally-charged hot bed, triggering anger and frustration over so many things about the human race... and I'm quite glad I read it and enjoyed it. But wow... I haven't a visceral emotional reaction to words like this in a very long time.

Why This Book

Beartown began showing up on a few of my Goodreads' friends booklists earlier this year, intriguing my interest. I read the overview and saw many comments that ""although the premise of all about a junior hockey team, it's so much more."" I had a hard time believing that to be true but thought it might be worth a chance if I could get it from NetGalley. And then I was approved to read it in early April. It took me a few weeks to find the right time in my reading schedule, but it all fell into place last week when I finally took the book on. Also of note: it‚Äôs translated from Swedish. 

Overview of Story

Beartown is a very small town in the middle of a forest far away from everywhere else. It was once bigger and stronger, but the economy has pushed it further and further down a hole -- to the point where all they have left is the possibility of a good junior hockey team in the future. Everyone in the town gets involved to some degree, either playing, supporting or raising the players who range from 13 to 17 years old. It's the place where agents sometimes go to find the next great star of the professional leagues.But the lack of resources and funding has led to a bitter passion among the residents, who seem to stop at almost nothing to ensure their kids have an opportunity to win their games. Some of the residents are fair and honest. Some are rude and malicious. It feels like a typical American sports town, (but the story is set in Sweden) breeding team camaraderie fueled in some cases by hatred and anger, but in a few, promoting acceptance and tolerance.Each of the key team members (8 to 10) has a personal story. Each of the parents and coaches have a vision. Rivalries and favoritism shine all around. And with each passing game, the school decided what side of the coin they're on... supporting the team and accepting hockey will always comes first, before education, or fighting back to keep a fair balance. But when someone is attacked, sides must be taken within the school, the team, the hockey league and the town.It's a story about hope, control, loss, jealousy, anger, and desire. It's about parenting styles. It's about looking the other way for the sake of long-term goals despite what you may be letting someone get away with in the short term. It's about how people treat one another. And in so many cases, it is not the way it should be.

Approach & Style

Beartown is told by an omniscient narrator who can look into any characters head at any moment.It's told in the present tense with a few small reflections on the past.Point of view changes and hops around within chapters, defined by a few spaces between paragraphs.It's mostly short sentence structure and paragraphs. Told the way people speak.

Strengths

1. I am not a big sports fan. I played on a soccer and baseball team when I was younger. And I worked for a sports arena for nearly 20 years. But I have never been interested in hockey. And while the story is too focused in the beginning on the pertinent parts of the sport and rules, it generally has a very good approach to building a fever for the team among us readers. When an author can do that, it's a strong book.2. The characters are fairly vivid, each representing a difference slice of life and personality. You will like a few. You will hate many of them. It's another good thing when an author can deliver this level of emotion. As an example, Maggan Lyt supports her son no matter what he has done. And she's rude to everyone, lies, believes her own lies and has no sense of morality. She wasn't a huge part of the story, but she is the epitome of what I hate about what sports can do to a kid. She's the worst kind of mother and should have been taught a bigger lesson. (I rarely go off on topics, especially like this... but she is what is wrong with so many things right now about how people behave in this world...)3. The setting is described nearly perfectly. You feel the despair. You see the emptiness. You can tell it's a freezing cold pit of fear.4. Views are told from everyone's angle. And even though you will have pure hatred for some of the people, part of you has a small understanding of why they do what they do. You won't accept it or like it, but you can see how it happened in Beartown. And you will wonder if that's what's happening in so many other towns across the country.

Open Questions & Concerns

During the first 60 to 75 pages, I was a little frustrated at the focus on hockey as a sport the town rallied around. It was slightly boring and difficult to connect. I trudged through, reading 75 pages the first night and the second night. By the third night (last night). I was 35% through and starting to feel that intense sensation where you just don't want to put the book down, and I finished the last 300 pages all in one sitting (in bed). Intense because I was so angry at the people, the actions and their beliefs. It made me feel sorrow for any town who focuses on sports as the center of their life. I've always thought high school sporting teams were full of nonsense. I don't want to alienate any readers of the book or even my reviews... but I really have to ask the question... Do school sports breed teamwork or do they breed arrogance and nasty habits of accepting things just because you're on the same team? I'm sure there are good examples of a team building positive traits in children... but this was not one of them. When they're proud to have injuries... when they support someone who has clearly done something bad because they are on the same team... when they use derogatory language in a locker room because it helps create a bond... that's not teamwork. That's humanity at its worst... that's people thinking they are above others because they have some physical talent for playing a sport. I have little if any tolerance or patience for people like that. Even when I played on teams, sure, I bought into the ""rah, rah, let's win"" concept. But the second it crosses that line and because a situation where it's just bad behavior or the thoughts of the uninformed and lazy, ridiculous politics of small minds, I wish they'd all go straight to hell in a hand-basket. And that's how this book made me feel - it conjured up those feelings.... and it was really well done. It hit all the hot spots I have about awful sports parents, horrible team members who think they can do anything because they're a ""hero.""I couldn't push this up to a perfect 5 for a few reasons, but it's very close!1. Some of the characters felt too similar / duplicate. I had a bit of a hard time distinguishing them from one another, e.g. which parent is that, what happened to that kid before the game? It could have been a little tighter in this area.2. I'm a bit unclear on the ending... it was like there were 2 possible versions... and I wanted to know exactly what happened. It also didn't feel like every character had a proper ending... a few open issues left for me.

Author & Other Similar Books

I haven't read any other sports-themed books, so I don't have anything to compare it to from that perspective. But as far as the intensity of your anger or hatred for some of the characters... I would liken it to how I felt about James K. Morrow's The Philosopher's Apprentice.

Final Thoughts

I've ranted a bit here. It's a powerful book. It showcases many of the fears I have about a good portion of the country. I'm all for team spirit and finding hope in an activity when there seems to be nothing else available; however, if this is a commentary on what it's like for many towns across the world... my fears are justified. And when a book can share and show that... it's a really strong one... and worth the read.P.S. No offense intended to anyone who is a big sports fan, sports parents or sports player themselves. The anger I felt in reading this book is for the negativity steaming off all the wrong things about sports and how they make people act. I'm all for a positive, character-building team sport where the intensity is on the field... and the only thing left off the field is friendship, fair and honest support and an ability to know when to draw the line.

16,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,Rating 3 out of 5,"Beartown is a small town in the forest with a dwindling population and ever decreasing resources. Beartown is also a hockey town where the sport's importance only increases when it begins to become tied into the financial future of the town. When the junior team is actually poised to win the finals this year the whole town starts to become hopeful about the future. Things become tense in this environment when a violent act is perpetrated by one of the boys on the team the night of the semi-finals, leaving the whole town feeling that their future is in jeopardy. Spoilers ahead. This one was 3.5 stars for me.I think everyone else enjoyed it much more than I did. I did enjoy it, but I just felt that the story line could have been much tighter. Like there was a lot put into the book that felt unnecessary to the story line and it detracted from it. I might have also enjoyed it less than others because I couldn't help but compare it to A Man Called Ove which completely wrecked me. The story there also unfolds in a much neater manner and everything in the book only seems to add to the story which doesn't necessarily apply to this book. I especially feel that way about the ending, like that seen with Maya or the four year old girl that eventually grows up to become a star apparently. Neither of those things felt like they had to be put in their. Also adding Zacharias' suicidal ideation was clearly there just to distract us from figuring out who shoots the shots from the beginning of the book but it felt manipulative like it was put in their just to up the tension or suspense. Also the whole things with the shots didn't feel like it had to be a thread running through the book, the books feels like it's supposed to work up to revealing what happens there but it makes such a mess of doing so that it felt pointless to start the book off with that scene. It would've been just as powerful a scene there at the end without opening with it. If anything opening with it just made it distracting through out the book because I just kept wondering about it and it took me away from really getting into the book.That said I did however enjoy this book a lot and I loved the depth of the characters and the way it went into the themes of a rural town struggling to sustain itself and the way people are treated when they report rape. It was all very timely in this political climate and I think it was handled with nuance and painted a complex picture of all the characters. I really enjoy it when books humanize characters whose actions we may find abhorrent because I think its one of those things we tend to lose sight of in day to day life. I would totally read more of Backman's work in the future, just hope next time the editor tells him to cut out the frivolous details."

Late one evening, toward the end of March, a teenager picked up a double-barreled shotgun, walked into the forest, put the gun to someone else's forehead, and pulled the trigger. This is the story of how we got there.
At first I wasn't really getting into this book. I don't know why because:1) I love the author2) I love hockey3) I love coming of age stories4) I love the cold 5) I love small towns. I was born in one.It finally got to where I liked it enough to change stars from 3 to 4. Although, I really wish for a better ending. Don't get me wrong, it was a great ending. . . I just wanted....... something else to happen. Uggg, I can't say because you will know. Let me just say I wouldn't haven't walked away and maybe those that have read it will know what I'm talking about. This whole little community of Beartown is nothing but hockey baby. And a lot of these boys are pretty bad @ssed on the ice! I mean they are going somewhere, maybe not where they want to go. There are a lot of characters in the story. Some I hated more than life (one in particular) and others I liked. I can't keep them all straight and I didn't write them all down. Damn.BenjiKevinAmatMayaetc and so on. these kids are all different ages and of course everyone in the town knows each other. A lot of them have been there since the ice age. And there is nothing wrong with that. It's not just about hockey, although most of it is, but it's about them growing up with hockey, how they feel. There are adults that having issues. There is a terrible attack in the town that throws everyone out of kilter. To me that was simple, red hot poker people, red hot poker. To me, I think this would have been a nice place to live if it wasn't one of those places where the sport is more important than a human life so to speak. I can't say more. Otherwise, the close knit community is a great thing. I wish I could have loved it to death like everyone else on the face of the planet but I thought it was good enough. Welcome to Beartown!

They are not always as good as they seem. But I decided to give a try to Beartown and oh, blew me away.I am not someone outside sports and I understand the sacrifices that have to be made to achieve goals. When I was a teenager I practiced swimming. We had a national preselection competition. I got the flu and I kept swimming even with fever, because that was demanded from me. I ended up with bronchopneumonia and I had to stop swimming for life. Actions and consequences.This book catches you from the start. You don't know how it will end up in the first page prediction. It could literally be anyone. The story is full of teenagers.Beartown is a city with subzero temperatures most of the year, in decay, businesses closing and many layoffs. Its people speak little and are well delimited according to their social position. The higher you live, the better your income.The people have their hopes set on the junior hockey team. If they win, they expected investments will be made in the town and it will be a better place.But even if Beartown only talks about hockey, the book is much more. Do not expect lessons, or complicated language. It's more about people and players. It is about the President of the hockey club that must accept demands from the sponsors to continue sponsoring, about the General Manager who must fire his mentor so that they can appoint another person, on the hockey star and excellent student, but his parents are always absent, about his best friend without whom he can't play but who keeps a great secret, about the owner of the bar that has not left the premises since her husband died eleven years ago, about how a Family survives when one of the children dies, about how the town faces a horrible crime that will affect hockey, and much, much more.There are many characters and each one of them is important. No one is named to name it. You know who they are and how they think. This is one of the best features of the book. It's close. In more than one opportunity it will leave you feeling more of an emotion.Undoubtedly it is one of the best books I've ever read.‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®No siempre, aunque m√°s en el √∫ltimo a√±o, compro los libros que tienen mucha publicidad. No siempre son tan buenos como parecen. Pero a Beartown decid√≠ darle una oportunidad y oh, como me impact√≥. No soy alguien ajena a los deportes y entiendo los sacrificios que hay que hacer para lograr metas. Cuando era adolescente practicaba nataci√≥n. Ten√≠amos una competencia de preselecci√≥n nacional. Me dio gripe y segu√≠ nadando inclusive con fiebre porque eso se me exig√≠a. Al final me dio bronconeumon√≠a y tuve que dejar la nataci√≥n de por vida. Acciones y consecuencias.Este libro te atrapa desde el inicio. No sabes c√≥mo terminar√° en la predicci√≥n de la primera p√°gina. Literalmente podr√≠a ser cualquiera. La historia est√° llena de adolescentes. Beartown es una ciudad con temperaturas bajo cero la mayor parte del a√±o, en decadencia, negocios cerrando y muchos despidos. Su gente habla poco y est√°n bien delimitados seg√∫n su posici√≥n social. Mientras m√°s arriba vivas significar√° mejores ingresos. El pueblo tiene sus esperanzas puestas en el equipo Junior de hockey. Si ellos ganan se espera que se hagan inversiones en el pueblo y pueda prosperar. Pero aunque en Beartown solo se habla de hockey, el libro es mucho m√°s. No esperen lecciones, ni lenguaje complicado. Es m√°s sobre las personas y los jugadores. Es sobre el Presidente del club de hockey que debe aceptar exigencias de los patrocinadores para que sigan patrocinando, sobre el General Manager que debe despedir a su mentor para que puedan nombrar en su puesto a otra persona, sobre la estrella del hockey y excelente estudiante, pero que sus padres siempre est√°n ausentes, sobre su mejor amigo sin el que no puede jugar pero que guarda un gran secreto, sobre la due√±a del bar que no ha salido del local desde que se muri√≥ su esposo hace once a√±os, sobre c√≥mo sobrevive una familia cuando se muere uno de los hijos, sobre c√≥mo enfrenta el pueblo un hecho descabellado que afectar√° al hockey, y mucho, mucho m√°s. Hay muchos personajes y cada uno de ellos es importante. No se nombra a alguien por nombrarlo. Conoces qui√©n es cada quien y c√≥mo piensa. Esta es una de las mejores caracter√≠sticas del libro. Es cercano. En m√°s de una oportunidad te dejar√° sintiendo m√°s de una emoci√≥n. Sin lugar a dudas es uno de los mejores libros que he le√≠do."
19,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49815208-marilynw,Rating 4 out of 5,"Beartown (Beartown #1)by Fredrik Backman, Marin Ireland (Narrator)Beartown is nothing, if not a hockey town. But the town has been dying for a long time and the only chance of saving Beartown is if the junior hockey team can pull off a win at the national semi-finals and then pull off a win at the finals. Doing so will draw in the big sponsors, bring a brand new rink to the town, and change the entire future of a town that is going nowhere but down. So when a teen girl is attacked by someone important to the hockey team, when she reports the attack, it's the girl who is vilified for even saying a word about what happened. No one interferes with the hockey team and if they do, they and their family will pay. Times like these are when we see who really is a good person or not. Some things are unforgivable in this town and they are not the things one would expect. Things are different in a hockey town that has worshipped hockey for so long and won't let it go until it's dying day. Bad things are foreshadowed from the beginning of the story so there is a sense of doom throughout. This story is less about hockey than about having the courage to say, do, and back what is right, no matter how doing so will blow your life to smithereens. I fell in love with a few of the characters and admire their courage to stand up to those who have the power to flatten them.Pub April 25 2017 by Simon Schuster Audio"

‚ÄúAll your best qualities come from the fact that you‚Äôve been raised in a house full of women.‚Äù
After the constant battering my heart and soul received, and the injustice of the story over took my mind, and the bleakness of it all was slowly brought forth, woven in with moments of absolute heartwarming tenderness and laughter, it was that above quote that finally broke me and I couldn‚Äôt stop crying. I don‚Äôt know whether to expand on the synopsis or let readers discover its impact on their own. There isn‚Äôt much - and there is much - that you need to know about this story. It‚Äôs set in a small town that has hinged its identity to hockey. It‚Äôs a small town that gets uprooted after an injustice occurs. And Backman dissects it like a pro.It‚Äôs 2:40am. I‚Äôll expand on the review in a few hours. Hopefully. (I've decided I don't have it in me to review this. Mainly because this review would turn into an essay, but it would also mean revisiting and sorting through the emotional baggage this book unfolded within me. Just know that it is one of my favourite books of all time.)‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîI think I've put myself in the mind-set of being emotionally distraught.

21,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m,Rating 5 out of 5,"Hockey. What did I care about hockey? I didn't. But the novel soon becomes about more than just the sport, about so much more than I can articulate in a review without giving too much away, but I'll try. Backman tells us early on what I was about to discover for myself.""Why does anyone care about hockey?  ...Because it tells stories. ""Beartown is a small Swedish town in a forest that could be a small town anywhere. Maybe the sport in these towns is baseball or soccer or football. But here it is hockey. In spite of the universality of it, there is a sense of place so striking that it's like another character. This is the story of many of the town's residents - the kids, their families and how they are connected by the game, but the connections are more than just the game . There are alternating chapters, sometimes just alternating paragraphs about them, with new characters continually introduced. Somehow the continuity is never lost; someone is always linked to someone else. The narrative moves from character to character, family to family providing such an in depth picture of who they are. It takes an amazingly talented writer to do this with so many characters to keep tract of. The writing sometimes feels subtle but yet I came to intimately know these characters as I did in his other novels.Young hockey players, coaches who are former hockey players, their spouses, mothers and fathers. It seems that just about everyone carries a burden. Some are grieving, some are lonely, some are bullied, some carry secrets, yet a few summon the strength to move forward. My favorite characters are Maya, who in the face of being victimized provides the strength and love that holds her family together and of course Ramona who lifts herself out of her grief to save the town from itself. I can't forget about Amat who wants to fit in, save his mother but faces the challenge of doing what is right and Ana the best friend that anyone could ever hope for. Backman has woven a complex story full of sadness, hope, discovery, people fighting their own demons, about parents and kids. Not all the games are won but there are triumphs of friendship, love, and doing what is right. To Fredrik Backman , I say from the heart tack sa mycket for another beautiful story. I received an advanced copy of this from Atria through NetGalley and Edelweiss."

I'm not a sports person let alone a hockey person. Thanks to my Goodreads friends I took a chance on it. I'm so glad I did! 5 Stars for Beartown! This book grabbed me from the very beginning and never let go. Bang bang bang is still in my head! Beartown is about a declining small town in Sweden that revolves around it's hockey team. There are so many characters in this book, including current hockey players and former players. The fate of this town revolves around hockey. I would love to see this made into a movie. I could see Meryl Streep playing Ramona. I loved her! I'd like to see Tom Hiddleston as David. I could keep casting but you will just get a list of my favorite actors! Lol!Props to the narrator, Marin Ireland! She was awesome! I wouldn't recommend this as a first listen only because there are so many different characters in the story but otherwise I highly recommend the audio! This is my first Fredrik Backman book but it will definitely not be my last! Read or listen to it. It will be on many people's top 10 list of 2017 for sure!"

Wow...I loved the first book I read of this author, A man called Ove. Second book I read, My grandmother told me.... was good, but not as good as I wanted it to be. But this one, Beartown, is out of every league. And it underlines the quality of the author, this story being so different in storyline and style of writing, from his other books. What strikes me is the incredibly human touch of this book on every page. Big tragedy, personal struggles, pain, courage and love combined. Heartfelt. Emotional. Sincere. What can I say, yes, I cried again, yes, it's a five star... Although not the main character in the book, I loved Ramona, the bartender of the Bearskin bar in town... And Benji... And Ana...And Amat...And Maya... Still have to breath... and think about this book;-) Highly recommended for those who have not read this one yet!The story in short: People say Beartown is finished. A tiny community nestled deep in the forest, it is slowly losing ground to the ever-encroaching trees. But down by the lake stands an old ice rink. And that ice rink is the reason people in Beartown believe tomorrow will be better than today. Their junior ice hockey team is about to compete in the national semifinals, and they actually have a shot at winning. All the dreams of this place now rest on the shoulders of a handful of teenage boys. Being responsible for the hopes of an entire town is a heavy burden and the semifinal match is the catalyst for a violent at that will leave the town in turmoil. Accusations are made, and, like ripples on a pond, they travel through all of Beartown, leaving no resident unaffected...."

BEARTOWN is way out yonder in the middle of a forest where winter temperatures reach sub-zero and hockey is the name of the game for its struggling residents.You don't have to be a hockey fan, or sports fan for that matter, to read BEARTOWN, you only have to (once again) sit back and enjoy the superb and addictive story telling of Fredrik Backman.So get ready.....there's a whole gang of characters who each have their own personal stories to tell.....some even have big secrets, and some do evil, but most importantly, many of them will demonstrate what it means to have a big heart, show courage in the face of danger, and even give up their dreams if it means survival for their small town.I was surprised how my opinion of certain characters changed as the story developed, and although I have more than one favorite, Ramona is the one that will stick with me for a good while.....what a tough cookie!Excellent Read!

27,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Scandal is the British title for Beartown, a remote northern town in Sweden, a place in a cycle of economic decline and a community with an unabashed primal tribal obsession with its junior ice hockey team. This is a dark and cold town where everyone knows everyone. A hockey team from whom much is expected and demanded, instrumental in defining the identity of a wide array of characters that inhabit this superlative novel, each providing their pivotal piece to the story. Backmann has truly outdone himself in how he exposes and asks the deepest questions of his characters and the community. It begins with a teenager committing a shocking act that sets the scene for how this comes to be, and the consequent reverberations that splinter Beartown apart as people come to sit on one side of the fence or the other. It is about the complications and difficulties of doing the right thing in the face of those willing to overlook justice and condone the unacceptable for the apparent 'greater good' of the team and the town. We come to understand the sacrifices, stresses and strains of being on the hockey team, the rivalries, the different values of the coaches, the aggressions, the friendships, the parties and the star team player for whom the only thing that matters is to win. There are the demanding expectations of the team by the rest of the community and their hopes that it will revive the town from its path to potential oblivion. Involvement in the team offers an escape from the complexities and difficulties of real life for the team and its supporters. There are insights into the families of the players, the business sector and others. We see the problem of unwavering adulation and the inability of players to emotionally handle this and contributing to morally problematic behaviour. We see Maya's pain, resilience and courage, her reasons for sleeping at her friend, Ana's home regularly. The wisdom of Amal's mother in emphasising honesty, kindness and for the need to do good. There are so many notable characters from Benji and the amazing Ramona as we see if Beartown is capable of delivering justice with bated breath.One of the major reasons Backmann's novel is so powerful and successful is that he taps into the universality of passion for sport. The characters with their maelstrom of reactions and feelings reflect their prevalence in any team in any sport and their supporters, connecting every reader to the story. Into this background Backmann throws a metaphorical grenade that rocks an entire community, and this grenade is based on the true realities in a world where some sports team members have engaged in precisely the same kind of despicable behaviours outlined, resulting in communities facing similar issues. This is a multilayered narrative that resonates on virtually every level. Backmann's characters and their development is simply masterful. The author managed to wring a wide range of heartfelt emotions from me, including anger and outrage. This is a story that takes on dark, complex, harrowing issues and deals with them with depth, candour and wisdom. A must read book that I cannot recommend highly enough. Many thanks to Penguin Michael Joseph for an ARC."

29,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30978160-meredith-trying-to-catch-up,Rating 5 out of 5,"On the surface, Beartown is a book about hockey, but it‚Äôs so much more! Beartown is about friendship, loyalty, family, and, loss. It‚Äôs about a town that‚Äôs fighting to stay alive. It‚Äôs about a girl who is wronged, and the boy who commits the wrong. It‚Äôs about a town that becomes divided over what‚Äôs right and wrong, good vs. evil, and the blurred lines in between. It‚Äôs about those little things that people do, but aren‚Äôt always seen. It's about the bravest people who break away from the pack to do what‚Äôs right, even though the consequences might destroy the town that they love. To sum it up, 
this is a book about love.
I honestly cannot find the words to convey what an amazing book this is. Beartown is more than a book--it‚Äôs an experience. "

‚ÄúWhat an uncomfortable, terrible source of shame it is for the world that the victim is so often the one left with the most empathy for others.‚Äù
In a large Swedish forest, Beartown hides a dark secret... Cut off from everywhere else it experiences the kind of isolation that tears people apart, and each year more and more of the town is swallowed by the forest. Then the town is offered a bright new future. But it‚Äôs all put in jeopardy by a single, brutal act. It divides the town into those who think it should be hushed up and forgotten, and those who'll risk the future to see justice done. Who will speak up? Could you stand by and stay silent? Or would you risk everything for justice? Which side would you be on?Set in the fictional Beartown, this is the story of a town obsessed with its Hockey team. It's the story of what happens when loyalties and passions are tested and when what is right smashes right up against what is longed for. It‚Äôs also the story of the lengths a town will go to to save itself. The opening page sets this novel up as a crime thriller, but it‚Äôs so much more than that. This is, at its heart, a story about community. More than that, it's a story about misogyny, patriarchy and rape culture, and about the myth that exposing and eradicating these is more of a threat to a community than allowing them to fester unchallenged. The authors writing does what the very best books do, it makes you feel, think and reflect, from many perspectives. This book makes you angry, makes you cry, makes you love, and hate. There is an entire world in its pages, and I can see why this book is so popular. I didn‚Äôt fully appreciate this book until I had finished it and then couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it. I highly recommend."

Nor because I like hockey, actually most sports, come from a sports mad family, because I do. No, my rating reflects the fact that this book engaged all my thoughts, all my emotions, in essence I identified with it in a big way. I come from a small town, like Beartown, which suffers from comparisons to the wealthier, little snobbery town to the North. Our sport is football, a sport four of my five sons played from youth on, over twenty years, and that town is our main rival. If no other team is beaten that season but that one, it is considered a victory.This story embraces way more than the sport though, it also showcases the boys, the coaches, the fans, backers, other students in town and of course the parents. The commitment, the teamwork, the fighting spirit, the bringing together and the tearing apart. The families and what it means to be part of one, responsibilities of teachers and coaches. Friends, the author mentions that the intensity of the friendships formed when you are a teenager are unlike any others and I find this to be so true. Something terrible happens in this little town, in fact the story opens with an ominous act of foreshadowing. Now it becomes a questions of judgment, town judgment, team judgment, of integrity and being brave enough to do the right thing. The characters outstanding, will never forget Benji, Amat and Bobo, Maya and Ana, young teens with so much on their shoulders. Parenting, what kind of parent are you? Would you look the other way, how would you act? Support without question? Condemn without question? Communities, what does being part of one mean? How can you bring together that which is torn apart? So many questions raised. Applying not just to sports but inclusively to all. As I said a fantastic book, a meaningful one, for me an unforgettable one. Can't wait to buy this for my 16 year old granddaughter, have already told my two daughters to read and plan to gift this book to my sons. There is something inside it for everyone to find.ARC from Simon and Schuster.Published May 2nd."

Small towns, man. I grew up in a small town. You either know everybody or you are related to them. I could not get away fast enough. People in small towns have each others backs - until that moment when they don't. People like to choose a side. What if you chose the wrong side?Beartown is a hockey town. Seriously, who does not love a hockey town? Showing my bias - I love hockey. Beartown residents love the game, they love their players, they love to win. They take great pride in their hockey achievements. The small town hockey team is about to compete in the national semi-finals and guess what????? They might just win!!!! The town's pride rests on the shoulders of the teenage players. Most are hungry to win. Most have dreamed (and trained) of this moment for as long as they can remember. But is carrying the towns hopes and dreams on their shoulders too much for this group or will they rally to the challenge? Are the town and their parents putting too much pressure on them?""Never again do you find friends like the one's you have when you are fifteen years old.""Peter is the General Manager of the Beartown Hockey team and the Maya's father. A former player himself he wants his team to win and then a devestating act changes him and his family forever. Maya and Ana are close friends. Ana spends most nights at Maya's home as her home life is uncomfortable and strained. Both rely on each other for emotional support and friendship. Their friendship is strong and can weather any storm. And a storm is coming........After a night of celebrating a violent assault takes place. An assault that turns good hard working people into angry people out for blood - parents trying to save their hockey team. People take sides. They don't seem to really care about facts, or the truth, they believe what the want to believe. Once they have that belief, it is hard to change their mind. Who do you believe? The 15 year old girl with bruises? or the Confident Hockey player who the town has placed all of their hopes and dreams upon.""Words are not small things.""They are HUGE things. People use their words to hurt in this book i.e. bullying and blaming the victim. There is also a group mentality among the family members of the players. Other characters are also the victims of harsh words via bullying. Words are also important in the context of truth. There comes a time in this book where characters wrestle with telling the truth or staying silent. There is one man in particular in this book who tries to keep a couple of characters silent. Each person has to decide what words they will say. Will they tell the truth or stay silent?Before I go any further let me just make one thing clear - I LOVED this book. I will make a stand and say I believe it is Backman's best. It is powerful and poetic at the same time. His writing is beautiful and poignant. I'm mean seriously take this line: ""The room is silent enough to hear when his heart breaks."" I'm mean really...his words are beautiful and haunting. Backman eloquently gives the reader a glimpse into the inhabitants of a small town's lives. There are a lot of characters in this book and yet the amount of characters never seems overwhelming. There are characters who are driven to practice day in and day out because they do not lose (Kevin), characters (Benji) who lost a parent to suicide and raised by his sisters, a man (Peter)who is a father and General Manager of the Hockey team whose daughter is the victim, a player (Amat)who has been raised by a single Mother and is the fastest and youngest on the team, a character (Maya)who is a 15 year old who loves her guitar and plays day and night. There are so many characters in this book and yet each has an interesting back story. Each contributes to the story, each causes us to think and feel.There is sadness in this book and there is beauty. There is love, friendship, pain, lies, denial and a violent assault. There are so many themes in this book and I could write half the night - but I wont. Sometimes simplicity is best. So simply put, this book was AMAZING!!!!!For those who do not like sports or hockey *GASP* please note: This is a book about Hockey and yet is not about hockey. It is a book about human nature, relationships, the good and the bad in people, wanting to fit in, wanting to be better, wanting to belong, wanting to win, and wanting to be accepted.If you have not read this book and you love to read - READ THIS BOOK!! This book is about how one community comes together for Hockey but is torn apart by a violent act. How friendships and loyalty are questioned and pushed to their limits. How people choose sides. About good vs. evil. About how lives can be changed forever.Can I just say that I think Backman is just getting warmed up. I think he is going to continue to dazzle us with his brilliant novels for years to come. I HIGHLY Recommend this book.See more of my reviews at www.openbookposts.com"
33,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,Rating 5 out of 5,"I loved Backman's A Man Called Ove. I really really liked My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry. But when I read Backman's last full length novel -- Britt-Marie Was Here -- I wondered whether Backman was a one trick pony, the formula being to create a quirky difficult character and the people who come to love him/her because he/she has a good heart under that gruff exterior.Well it turns out that Backman is no One Trick Pony, and he has a lot to write about besides quirky difficult characters. Beartown is nothing like Backman 's earlier novels. Beartown is a small town in Sweden obsessed with its junior hockey team. The novel focuses on an ensemble of disparate characters associated with the hockey team in different ways. Something nasty happens, and it shows the worst side of small communities and sports. The challenge with reviewing Beartown is that it's hard not to talk about what makes this book so interesting and powerful without giving away any spoilers. Suffice it to say that Beartown asks some big questions about small communities, families and friendship -- questions about the price of belonging and not belonging, the ugliness and beauty of loyalty, the lengths that parents will go to to protect their children from the herd, and many more. These questions are not explored at the expense of the characters or story. Backman's strength remains his ability to create characters, especially those who are outliers. And the end was brilliant.

34,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106675807-aleksandra,Rating 5 out of 5,"5/5There are authors who can make you fall in love with their story, even if nothing that exciting happens, simply by their writing. Fredrik Backman falls into this category. This book was so simple, yet so beautiful. At some points I needed to look out the window and just think for a moment after what I read. That‚Äôs how hard this story hit me. I never thought that a book about a tiny community living in a small town nestled deep in the forest will leave me speechless at the end. A small town where, for most people, hockey is the most important thing. Sometimes, too important. A small town called Beartown, whose people, despite being aware of the hardships of life there, will not leave it, because it‚Äôs their town. Beartown, a place I don‚Äôt really know how to feel about, because I hated it and some of its people, but at the same time I loved it and felt extremely connected to it. 

‚ÄúNo one could have a better mom than you. No one.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe can move, darling. We can . . .‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù her mom cries. ‚ÄúBecause this is my fucking town too,‚Äù the girl replies.""""you‚Äôll have much better opportunities to develop there.‚Äù Benji gives a nonchalant shrug. His answer is as short as it is uncompromising: ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm from Beartown.‚Äù

The main reason I fell in love with this story is its characters. Ana, Maya, Benji, Kira, Peter, Amat, Fatima, Sune and Ramona. There were many more, but these particular ones stole my heart. I laughed and I cried with them, I wanted to get into the book and hug them, or scream at them. The fact that after reading just the first few chapters I already felt a connection with all of them only confirm my belief that Fredrik is a brilliant writer. Each of them was special in their own way, but I must admit that Kira was my favorite. She was so strong, she loved with all her heart, and her relationship with her children and husband was so precious. I could easily write entire essays about each of them, especially Benji, Sune, Fatima, Amat, and Peter, but my review would probably be too long to post here, so I'll just say that each of these characters taught me something new and I am very grateful for this. I can't wait to finish their story in the next books. The view on friendship, parenthood, marriage, being a woman, growing up, your sexuality and race were portrayed in a such realistic way. I actually loved how real this book felt, it‚Äôs one of the reasons why I enjoyed it to this extent. 

""Peter and Kira are sitting in the kitchen, holding each other‚Äôs hands. ‚ÄúDo you think I‚Äôm less of a man because I can‚Äôt fight?‚Äù he whispers. ‚ÄúDo you think I‚Äôm less of a woman because I can?‚Äù she asks.""

I'm also a big fan of the way the author created female characters here. My history with women written by a man in books is, let‚Äôs say, not so good. But, here? The women here were amazing. Living in a small community full of men, where male-dominated sport was the point of too many people's lives, where misogynistic words were spoken from the mouths of too many men, was difficult, but the heroines here were strong, supported each other and did not give up despite many terrible situations.I debated whether I should rate it four and a half or five, but Fredrick is a damn good writer and this book and its characters deserve those five stars. I can‚Äôt wait to dive into the next books. I know they will hurt, but I‚Äôm ready. At least, I hope I am."

Because I am a terrible liar. Sorry I read this one wrong, everyone. Your billions of 4 and 5 Star reviews shall serve as evidence of my failure.First, to all of you who were aware how hesitant I was to try this after my experience with A Man Called Ove and who promised this was really not a hockey book, I have this to say . . . . 

It is 173% a hockey book ‚Äì nearly exclusively for the first 38%, but really FOR.EV.ER. because ‚Äúit‚Äôs a hockey town,‚Äù yo! And heaven help if they stop reminding you about that fact for one flippin‚Äô page.Next, here are some notes I made:‚ÄúIf this another motherfucking book about a girl who goes to a party and gets raped by an overprivileged white boy who then either ends up killing/threatening to kill him or the boy who loves her/the bullied fat kid/her bestie/her daddy decides to kill/threaten to kill him on her behalf Imma burn the fucking building down.‚ÄùI didn‚Äôt burn the building down! Yay me . . . .

However, I am T.I.R.E.D. of these books. The subject matter at hand shouldn‚Äôt be a tired trope. Especially from an author who presents the viewpoint that ‚Äúno one tells you it can be with someone you know.‚Äù Fuck you, dude. EVERYONE knows that it‚Äôs most likely going to happen by someone you know and unless you live in a ‚ÄúBeartown‚Äù where no one teaches anything other than hockey, that‚Äôs what you learn growing up.Obviously I didn‚Äôt like this. I didn‚Äôt like the stuff mentioned above, or how un(or under)developed the OH-SO-MANY characters were, or that there always seemed to be HUNDREDS of pages left to read because the pacing was non-existent, or that it was so devoid of emotion. (I noticed that the same translator who was used in Ove was not used here. Maybe he can shoulder part of the blame?) I considered bumping up a half Star simply for Ramona . . . . 

And Bobo . . . . 

But JFC, at some point I have to stop rewarding clich√©s, ya know?I think I need to cut ties at this point, appreciate the one beautiful story I read by this author and not sullen my own memory of him further.Sorry I failed you all . . . yet again.

So we always end up arguing about where the boundaries should be drawn. How selfish are we allowed to be? How much are we obliged to care about each other?""First of all, let me get this out of the way right off the bat since I know I‚Äôm in the minority here. I rated Beartown 3.5 stars and am rounding down rather than up. The short explanation is that I have read Backman‚Äôs A Man Called Ove, My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She‚Äôs Sorry, and Britt-Marie Was Here. I gave all of those novels 4 stars. In hindsight, Ove was likely more of a 4.5. I simply didn‚Äôt like Beartown as much as those three (emphasis on 'as much' rather than 'didn't like'). I finished reading it more than two weeks ago, and have been letting it simmer ever since, and my initial reaction has not changed. Was it because this one detoured from Backman‚Äôs ‚Äòusual‚Äô fare featuring the grumpy old man or woman? No, not at all. In fact, I was glad to hear that we were going to get something diverging from that accustomed theme. I was thrilled in fact! I love Backman‚Äôs writing and have said so before. However, I felt‚Ä¶ well, icky, reading this book. I know it was meant to be uncomfortable ‚Äì there were some tough topics raised and I thank Backman for presenting them to us. It‚Äôs an important book. One thing Backman does exceedingly well is depicting a small town atmosphere. ""The town wakes early, like it does every day; small towns need a head start if they‚Äôre going to have any chance in the world."" He also does a fantastic job of bringing the stinging chill of these fictional Swedish towns right into your own living room - even if you happen to be reading in the broiling heat of summer as I did. Where he really shines is in the portrayal and development of the underdog or the more isolated characters. There are a small handful of them here and I wish I could have seen even more of them ‚Äì Sune, Benji, Amat, and Ana, in particular. The cast of characters is fairly extensive in Beartown, and I found that when I was just getting settled into some quality time with one, I was quickly jolted into time spent with another instead. The narrative shifts rather quickly, not just from chapter to chapter but within a single chapter. Just a little quibble there. I have teenagers. Teenagers in sports. We're not obsessed, we enjoy participating and watching as much as we enjoy our other forms of diversion. Thank goodness we have not encountered anything to the extent that those in Beartown have experienced. Actually, the first third or half of the book was what I liked least. The teen culture and angst just didn‚Äôt grab me. It actually made me cringe! Likely because I‚Äôm in the thick of it right now ‚Äì fortunately my two make my life easy, but I see it all around, I hear about it from my own. Mine don‚Äôt play hockey, but anyone reading this book knows that you can substitute any sport in here for hockey. For that matter, any event or activity that seems to consume a town, a school, or a family in such a way that it becomes ‚Ä¶ unhealthy at best‚Ä¶ can be filled in for ‚Äòhockey‚Äô here. ""Hockey is never satisfied being part of your life, it wants to be all of it."" As a family, we make an effort everyday to make sure that we put everything in perspective, not just one aspect of our lives. If you don‚Äôt, then I fear a crisis and a moral dilemma like that explored in this book. I have chats with my daughter nearly every day about something that she questions or that she finds uncomfortable. Things she sees and hears about. I‚Äôm lucky she comes to me. Okay, I‚Äôm digressing from the book again ‚Äì sorry! Anyway, the second half of the book really picked up for me. When things spiral of control, I was relieved to find that there are those that can overcome adversity and make the right choices ‚Äì adults and teens both. The alternative is pretty grim and disheartening otherwise. ""All organizations like to boast that they‚Äôre building a culture, but when it comes down to it everyone really only cares about one sort: the culture of winning."" Yikes. I did like this book - I just didn‚Äôt love it as I somewhat expected and hoped to do. But that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs more of an ‚Äúit‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs me‚Äù kind of thing. I still love Backman and his writing and as I‚Äôve said before, I‚Äôll read whatever else he writes. I‚Äôd love to read more with a specific focus on one or two of Beartown‚Äôs characters in a later book - minus the teen culture perhaps. I need a break from that! Recommended to all fans of Fredrik Backman ‚Äì chances are, you‚Äôll feel the love.""Humanity has many shortcomings, but none is stronger than pride."""

Beartown is, among other things, all about hockey. The lives of those who inhabit this small town are lived around the games, the practices, all the working out in-between. What little funds that are raised there seem to be raised to fund their hockey teams. Everyone makes sacrifices for the team, the game. Teachers, mothers and fathers, siblings, businesses all make sacrifices. The ones who pay with their time, as well, are the boys on the teams, their families, their coaches, and their leaders. Hockey rules all. Of all those players that excel on and off the ice, there are a few that stand out, but Kevin Erdahl is really their star player. He has everything on the surface going for him ‚Äì his grades are good, he‚Äôs popular with the guys - and girls. His family is one of the wealthiest in town. Beartown knows it needs players like Kevin to lift this small town out of the slump it‚Äôs been in for too long. With a win in the semifinals of the junior tournament, they‚Äôd get attention, maybe more money would trickle down as a result, maybe even the long wished for hockey school this town needs. They all know with a big hockey school in town the rest would follow. The shopping malls, new and improved roads, more money means more jobs, too, something they desperately need. But it all depends on hockey, and hockey players like Kevin, like Benji, even Leo. Hockey is the heartbeat of Beartown.Hockey is never satisfied being part of your life, it wants to be all of it.With eyes aimed only the future, really their future, there are changes being planned, another variation of out with the old, in with the new‚Ä¶ or younger version. The older coach, Sune, will be gone because he gives long speeches about them playing with their hearts, whereas the junior team coach‚Äôs speech consists of one word: Win. And then there‚Äôs also the team‚Äôs GM, Peter Andersson. A former Beartown player who made it to the big leagues, and returned when that dream ran its course. Peter and his wife Kira, a lawyer, have a daughter, Maya, 15 years old, and a son Leo, 12. Leo, of course, plays, and loves, hockey. Maya plays guitar, but life still revolves around hockey, everywhere in town, in her life. Maya‚Äôs best friend who practically lives with them is Ana. And then there's another boy, another hockey player, Amat, who has a somewhat secret crush on Maya. Parties, school, friends, her life, their lives‚Ä¶ Life, really, revolves around hockey. They can‚Äôt even begin to imagine a life without hockey. Why does he care about hockey? Because his life will be silent without it.There is so much more to this story that seemingly appears solely devoted to hockey. There is devotion, single-minded devotion, like a religion, a way of life. One can find similar devotion in other areas of life, other sports, other avenues like reading, or television or video games, but those don‚Äôt lend themselves to participation with others, groups of people. An entire town. Devotion to a cause, to a vision of the future might ultimately be a crack in the armor of a small town. What is a town but a place where people live their lives and dream their dreams? What happens when choices have to be made? What, or who, is sacrificed ‚Äì and why?Belonging, that need to feel a part of something bigger, to include those chosen few who share our thoughts and hopes and dreams. If not to be ‚Äúin with the in crowd‚Äù then to find our own crowd where we are seen for whom we are.Loyalty is tied into belonging, to being part of a tribe where we feel at home. Loyalty can be a wonderful trait, but it can also lead people to make decisions based on the wrong criteria. Sometimes making a choice between two roads leads you far, far astray. I‚Äôve read all of Fredrik Backman‚Äôs books ‚Äì at least those that I know of. This isn‚Äôt really anything like A Man Called Ove, or My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She‚Äôs Sorry, or Britt-Marie Was Here, or And Every Morning the Way Home Gets Longer and Longer - but at the same time it has all the elements of each of those that made them work so well. His ability to deliver that common ground with a character and have you rooting for them, feeling as if you know them, and ultimately to loving them.

38,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie,Rating 5 out of 5,"Beartown by Fredrik Backman is a 2017 Simon & Schuster publication. If you are honest, people may deceive you. Be honest anyway. If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfishness. Be kind anyway. All the good you do today will be forgotten by others tomorrow. Do good anyway.Fredrik Backman won me over with ‚ÄòBrit- Marie was Here‚Äù. I have since read most of his other books, or at least have them in my ‚Äòto read‚Äô list, which means I feel I have become accustomed to the author‚Äôs style of writing by now. However, when this book was released, gossip and loud whispers suggested this one may be a little bit of a departure from what I was used to. However, I trusted the author enough not to let that deter me. Still, even with those advanced warnings, I found myself ill prepared for the deep impact this novel would have on me. Hockey is the life blood for ‚ÄòBeartown‚Äô, a small community without much else going for it. While, hockey is ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩjust a game‚Äô, it takes on new connotations in Beartown. The junior team is preparing for the semi-finals, and the entire town is beside itself over it. The story centers around the team, the coaches, and their families who are affected by the town‚Äôs fever pitch excitement. We know something went horribly awry from the very beginning. This knowledge creates a sinister and edgy feeling that followed me from start to finish. I understood the mentality of the hockey enthusiast, not because I know the first thing about hockey, because I don‚Äôt, but because I‚Äôve seen that type of hysteria first hand in my own hometown, only with football being the sport of choice. That a sport can become like a God to be worshiped, that it is responsible for keeping the town afloat, by becoming a source of influx of revenue, it‚Äôs success making or breaking the livelihood of the coaches and their families, and being responsible for the morale of the residents in general, is distressing. But, to see kids living their lives without a spotlight on the arts or education, or presented with other opportunities is sad enough, but also seeing them forced into carrying such a heavy burden on their young shoulders is a disturbing and troubling setup. However, not everyone is defined by the game of hockey in Beartown. Ironically, they seem to end up being the ones impacted by it the most. Despite the much darker tone of the novel and the high pitch emotions involved, it is important to see the loyalty, the integrity, the courage and intelligence of those who stand up for what is right, consequences be damned. It is uplifting to see family stick by each other, to see those priorities in place, to see rock solid friendships, unlikely heroes, and unconditional love at its finest. The cast of characters still embodies the author‚Äôs trademark quirkiness at times, but in this novel he doesn‚Äôt mask the sadness, anger, or other emotions behind the offbeat charm or dysfunction of the characters, like we‚Äôve seen in the past. To do otherwise would have been an injustice to this story and I feel the author approached this material soberly, handled it with great care and precision, and nailed the situations, as they played out in an all too realistic fashion. The justice we all feel is necessary doesn‚Äôt take place in the orthodox way, but in some ways the powerful equalizer that takes its place is enough to satisfy me. I liked the ending, was pleased by the way things worked out, and the powerful way the author allowed the suspense to build to an almost unbearable pitch while soothingly assuring us all will be well. I‚Äôm not a person who believes an author must write one dimensional material. It‚Äôs sad that some readers insist they do, often complaining that one book is not exactly like the others he or she as written. I love it when an author steps out and broadens their scope. Sometimes it fails spectacularly, but sometimes it catapults them to an entirely new level. With Beartown, Fredrik Backman has done just that. "

Everyone has a thousand wishes before a tragedy, but just one afterward.
I can‚Äôt believe I almost DNFed this...This is was such a beautiful impactful book that completely destroyed me. It made me feel things. At times I got tears in my eyes, other times I was boiling with rage. I felt those characters pain, struggle, and rage. This is one of those books that you know you won‚Äôt be able to stop thinking about and I freakin loved it.The reason I almost dnfed it, is because of the very slow beginning. The beginning was so freakin slow with a lot of talk about hockey and a wide cast of characters that it was kinda overwhelming, but for some reason I kept reading and kept giving it another chance. And I‚Äôm glad I did, because this book was so much more than hockey!!
‚ÄúAll your best qualities come from the fact that you‚Äôve been raised in a house full of women.‚Äù

I had very high expectations going into this one, and while they were met, I was completely surprised by the way this story went.Turns out I really didn't know what was going to happen, which meant I was constantly shocked.Beartown is a hockey town first and foremost. If you don't like hockey, don't live here. Or at the very least keep your mouth shut about disliking it. Full of colourful characters, ones I loved (Kira, Peter, Maya, Ana, Ramona, Benji) and ones I absolutely loathed with a passion (David, Kevin, Lyt) thankfully there were more characters I liked than disliked or it would have been difficult to power through.It started off relatively slow, setting the scene of this bitterly cold and dying town, filling in the background on all the characters. Because of this, it did take me a while to get into, as there just wasn't a lot happening. But once the story arc began I was sucked in! This town is rocked by a police case and suddenly everyone has an opinion - the town is split in half, and I loved finding out what would happen.At times I was angered by some of the character's behaviour and views, but that is part of what makes this story so great. This is something girls and women suffer on a regular basis - and not being believed is honestly one of the worst things.This story needed to be told, it is something everyone needs to read, understand and come to terms with. Rape is real and victim blaming second nature, and that needs to change!  ""All adults have days when we feel completely drained. When we no longer know quite what we spend so much time fighting for, when reality and everyday worries overwhelm us and we wonder how much longer we're going to be able to carry on.

‚ÄúSometimes the entire community feels like a philosophical experiment: If a town falls in the forest but no one hears it, does it matter at all?‚Äù
Beartown is proudly a hockey town ‚Äî and not much else. A small dying remote provincial Swedish town, where jobs are disappearing and people are moving away, and the future looks bleak. With one exception - hockey. Not just a local obsession of a town with nothing better to do, but a promise of a better future. 
You see, the town has a decent junior hockey team with a star player that is destined to go far. And a lot more that superficial entertainment can hinge on the team‚Äôs success. 
‚ÄúSo how important can the semifinal of a junior tournament be? Being the best junior team around would remind the rest of the country of this place‚Äôs existence again. And then the politicians might decide to spend the money to establish a hockey school here instead of over in Hed, so that the most talented kids in this part of the country would want to move to Beartown instead of the big cities. So that an A-team full of homegrown players could make it to the highest division again, attract the biggest sponsors once more, get the council to build a new rink and bigger roads leading to it, maybe even the conference center and shopping mall they‚Äôve been talking about for years. So that new businesses could appear and create more jobs so that the townspeople might start thinking about renovating their homes instead of selling them. It would only be important to the town‚Äôs economy. To its pride. To its survival.‚Äù
The problem begins when the hope of Beartown, a star hockey player Kevin is accused of raping team manager‚Äôs daughter Maya. And this shatters the previously predictable and quiet life of Beartown, exposing the rifts and the cracks in the proverbial ice and putting neighbors against each other.And it‚Äôs hard to play hockey on cracked ice.



‚ÄúDifficult questions, simple answers. What is a community?It is the sum total of our choices.‚Äù
How far will you go to try to save the town‚Äôs hoped-for future? How far will you go to protect who you perceive as your own? Would you be willing to let the uncomfortable - and criminal - behavior slide for what you may think is a greater good? What matters more - the well-being of one girl or well-being of the town? Can you even phrase a choice like that?
 ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs fifteen, above the age of consent, and he‚Äôs seventeen, but he‚Äôs still ‚Äúthe boy‚Äù in every conversation. She‚Äôs ‚Äúthe young woman.‚Äù
It‚Äôs a fascinating look into the soul of a small town, a community both close-knit and yet torn apart by the weight of resentment and guilt and power balance. The unifying pull of a shared goal and the fierce rejection of those whose goals may differ. The seduction and danger of forming a shared identity that excludes those perceived as a threat to that identity. The darkness that lies within us. The entitlement that money or strength or status or accident of birth bring. The danger of dropping all your hopes and expectations and blame on shoulders too young to handle them.
‚ÄúHate can be a deeply stimulating emotion. The world becomes much easier to understand and much less terrifying if you divide everything and everyone into friends and enemies, we and they, good and evil. The easiest way to unite a group isn‚Äôt through love, because love is hard. It makes demands. Hate is simple.‚Äù
This is ultimately the story of ‚ÄúUs‚Äù against ‚ÄúThem‚Äù (yes, that also is *almost* the title of the follow-up novel, why‚Äôd you ask?). The thin but stark line that divides the two. The reverberations of choices that put you with ‚ÄúUs‚Äù or with ‚ÄúThem‚Äù. The danger and pain and destruction that comes from the divide. 
‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt take long to persuade each other to stop seeing a person as a person. And when enough people are quiet for long enough, a handful of voices can give the impression that everyone is screaming.‚Äù
Everyone thinks of themselves as good people. Nobody goes through life thinking they are ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù. We are excellent at justifying our actions, weaving our narratives that are ultimately redemptive towards our choices and actions. When these choices must be confronted, when a mirror is shoved to our faces and we are forced to take a closer look, warts and all, ‚Äî well, it‚Äôs unsettling and can be met with rage and hostility.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîThis is also a story about loyalty. The painful question of what constitutes loyalty and what constitutes betrayal and what constitutes decency, and knowing right from wrong. The loyalty to those who you mark as your own versus those who you mark as outsiders, those that don‚Äôt belong to your circle, your town, your team. The loyalty that in Beartown is really a synonym for toeing the line. But the question is ‚Äî who sets that line? 
 ‚ÄúThere are few words that are harder to explain than ‚Äúloyalty.‚Äù It‚Äôs always regarded as a positive characteristic, because a lot of people would say that many of the best things people do for each other occur precisely because of loyalty. The only problem is that many of the very worst things we can do to each other occur because of the same thing.‚Äù
This book is a slow character study, a character ensemble that shows us the good, the bad and the ugly of Beartown‚Äôs soul. The children and the adults. The coaches and the players. The rich and the poor. The winners and the losers at the game of life. Adults who can get so engrossed in a game played by their children in this hockey town that little else matters.The standout for me was, of course, Benji. Benji - the difficult young man with big heart and heavy secrets, who does not hesitate to choose between loyalty and decency, and who is destined for either something really good or the darkest possible end ‚Äî and I‚Äôm hopeful about where he eventually lands.
‚ÄúWhen Benji heads out into the last snowfall of the year and the door closes softly behind him, the bass player thinks how true that is. Benji isn‚Äôt like him, but he‚Äôs not like the people who live here either. Benji isn‚Äôt like anyone else at all. How can you not love someone like that?‚Äù
It‚Äôs an unsubtle book. You never doubt who you are supposed to sympathize with and which side there is to take. The capital-M Message is delivered over and over again. But subtlety is not the point here. The point is human decency, and Backman delivers on that front. I also have to mention the translation. A hallmark of any good translation is making readers forget that they are reading a translated work ‚Äî and I certainly forgot that it was not a book originally written in English. And that‚Äôs the highest praise for a translated work.4 stars. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

December 2022 is my ""Winter/Christmas Month"".Praises:1. once again, author Fredrik Backman shows his mastery of developing each and every one of his characters with finesse! When they can make me feel hopeful, angry, sympathetic, vindicated, etc., well, I know that Backman has done his job! I especially appreciated the compelling female characters;2. I can't get over Backman's writing style - he delivers with a gut punch! From a hard-hitting beginning to ominous chapter endings, this dark, heavy read often blew me away!3. incredibly well-researched in so many aspects! The sickening mentality of ""hockey culture"" left me angry and frustrated. It is so authentic that it strongly reminds me of how Hockey Canada is currently handling many of these exact same issues; and,4. so many thoughtful quotes! A couple that made me stop and think included:"" ... most people don't do what we tell them to. They do what we let them get away with.""""There are damn few things in life that are harder than admitting to yourself that you're a hypocrite.""Overall Thoughts:I'm not a huge hockey fan, but I know some of the basics. I enjoy watching the Edmonton Oilers if they're playing in the Stanley Cup playoffs, and we will go to the local arena every once in awhile to watch our 16-year-old grandson play in the net. Two other grandsons no longer play due to the ""politics"" and the bullying.This story felt personal at times. It will definitely stay with me a long time.Recommendation?Such a gut-wrenchingly real and raw story! I didn't know what to expect! We all like to think that we would take the high road, but it makes me wonder ... how would we truly react in situations like these?A must-read!"

We are the bears! We are the bears! We are the bears, the bears from BEARTOWN!
I'm going to need to get around to reading A Man Called Ove because this is my second disappointing encounter with Fredrik Backman, even though everyone raves about him. I really didn't like Beartown: it puts stereotypical characters into a contrived situation, and by layering on a manipulatively emotional crisis, it pretends to explore a moral situation that, in fact, has no shades of grey: I'm trying not to give anything away, so I will say cryptically: Just writing ‚ÄúThe town is this way, so when something happens to challenge the status quo, you can kind of see how people would ignore what's right to preserve what is‚Äù doesn't actually set up a moral quandary ‚Äì the reader knows what's right, and I would suspect that in 2017, so do all of these characters, no matter where they live. Take away the exploration of a moral quandary, and there's no reason for this book to exist. In addition to not liking the plot or the characters, the line-by-line writing was weak (and, perhaps, this was just weak translation). To begin, nearly every chapter begins with an aphorism:
It's only a game. It only resolves tiny, insignificant things. Such as who gets validation. Who gets listened to. It allocates power and draws boundaries and turns some people into stars and others into spectators. That's all.
Beartown begins as a story about a small town, deep in the woods of Sweden, where hockey is everything: entertainment, economic engine, the ticket out of nowheresville. We meet the players on the Junior team who are carrying the burden of the whole town's dreams as they advance to the semifinals of the National Championship, and watch as they are treated like gods everywhere they go (at home, at high school, about town), and obnoxiously, take that as their due. Backman stresses that this is just the way it is in Beartown: you either get it or you don't understand hockey. I may not live in the woods of Sweden, but I am Canadian and hockey saturates our culture, too. So when one of the players commits a crime and the community rallies around him as though the game is more important than any one individual, I just didn't buy it: I may not personally be a hockey mom, but I work with one whose entire social life revolves around her sons' games (she and the other moms call themselves ‚ÄúThe Funbags‚Äù and follow every game with wine and cheese), and I work with another woman whose son was drafted into the NHL last year ‚Äì and neither of them would clean up a crime scene to protect their sons' hockey careers. Cue another mawkish aphorism:
Soon Maya won't be Kira's little girl anymore, and then Kira will become Maya's little old mom. It doesn't take a lot to be able to let go of your child. It takes everything.
And a questionable sense of humour:
The president is sitting at his desk eating a sandwich the way a German shepherd would try to eat a balloon filled with mayonnaise.
And I just didn't like the writing. At one point, Backman writes of ‚Äúneither this, nor this, nor that‚Äù (as though you can use ‚Äúneither‚Äù with a list of three things), or when Amat and Zacharias reconcile and it says that ‚ÄúAmat hangs his jacket on the same hook where he's hung it every day since he was old enough to reach up there for himself‚Äù ‚Äì put aside that that should be ‚Äútall enough‚Äù instead of ‚Äúold enough‚Äù, Amat had obviously not been hanging his jacket there every day for the two weeks that they weren't talking to each other; and when I'm rolling my eyes at the small details, I definitely can't buy into the larger picture. More things that made me roll my eyes: Sometimes Backman introduces a detail that is only important in its own chapter. In one, he writes that offering someone a cup of coffee is this buttoned-up town's way of saying ‚ÄúWill you be my friend?‚Äù And later in that same chapter, one woman is taking out the garbage and no one in the neighbourhood offers her a cup of coffee, while another woman doing the same has several doors fly open followed by several offers ‚Äì not only is this too painfully literal a plotpoint, but it's never revisited; no one ever offers the first woman that cup of coffee later on when she is redeemed. Another chapter begins with noting that when children first learn to hunt, they are told the difference between predators (who have forward facing eyes) and prey (whose eyes are spaced apart to look for danger), and that two girls who heard this ‚Äúlesson‚Äù then spent the afternoon looking at themselves in the mirror, trying to decide which type they were. Later in this chapter, an intense man enters a room and it's written that his eyes face forward. Also, after listening patiently to Kira's problems, it is noted that her work colleague has eyes that are spaced far apart (I have no idea why she would be the ‚Äúprey‚Äù in this conversation). I hated this. And I hated that this woman is only, and repeatedly, referred to as Kira's colleague, and I hated that there's a character who is only and repeatedly, referred to as a man in a black jacket. This is already more than I wanted to write about a book that flat out annoyed me, so I will end by saying that I do not recommend Beartown (but will add that I work with another woman ‚Äì a retired teacher who found it all plausible ‚Äì who loved it)."
46,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26175098-christine,Rating 5 out of 5,"Simply put‚ÄîBeartown is a masterpiece. Fredrik Backman really hit this one out of the universe. I have read superb book after superb book this year, but Beartown just rose to the top of my 2020 rankings, which is quite a feat. The book starts out slow with many introductions and the laying of a huge amount of groundwork for all the threads that eventually come together. I am definitely not a hockey fan though I enjoy other sports. I thought those issues might influence how I related to this book, but no, that turned out to be sheer nonsense. So though I initially thought my string of 5 stars for Backman books might be broken, that certainly wasn‚Äôt going to happen. The strengths of Beartown are too copious to count. The most remarkable to me is the griphold Mr. Backman seems to have on the nature of the human soul. He deals with children, teens, young adults, middle-aged adults and the elderly. He writes about girls, boys, men and women. He tackles right from wrong and good versus evil. He addresses love, hate, ambition, fear, inadequacy, courage, loyalty, deceit, and lies, all from numerous vantage points. This man understands being human no matter who the human is. I find that just extraordinary.Another highlight for me is the sense of place. I felt I was there deep in the forest, on the hockey rink, in the bedroom that fateful night, on that street corner under the streetlamp. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.I cannot believe this book is a translation. Major kudos to Neil Smith who did the translation for Mr. Backman. Mr. Smith is an outstanding writer all on his own.And that epilogue. That beautiful multichapter epilogue. It jumped from scene to scene, character to character, in a very unusual and powerful way. It wasn‚Äôt called an epilogue per se, but it was the best damn epilogue I have ever read. I am dying to read Us Against You. But I want to prolong my relationship with Mr. Backman as I have just about finished his works. Therefore, I will fit in something else in between. Because of the position I am putting this next book in, it will be the best one I can find available (turned out to be Where the Crawdads Sing‚Äîscore!). As many of my Goodreads friends have already promised I too will read everything Mr. Backman writes.Many thanks to Hennepin County (MN) Public Library and the Libby App for lending me an e-copy of this book."
47,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/97546350-giorgia-reads,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is 4.5 stars  for me. I don‚Äôt want to review this book based on anything but how I felt about the subject matter, how it was treated by the author and the type of writing that gave the story life. And, right off the bat I can say that all those things were done so very well. But before I get into that, I have to acknowledge one thing: I have never read a book with so many characters AND more importantly, I would have never thought that kind of crowded gathering of voices would be so easily assimilated by the story without making the plot shallow which happens when there are too many opinions and points of view.This was definitely emotional and I think that due to the subject matter I am not entirely objective. - rape stories are hard to read about because the society we live in is not always kind or just to those who have suffered that ordeal which is why going into the story I was already geared up to feel a lot. This book did bring about a maelstrom of feelings and opinions. At times I was sad, others hopeful, but most of the time I was moved. The pacing was slow, tense and there was a very atmospheric vibe to the writing. I believe that combination worked well for the subject matter as well as the setting which is a small town and very tight knit community. I read this book slowly and so I wanted to take my time and write a detailed review because there are a lot of observations to make and a lot of emotions to unpack. Ultimately I decided to leave it here because I don‚Äôt want to use my review to make a statement but rather to praise it for being a book worth reading. "
48,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40997852-nicole,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book hit me like a bucket of ice cold water.How long has it been since a book truly surprised me?? So long! Years. I know my reading taste pretty well and almost always know I‚Äôm going to like/dislike a book beforehand. In most cases, I‚Äôm indifferent nowadays and my ratings range between 2 and 4 stars.People say if you know you won‚Äôt like a book why bother?? This is why I still read books I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to like. To find ones like Beartown. I knew many loved it but I didn‚Äôt think that famous writing style will work for me. I loved it.Want to know why this book is so good? Because the characters are super realistic. The narration style will keep you captivated. Sure, it might not work for everyone. I won‚Äôt do this book justice. Just read it and judge for yourself. You‚Äôll probably like it. This isn‚Äôt enough to motivate anyone so let me tell you a bit about me. I love reading fantasy. I struggle with reading fiction more often than not. Hence, I mostly listen to fiction audiobooks. (PS: this book would make a nice audiobook but no, it so much better read instead).  I assumed this will be 2 stars read. 3 at best. And I have pretty good damn instincts when it comes to books, or at least books I know won‚Äôt like. And books I believe I‚Äôll love. This book belonged to the first category. But everyone was reading Backman on Instagram and if there‚Äôs something I try to do (call me materialistic or whatever you want) is reading what‚Äôs popular at the moment. I‚Äôd be able to know what people are talking about and then agree or disagree. A friend advised me to start with this book -which I had no intentions whatsoever of reading. A few weeks later, I did. And here we are.  I know many don‚Äôt like first-person narratives but it always makes it easier for me to read a story. The book told from the third perspective takes time to get into. But here? It‚Äôs even worse. The narrator is omniscient. It‚Äôs not like Backman simply jumps from one mind to another at the same time but more like tells the story of many characters. For some, it‚Äôs just one chapter or less. Others stay with us throughout the story. It‚Äôs not like the characters were telling us the story but rather the narrator telling us about them. And damn if I don‚Äôt hate it when authors jump from one pov to another and ‚Äúknow it all‚Äù. The first 35% (or so) almost nothing happens. Backman is simply telling us about several characters in his story. How boring. Even later, there isn‚Äôt a whole deal that‚Äôs happening. All these are exactly what I expected before I started this book and they were all there.  Yet I was never bored. I loved the writing style; it was so relaxing and calming. I‚Äôm not sure how to describe it but reading this book was peaceful (please don‚Äôt confuse it with the story itself because the main topics was rape and it was handled very well. It was difficult to read those parts and I was so angry at some people). But I was living in this small cold Swedish town and I was rooting for the hockey team like everyone in it.I cared about our flawed characters a lot. Well, most of them. And Benji.I loved the narration style.  I was always on the edge of my seat. The hockey match? It‚Äôs been so long that I was so excited/omg who will win/please you win. And I don‚Äôt remember ever feeling so anxious and worried about a sports match in books. I grew to love hockey with our characters. I couldn‚Äôt stop reading. From chapter one the writing was so captivating and the story (EVEN IF NOT MUCH WAS HAPPENING) very interesting that I thought ‚Äúit‚Äôs too good, weird I‚Äôm liking, what‚Äôs wrong with me? It‚Äôs fine Nicole, it‚Äôll get worse don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù The Swedish setting and jokes. Ha. So I know a lot about two countries other than mine (neighboring countries excluded): the USA and Sweden. And I know how Swedes can be. I appreciated the humor very much.  Honestly, every reason I expected to work against this book worked for it. The other book that slapped me quite hard on the face was in 2015. I hope the next book won‚Äôt be in 5 years now too. I recommend this book to anyone. I wanted to add this book to my all-time favorites but I don‚Äôt think I will. Though I doubt I‚Äôll read a better book this year. We shall see"

51,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/79324789-nzlisam,Rating 5 out of 5,"Bang. Bang. Bang-bang-bang is a familiar noise among the residents of Beartown. But, instead of being met with annoyance and irritation, it‚Äôs a welcome intrusion, a sound that signifies ice hockey. Because in this small Swedish town miles from anywhere, a successful youth hockey team is vital to this town‚Äôs survival, therefore is valued and prioritised above all else. So, what happens when a terrible crime is committed, one that divides the town, and threatens the future of Beartown hockey, a sport they are so reliant on?What can I say about Beartown that hasn‚Äôt already been said by its many fans worldwide? Well for starters I can confirm that this phenomenal contemporary masterpiece is deserving of all the hype and praise it has received (and more), and I will be singing its praises ‚Äòtill kingdom come. Everything about it 100% worked for me.The writing was pure inspiration ‚Äì I can‚Äôt count the number of times a sentence or paragraph moved me to tears or had me grinning from ear-to-ear, marvelling over how bang on it was, and how accurately it nailed the emotion or feeling the character was experiencing. I don‚Äôt play sports. I don‚Äôt follow sports. I don‚Äôt watch sports. Yet, I was utterly enthralled by the hockey games, and sports culture, which to me signifies just how incredible the writing was.Beartown encompassed both the positive aspects of competitive sport, and the darker, seedier underbelly. The pro‚Äôs being teamwork, friendship, positive mentors, and a sense of belonging and inclusion. And, on the flip side, toxic masculinity, jock culture, glorifying athletes, entitlement, bullying, and hazing. This novel included many important social issues, particularly those relating to teenagers in social situations, as well as a high school setting. So, even though Beartown included several adult POV‚Äôs, it did tend to focus on teenage angst, drama, and slang, so readers who don‚Äôt tend to like YA may not be as enamoured by this as I was. Although, as I mentioned, the writing is perfection, so if it can turn me into a hockey lover, then it can turn you into a YA one.The formatting was unique in that it read like you were watching Beartown as a TV series with short scenes, and multiple switches between many POV‚Äôs per chapter. And, I absolutely loved it, as you always knew what everyone was up to especially during crucial, impacting moments, and action-driven scenes. I also loved that the first section was a day-in-the-life of the residents of Beartown, where we followed the characters around, experiencing their work/school/home/sport routines, relationships to one another, and the layout, gossip, and culture of the town.I never wanted Beartown to end, am definitely not ready to say goodbye to these unforgettable cast of characters, and luckily I don‚Äôt have to, as there are two more sequels to savour ‚Äì Us Against You, and The Winners (out later this year)."

Because there‚Äôs an ice rink on the cover and you might not be interested in hockey.You might see this book in a store and notice there‚Äôs an ice rink on the cover.

Because there‚Äôs an entire world in this book. And how tragic it would be to walk past it and never notice.This book managed to make me care for the characters about thirty pages in. Because instantly they don‚Äôt feel like characters in a book. They feel like people. They feel real. I liked them, I laughed with them. And then this book decided to shatter me and tear me into pieces.With the first paragraph Fredrik Backman makes absolutely clear that something bad will happen.""Late one evening toward the end of March, a teenager picked up a double-barreled shotgun, walked into the forest, put the gun to someone else‚Äôs forehead, and pulled the trigger.This is the story of how we got there.""So I knew there would be a mystery and probably some suspense. I just never expected how much heartbreak there would be along the way.This was a very emotional read. I got so angry at times I wanted to scream. Because the author wanted me to. I felt relief in other moments. Because the author wanted me to. I felt some joy and also a lot of pain. I felt exhausted. And when I had finished reading it I felt just amazed and happy I didn‚Äôt walk past Beartown.This is not a book that's primarily about hockey. It‚Äôs about group dynamics. How one thing leads to another. How bad things can happen because you missed your opportunity to do or say something. Maybe because it didn‚Äôt feel important to you in that particular moment. Or it felt important but you couldn‚Äôt summon up the courage to act or speak.It‚Äôs all just a game. Until it becomes serious.Until it becomes pride and love and pain and joy.Until it becomes compassion and shame and greed and hatred.Until it becomes friendship and rivalry and injustice and revenge.Until it becomes hope and despair.Until it becomes life.Until it might break you.Until you might refuse to be broken.""What you create, others can destroy. Create anyway."""
53,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59357213-sam,Rating 5 out of 5,"Believe the hype.  Beartown is one of those rare novels that leaves you swollen with feeling and utter satisfaction, and yet entirely sad and almost disappointed that the story had to end, even though you wouldn't have wanted the author to change or add a single thing. For me, that's the highest level of love I can have for a novel, and I was honestly stunned by my level of engagement with and adoration for this book. 5 stars, no halves or equivocation, a completely fulfilling reading experience that I'd recommend to anyone and everyone.Fredrik Backman executes his portrayal of a small, hockey-obsessed, economically challenged town and its inhabitants perfectly: the characters are well-drawn and specific and believable, the details and histories and culture woven into the dialogue and actions throughout. But the beauty of this novel is that Beartown, Sweden is Beartown, Sweden while also being Anytown, Anywhere. It achieves a fantastic combination of the specific and the universal, the small town and the small story and the one hockey team and the one fateful act that are individual and personal. Yet it transcends this to also encompass larger meditations on sport, tribe, the family we choose and family by blood, parent-child relationships, guilt versus innocence and when and why it's important and to whom, suffering, success and failure, fitting in and fitting out, good and evil versus right and wrong, what it means to come of age, what it means to be left behind in a rapidly changing world, what people are and aren't capable of being or becoming. It's a read that is easy and entertaining in terms of its writing style, but also presents common yet challenging ideas, again amazing and confounding me with its effortless simplicity and profundity at the same time, and for that to happen takes tremendous hard work and craft by Backman. I marveled at how skilled Backman (and his translator) were to keep multiple perspectives and characters popping in and out of the narrative, yet I was never confused and always pulled forward into the plot. And the characters are rich and my need to find out what happened to them was real and urgent and necessary. I won't soon forget Maya's inner strength, the tried and tested love between Kira and Peter, Benji's concealed empathy and understanding, the pain and redemption in the fluctuating friendships between Amat and Zacharias and Amat and Bobo, and even the lesser characters that are still so very real and important and meaningful: Benji's sisters, Ramona the bar owner, Bobo's parents, Amat's mother, Kevin's mother, Sune the A-team coach. Backman answers his own question, 
sometimes the entire community feels like a philosophical experiment: If a town falls in the forest but no one hears it, does it matter?
 Yes, because all the people in it matter, their faults, flaws, hopes, dreams, actions good and bad, passions, fears, failures. And even though they are such fully realized characters, it's hard not to recognize yourself and larger strands of the human experience in each of them. This was something that once I started, I did not want to put down. Ultimately, I was completely entranced by Beartown, and Backman's novel is an exemplar of how to cover the whole of the human condition in a single story; how to juggle and wrestle with the myriad emotions and motivations of individuals and collectives, big ideas like love and loyalty and small needs and desires like wanting a better job for one's parent who is increasingly in pain working as a cleaner. This read is astonishing, emotional, entertaining, and just rang so true. And despite me never reading or having an interest in A Man Called Ove, I take notice of books my Goodreads friends seem to universally rate 5 stars, and was intrigued enough to try Beartown. Backman's other books didn't seem like they'd be for me, so a small town obsessed with hockey seemed a bit more up my alley than what I perceived to be his canon of old curmudgeons on quests and doing adorably cranky things. But after having read Beartown, I may need to get outside of my box and pick up Ove: I was impressed and delighted by Backman's talent and storytelling, and I am so happy he has a backlist I can discover in the interim between this and his next book.
We burn and bleed and cry, fully aware that the worst the sport can give us, in the very best scenario, is incomprehensibly meager and worthless: just a few isolated moments of transcendence. That's all. But what the hell else is life made of?
Beartown will give you 336 pages of transcendence. And at the same time show you exactly what people, what towns, what life is made of. READ THIS BOOK.-received an ARC on edelweiss, thanks to Atria and Simon & Schuster."
54,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17957823-erin,Rating 5 out of 5,"All the feels! Well, I am going to be honest.  I was terrified to read this book.  A strange thing to say because if a person were to look at my ""read"" shelf, I have obviously highly enjoyed Fredrik Backman's books. I love his writing and his characters seem to connect with my soul. It was the plot- the fact that that this book would talk about a small town and its obsessive love for hockey. A game that I loved so much growing up but have slowly lost interest in as I have grown older. As I began reading ""Beartown,"" I could feel that this book was hitting pretty close to home. In fact, Backman was talking about my hometown. Something I am sure many people can say!  Beartown isn't close to anything. Even on a map the place looks unnatural... Either way the town is losing. It has been for a very long time since it won at anything. More jobs disappear each year, and with them the people, and the forest devours one or two more abandoned houses each season.  Now the focus of this book is a hockey town, its players, coaches, and family members. As the sister and sister in law of hockey players, and the daughter of a hockey coach, I can easily say that Backman captures the very essence of the hockey world. To the perfect pitch! Late one evening toward the end of March, a teenager picked up a double barreled shotgun, walked into the forest, put the gun to someone else's forehead and pulled the trigger. This is the story of how we got there. Yes, it's a dark story too. For what it says about false idols and rape culture and communities and what is truly important. A story that is all too common, but that we(society) must continue to examine. I wish I could say that the actions of the different individuals in the story was shocking, but it wasn't. And that might be the most scary part of all. Definitely one of my favorites of 2017!"

My gosh are you going to love this. (I am that kind of person).  I‚Äôm not going to lie to you, I really did lose count of how many times I repeated the ending because of how hopeful it made me feel in the middle of a pandemic.It was personally not a heavy read but it was definitely an emotional one, or maybe Backman is just an expert on making me feel things. The book puts a lot of light on the mental health of teenagers but also parents raising children at this time of their lives.
‚ÄúThere is a town in a forest that loves a game. There‚Äôs a girl sitting on a bed playing a guitar for best friend. There‚Äôs a young man sitting in a police station trying not to look scared. In a hallway in a hospital, a nurse passes a lawyer talking loudly into her cell phone. In the stands in an ice rink, in a capital city, grown men and women are on their feet, shouting that they are the bears from Beartown.‚Äù
The story is the camaraderie brought by a small town, passion for what you do, and what success truly means. Themes on family and community are very forefront, specifically how they live with both the small perfect imperfections and tragedies. This also means it tackles topics like grief and processing sexual assault, and victim blaming‚Ä¶ among other things. I feel like I say that a lot with Backman books. ...AND I WAS THERE FOR ALL OF IT. He is just able to pack so many themes and discussions in a compressed story without it ever feeling like it's too much. It literally feels like you're living these people's lives. I say: ‚ÄúWhere are we from?‚ÄùYou say: ‚ÄúBEARTOWNNNN!!‚Äù*insert rink side crowd noises*Essentially, the plot revolves around hockey and how it brings together these different people. As usual, that's all I think you should know about the plot. This isn't strictly labelled as a mystery but you are going to be left figuring out what led to that scene that happen on the very first page. And to be honest: it's just good storytelling. I want to reread this book in a cabin in the cold woods.
‚ÄúIf you are honest, people may deceive you. Be honest anyway. If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfishness. Be kind anyway. All the good you do today will be forgotten by others tomorrow. Do good anyway.‚Äù
Fredrik Backman‚Äôs writing style is consistent with the two workss I have read wherein he successfully weaves each character‚Äôs background into each other. Especially given the contained settings of the books, it does work really well in my opinion. Anxious People was my first Backman book and while I loved everything about it, I found it a little difficult to connect with on a personal level. And although, these two books tackle somewhat similar themes, I was able to relate to Beartown more because it highlighted the relationships between people who have (mostly) known each other their whole lives rather than strangers who just met.I am officially in love with how he builds up character relationships, dynamics, and developments. It gives me shivers. The book hooks you by telling you the peak of how everything ends but it feels too wild from where the story begins, so you're mind is left actively figuring out how all these seemingly simple plot points will build. I loved the depiction of the effect of sports on small towns, despite being a city girl, the rest of my family come from a province and this made me feel very nostalgic.Where there is Backman, you will find: charming characters, no matter what background he gives them.
‚ÄúCulture is as much what we encourage as what we permit.‚Äù
A significant part of the book discusses the mental downhill that someone who has been raped or sexually abused experience. I won't go into detail to avoid spoilers but it was tackled extremely well in my opinion while still feeling realistic.
""What an uncomfortable, terrible, source of shame it is for the world, that the victim is often left with the most empathy for others.""
Fredrik Backman‚Äôs technical skills in creative writing is on point. The repetitions of the ‚ÄúBeartown‚Äù chant make you feel like you‚Äôre actually part of this town yourself. It made me feel attached to everything that was going on. Not to mention how everything ties back so cleanly.Out of the 2 books by this author that I have read, this one is my favorite and it might be difficult to beat, just because this story felt too much like it was written for me. If you need to know anything else about this book: cold, hockey, small towns, coming-of-age, friendships, bravery, family (it's the whole package as far as themes go).I don't know what else to say. I was feeling all the emotions.‚Ü£ Read this for a cold but cozy, heart wrenching but touching, and overall emotional story that will leave you feeling... optimistic? or rather: leave you looking forward to tomorrow while appreciating where you came from.¬†‚Ü¢
‚ÄúNever do you find friends like the ones you find when you were 15 years old.‚Äù
I thought about that quote longer than I care to admit."

And this, I think, might even be his best so far. What with all the issues covered in its pages, this novel could easily have descended into chaos, but with Backman at the helm, they've all been dealt with perfectly, and not a word has been wasted. The result is beautiful.Can't wait to read the sequel!"

‚ÄúEveryone has a thousand wishes before a tragedy, but just one afterward.‚Äù

Beartown is my first book by Fredrik Backman, and I'll definitely be reading more of his works. This book started really slow for me, and I almost DNF'd it the first 15% because I didn't start out invested, but I'm so glad I hung in there.¬†Once I got into it, it became completely enthralling and I didn‚Äôt want to stop listening. I love hockey books, but this is not the typical hockey book I read. Usually mine are sports romances. This was a book about a town that centered around hockey. It‚Äôs a huge deal in Beartown. When an event happens hat rocks the town, people will have to decide how important hockey really is. This book had so many important messages and it really shook me to my core. One of the reasons I think this was hard to keep up with at the start is because there were so many characters. Once I had who everyone was straight in my head it was much easier. There were characters I couldn‚Äôt stand, and so many that I loved Benji was amazing and I also loved Bobo. This is a hard book to talk about and review. It‚Äôs hard to delve too deep without spoiling the plot, and you definitely want to go into this without being spoiled. This book hit me right in the feels. It truly wrecked me at times. It was a difficult read with some heavy material, but I‚Äôm so glad I read it. I‚Äôm looking forward to the next in this series. 
‚ÄúHate can be a deeply stimulating emotion. The world becomes easier to understand and much less terrifying if you divide everything and everyone into friends and enemies, we and they, good and evil. The easiest way to unite a group isn't through love, because love is hard, It makes demands. Hate is simple. So the first thing that happens in a conflict is that we choose a side, because that's easier than trying to hold two thoughts in our heads at the same time. The second thing that happens is that we seek out facts that confirm what we want to believe - comforting facts, ones that permit life to go on as normal. The third is that we dehumanize our enemy.‚Äù¬†

60,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry,Rating 2 out of 5,"Friday Night Lights, on Ice (Fredagskv√§llsljus, p√• is)HBO Syrupy Swedish SeriesBeartown, a small town isolated in the wilds of Sweden, is counting on its junior hockey team to bring home a national championship. This is The Year. The whole town is excited as many of the residents live, eat and breathe club hockey. Unlike A Man Called Ove, not much about Beartown is subtle, particularly revelatory, or frankly, anything much outside the realm of predictable. Yet, Backman does well enough to provide an admirable story revolving around the rape of a 15-year-old girl by the hockey hero, and addressing the dangers of xenophobia, homophobia and classism. Most of my Goodreads friends loved this book. Perhaps I have seen so many sports movies and read enough sports-themed books addressing similar topics that I wasn't nearly as impressed with this novel as with A Man Called Ove. I'd equate it to a good few episodes of ""Friday Night Lights"" on Ice, portions of which are being produced by The Hallmark Channel pursuant to its not-so-secret plot formulae.The team's 17-year-old star player Kevin is a sure pro prospect and a spoiled rich brat whose dad pays no attention to him except to push him to win [there were just too many of these expected caricatures, or stereotypes, to be a winning novel]. His best friend, a closeted homosexual, is poor and his dad committed suicide when he was young. An up-and-comer speedy skater Amat, a 15-year-old immigrant, lives in the poor part of town with his mom, who works as the club's custodian. Peter Andersson is the club's GM and the town's former hockey star who was a pro for a short while until an injury ended his career. Peter's daughter Maya, 15, has a puppy crush on Kevin.After the team wins the semifinal game--of course, in the last minute after coming from behind--a rowdy party ends with Maya being raped violently by Kevin. Amat is the only witness after unwittingly walking into the room to effectively end the rape. Kevin's best friend passes Maya in his sister's car, sees she is beat up and walking home alone in the cold, but doesn't stop to offer her a ride. These two players face conflicts in the coming days. Kevin's dad tries to buy Amat's silence, and teammates push the two to toe the company line.The fans want to railroad Peter out of town as GM after Maya reports the rape a week later, moments before the bus leaves for the championship game and I'll let you guess what happens in the final. Had Backman been a bit more low-key, he could have made much more out of the ""blame the victim, pack mentality"" of the town's fans and his idea of the ""culture of silence ... foster[ing] a culture of winning."" For example, if you are not clear about Backman's point that hockey players are ""seen more as products than people,"" you are certain to be by the umpteenth reminder.Backman is much better when his writing's more nuanced on themes of alienation and acceptance, particularly of Amat and Kevin's best friend. In the end though, Beartown has way too many stereotypes (rich, poor, and sports heroics) and bordered too often on the maudlin to be a book I could soundly recommend."
61,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5376236-heather,Rating 5 out of 5,4 1/2This book took me by surprise! I was expecting a lighthearted and warm read but it was much more deeper and intense by that!üèí ‚õ∞ This book is much more than hockey. Yes this follows a hockey town and a hockey team but it‚Äôs about the people within these.‚ö†Ô∏è This book does deal with the topic of rape just so your aware.I thought he handled the topic amazing and took a hard look at how people shame the topic and sexism as well. ‚ö†Ô∏è üèíSo yes this book is definitely hard hitting but it‚Äôs also got Backmans quirky writing and has amazing characters that have so much heart.Definitely would recommend!
62,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61624004-emily,Rating 4 out of 5,"I've been putting off writing this review because there's something inevitably painful about revisiting this book. Beartown is a feeble thing. It needs to be treated with utmost caution. There should be a FRAGILE: HANDLE WITH CARE sticker on its cover, or something (but not really, because putting stickers on book covers is a crime and should be punished accordingly).I feel like every Fredrik Backman book is resemblent in one aspect: They all look very soft and friendly but they contain brutally realistic portrayals of topics that nobody quite dares to strip down as fiercely and recklessly as Backman does. I'm fairly convinced that this man was sent on earth to torture millions of people with his literature (in a good way). He knows exactly what to do to evoke any kind of emotion we do not necessarily want to feel; he is a puppeteer of words which allows him to have complete control over the audience at all times. There are very few writers who have mastered their own writing style as effortlessly as he has, and that is very admirable, I think.
‚ÄúNever trust people who don't have something in their lives that they love beyond all reason.‚Äù
Now, Beartown is, like I've already said, no easy thing. It excells in writing (that much we've covered), but what makes it stand out so uproariously from the rest? Maybe it's the flawless character work that makes it impossible not to devote your entire being to these fictional entities. I feel like I formed deep, infrangible bonds with all of the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù that constitute this book; like I went through a whole process of finding new friends (or enemies, respectively) while experiencing this story. That someone should be able to create characters that seem so very real (with their WORDS!) is so astonishing to me.On the topic of authenticity ‚Äî the fact that Beartown, the place, is a made-up thing is almost indigestible to me. You're telling me all these people with their hockey teams and their lives and their dreams...... they do not actually exist? I'm sorry, but frankly, I refuse to believe that. Before I leave I'd like to add that the discussion of sexual assault and its aftermath is very present in this book, so make sure you're comfortable with that topic before you start reading or pick up any other work of Backman's. Take care.

Well that was a ‚Äúbarn burner‚Äù of a read for Norma and Brenda!!4 stars!! For Linda! (So for the purpose of this review 4.5 stars rounded up to 5)BEARTOWN by FREDRIK BACKMAN is a powerful, memorable, emotional, spirited, and an uplifting but yet gut-wrenching novel with some moments of humour thrown in along the way that kept us all engrossed in this tale of a small town community‚Äôs commitment to the well-loved game of hockey. BEARTOWN is a novel that delves deep into the emotional side of the human spirit/human nature which is packed with passages of wise insights and full of wisdom. Brenda started out making notes, changed to underlining passages in the book and finally giving up because there was too many and thought she might as well mark the whole book. FREDRIK BACKMAN explores the emotional, physical, and mental side of the players, and has a remarkable ability to make us see and understand them and how they are seen through the eyes of the community. He had us engaged not only with the players but the community as well. He explores right and wrong, fear and courage, limits and loyalty of friendship, the bond and love a parent has for their children and their worst fear, that left us asking ourselves many questions. Norma and Brenda giggled to ourselves every time Canada was mentioned and wanted to know where in Canada he was actually referring to. It's not like it's that small of a place. Toronto? LOL.Linda who has read and loved all of Backman‚Äôs books did find it started out a little slow and had a little bit too much hockey for her but it did pick up in the second half though. Some of his language and subject matter was a little more colorful than she is used to from Backman. This added to our discussions and the fun we had reading and discussing this book full of awesomeness. Highly recommend this absolutely amazing, insightful, & inspiring novel! This is a favourite read of 2017 for Norma & Brenda!All of our Traveling Sister Reads Reviews can be found on our blog:https://twosisterslostinacoulee.com/"

However I really enjoyed Mr. Backman‚Äôs other books, particularly ‚ÄúBritt-Marie Was Here‚Äù and I have such wonderful Goodreads friends that kept telling me to keep going, so I did. In my eyes, this book outshines the others, and they were great. After getting through the initial introduction of all of the characters, and there are a lot, and getting my head around how a town can exist and put all of their hopes on the shoulders of 17 year olds, I let myself get into the characters and what they had to say. I do live in a place that can get very cold and sometimes dismal, Wisconsin, but have never lived in a small town such as the one described here. I don‚Äôt like hockey, enjoy basketball on the college level, but my four daughters were into individual sports, tennis, diving and gymnastics, big, big time. I met more than my share of parents who want to live through their children and their accomplishments but do so in such a negative way. I remember listening to some moms practically threaten their daughters if they didn‚Äôt ‚Äústay on that beam this time, no matter what it takes!‚Äù There were always parents who complained about the judges, ‚Äúthey just don‚Äôt like my kid‚Äù, ‚Äúthey obviously don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre looking at‚Äù, etc etc. Everyone in this town is on the bandwagon for these young kids to win their junior hockey tournament. They want it to bring more sponsors for the team, a new hockey rink, more businesses in town, etc, etc, all very selfish reasons. The young girls in the town really don‚Äôt seem to be encouraged to do any sports, there is no girls hockey team. Girls aren‚Äôt even expected to like hockey, if they do maybe ‚Äúthey‚Äôre lesbians‚Äù. If they are attracted to the hockey players they are probably ‚Äúsluts‚Äù or ‚Äúgroupies‚Äù. The lack of any strong female role models is really amazing, except for some of the extraordinary mothers who will do anything for their kids, girls and boys. So many diverse characters:Sune, the older coach who has coached pretty much everyone in the town at one time or another. He taught the kids to ‚Äúplay with their hearts‚Äù and gave long speeches.David, the coach of this winning junior hockey team whose only speech to the kids before a game was one word ‚Äúwin‚Äù, that has worked for him so far. He played professional hockey until injuries ended his career. Does he sacrifice some players for the success of others? Kevin the current star of the team and has everything going for him. He gets good grades, is popular with everyone, his family is one of the wealthiest in town. Yet is he happy? Does anyone really know what goes on in his house, his relationship with his parents?Peter is the general manager of the team, of course a former town player. He wants so much for this team to bring the glory back to the town, but at what price? What and who is he willing to sacrifice? He and his wife Kira, a lawyer, have a daughter Maya, age 15, who lives for her guitar and a son Leo, age 12 who of course loves hockey. Amat, the son of an immigrant single mother who works as a cleaning lady and can‚Äôt believe that her son is as good as he is. ‚ÄúShe finds it unfathomable that the boy she gave birth to in a place that has never seen snow was born to play a sport on ice‚Äù. Amat is small but fast and has suffered his share of ridicule for being the smallest and one of the poorest on the team.Ramona, the elderly owner of the ‚ÄúBearskin‚Äù the only bar in town. She has seen it all and knows everyone and their secrets. How much influence does she really have in this town? There are many more characters and they are all, yes all of them, well defined. I came to know them all and could not believe how Ms. Bachman created so many characters dependent on each other and how the story comes together, with an explosive event and all of the after effects. So enough already. If you‚Äôve read this far you must be interested in the book. Don‚Äôt wait, just buy it. You will feel so many emotions it will fill your heart and you won‚Äôt, in the end, want to leave this story.I received an ARC of this book from the publisher and NetGalley."
66,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7234171-jaline,Rating 5 out of 5,"It‚Äôs been some time since I cried so much at the end of a book. What an ending!Right at the beginning we are told that a teenager goes into the forest, places a shotgun on someone‚Äôs forehead and pulls the trigger. This sets the tension and suspense rolling from the very first sentence.We also find out that Beartown is a small town somewhere in Sweden where hockey rules, and the club‚Äôs uniforms are dark green, with white trim, and a brown emblem on the front ‚Äì forest, ice, and earth. The theme of forest, ice, and earth is carried through the book describing variously, the people, the town itself, the hockey club, and how individuals interact with each other.There is a game description roughly 40% into the book that was so vivid that I felt I had been playing myself! After the game there is a party, and at the party a bunch of young teenagers are drinking, competing for status and placement, and by the end of it life will never be the same for many of them.This book is about hockey, but it is also about lifestyle, about parenting styles, about how children grow up making choices that are partly due to how they are raised, but also partly due to their personalities and inner motivation. This book is also about how a town can foster pride in accomplishment ‚Äì and how pride is always a double-edged sword. Pride can be the catalyst for people to excel and pride can also create a sense of entitlement. Actions without consequences. Consequences that lead to tragedies.And where does it stop? Is a line drawn at the forest? In the ice? In the earth? Who draws the line? Who crosses it because it is there? Who has the courage to stop the spiral before tragedy begets more tragedy?This story is one of lives and lifestyles careening out of control and what it takes to bring a town back to its truest self again. I loved this story and if you haven‚Äôt read it yet, you have a wonderful experience ahead of you!"

God it was my second novel by Fredrik Backman but it was so different from his usual style, this one really reach my soul. Beartown is a small town, a hockey town, everyone is obsessed by hockey but dont think it is the purpose of this story, its also about its people and whether you like hockey or not, the author delivers a emotionally-charged story till the end. Beartown is captivated by hockey and I am captivated by this book and its characters. Although I love hockey, it was a significant bonus to be able to learn things I did not know about, the different values, how management works, what it means to be part of a team. I am also not from a small town but Ive felt the experience thru my reading. Backman did an outstanding job creating the story and its fully developed, complex characters. Ive said hockey six times already in this review, Ive become haunted myself with it and I have absolutely NO REGRETS! I cant wait to read the sequel."
68,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5464046-porshajo,Rating 4 out of 5,"Rating 4.5Wow! What happens in Beartown, unfortunately, happens in reality. Probably more times that we know. Just change the sport. I don't know if you can say the people of Beartown are obsessed with hockey. It's more that they live for it, they live and breath it every minute of the day. Beartown is a story that grabs you from the beginning. We follow the local boys hockey team and their quest to win. We follow the coaches and their quest to win. We follow the town folk and their quest for their team to win. But what if something might change that. Protect the team at all cost. I'll not go into anymore detail about this one other than to say just read it. You don't have to know hockey to read it.It's odd that while reading this one, I was remembering the times of my high school. Football was king and the town was crazy. Not like in Beartown, but we were also out in the middle of no where, and people lived for the football team. If you played, you were treated much different from others. The players got a pass on everything. I recall though one teacher did push the football players - she did push that one in 10th grade to read outloud constantly, because he could not read. Yup, he continually got a pass on everything, because the team needed him. And in 10th grade, he had a childs reading comprehension. It's very sad but this does happen.Anyway, I listened to this one via audio and it was fabulous. The narrator did an amazing job and really brought this one to life for me. So why only a 4.5 rating? There are many characters in the book and there is a lot of setup at first. I did not like that within a chapter it moved back and forth and between characters. I got confused a bit who was who. I did have the print version too so I would go back and re-read chapters. I was not a fan of that writing style. And, I'm stingy with 5 stars. I always ask myself, would I read this one again. And for Beartown...No. Don't get me wrong, it's very good. But I know what happens and I just did not feel that it would be a book I would feel the need to revisit. However, I do plan to visit the other books by this author as the man can tell a story. I look forward to reading more from him soon."

BEAR WITH IT (pardon the pun) but this one does require a little patience at the beginning but BOY ! is it a book worth reading for it is as compelling as it is disturbing and certainly makes you think. I came so  close to putting this to one side after reading the first 50 pages as I wasn't keen on all the Ice Hockey details but I trusted my GoodRead friends reviews and knew this book had to have more to give and am so glad I stuck with it as Its the sort of book that when asked in 5 years time ""Did you read BEARTOWN ?  I will certainly remember I did.So well written and the build up is necessary and vital to the story as it sets the scene and this could be any team sport in any country where it's played at a level that the Players, management and community get consumed by every game and the winning of every game becomes paramount. Team sports like football or soccer don't play a huge part in my life as its more solitary sports like golf and running where our family interests lie and yet I am fully aware of the pressure and competitiveness of football even on a small local level so was very easy even for me to identify with this book. However the sport element is only one part of the book, there is so much more to this book and without giving the story away I recommend reading this to find out for yourself.Terrific characters, some I wanted to slap and others I wanted to cuddle. Great storyline with lots to discuss in this one and another book that would make a great book club discussion read regardless of whether you like or dislike the story.So glad I struck with this one as its a book that took me by surprise and another one for my favorites list.I listened to this one on audio and I have to admit I wasn't blown away by the narrator, it was adequate but wish I had a hard copy instead."
70,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was about a hockey team in Sweden. But it could have been about a high school football team in west Texas, or a basketball team in Philly, or a group of young athletes anywhere idolized by a local town.Fredrik Backman‚Äôs 2017 novel is also about a great many other things.It is about ‚Äúus and them‚Äù. At the heart of any contest is a rivalry, even a healthy adversarial role between combatants, between teams, even a race against one‚Äôs self; improving, striving and battling can be good, demonstrating what is best in each of us and providing a reason to become better. But what about when there is only ‚Äúus‚Äù and the distinctions that form the ‚Äúthem‚Äù are arbitrary and without real purpose?It is about the haves and the have nots. No doubt there has always been this peculiarity. There have always been those who had more: power, money, wealth, property, talent, strength, dexterity, athleticism, beauty, etc. Those with want to protect their advantage, and those without seek to gain that which they lack.It is about leadership and courage and loyalty. It is about a natural tendency towards maintaining the status quo, of exclusion and jealousy and fear. Fear of the unknown, fear of doubt, fear of the our own base instincts and a fear of our inability to change.Ultimately, Backman‚Äôs work is also about decency. Our innate instincts towards knowing the difference between right and wrong and good and evil.A powerful work that will inspire strong emotions."

I just find myself wanting it to be over. So that said, I have asked myself despite the rave reviews, why am I doing this to myself? There are books out there that I look forward to reading. Books that make me want to exit my life in order to embrace. I am going to read THOSE books! I may revisit this in the future..... but not now."

A book about a hockey-obsessed small, struggling town and much more. This is about dreams and sacrifices, expectations and disappointments, the privileged and underprivileged, loyalty and betrayal, spirit and passion, the young and old, and hope. Backman introduces a wonderful variety of characters to his book. His character development throughout the story is brilliant. Heroes turn out to be less than heroes, the undistinguished distinguish themselves. This is a gut wrenching story told in an unforgettable manner.Thank you GRF Carol for recommending this author and his books.Highly recommend. A new favorite. Don‚Äôt expect to be able to put this down!5 out of 5 stars."

Cora's review:

Let me preface this by saying that I don‚Äôt know much about hockey and don‚Äôt really follow it. I have a close friend who is really into hockey, so thankfully, I am learning and continue to learn more thanks to his patience to answer what must seem like very elementary questions on my part. This made it easier to understand when Beartown jumped into action scenes during hockey practices or games. But thankfully, there is more to connect with in this book than hockey that really pulled me in. What a heart-wrenching read! It didn‚Äôt take me very long to get through Beartown and the ending made me desperate to find out what happened next. (Thankfully, it looks like Beartown is just the first entry in a trilogy, so I can rest easy!)Beartown is a fictitious small village set in the woods. I imagined that this book could very well have taken place either in northern Wisconsin, Minnesota, or Michigan, notwithstanding the author is of a Swedish background. The town has been losing population and jobs for years and are hoping to attract investment in Beartown by their junior hockey team winning the semifinals (this hasn‚Äôt happened in a while, let‚Äôs just say). So, hockey has understandably become a big deal, with not only outside investment riding on the group of teenagers to win, but peoples‚Äô very identities. Like the people hardened by years of hardship and bitterly cold winters, hockey is a game that matches well with how the people of Beartown see and comport themselves in the world. It‚Äôs a brutally competitive game that rewards much dedication and practice, and not everyone is talented enough to then get signed to professional teams, say, in the NHL. This desperation to win puts the weight of the world on these teenagers‚Äô shoulders, as their coaches are drilling them in practice harder and their parents are laser-focused on doing whatever it takes to help their kids be successful in the sport. Anything.I understand the significant investment on the part of the parents and those who sponsor the hockey teams in Beartown, but wow do bad things happen when this kind of pressure is applied to (famously emotionally stable) teenagers. Also, I don‚Äôt think it justified a lot of the parental back-stabbing and other nasty behavior on the part of the parents towards each other, the coaches, or the referees during the games, even if I understood where these emotions came from. 

‚ÄúHate can be a deeply stimulating emotion. The world becomes easier to understand and much less terrifying if you divide everything and everyone into friends and enemies, we and they, good and evil. The easiest way to unite a group isn‚Äôt through love, because love is hard, it makes demands. Hate is simple. So the first thing that happens in a conflict is that we choose a side, because that‚Äôs easier than trying to hold two thoughts in our heads at the same time. The second thing that happens is that we seek out facts that confirm what we want to believe‚Äîcomforting facts, ones that permit life to go on as normal. The third is that we dehumanize our enemy.‚Äù

One night during a party (no parents supervising, alcohol, drugs, etc.), the unimaginable happens to Maya, the teenage daughter of Beartown junior hockey‚Äôs general manager at the hands of a star hockey player, Kevin.  She is raped by Kevin.  Maya‚Äôs father, Peter, is a gentle giant and current general manager of the team, but not so much when he learns what happened to his daughter, and understandably, he wants justice. When Kevin is arrested before getting on the bus before the big game, the powder-keg threatening to blow finally does. One vocal faction of parents, backed by considerable monetary and social clout, wants to fire Peter on account of his ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù to ruin Beartown‚Äôs chance at glory. A mob mentality quickly sets in, and much of the usual victim-blaming is thrown Maya‚Äôs way, who already is traumatized. Most of the junior team is complicit in this as well. I felt for Maya especially, and her parents as they tried to help protect their daughter in the face of the onslaught. I wanted to jump into the story and explain to all the people frothing at the mouth about a conspiracy that, one, why would anyone make this kind of suffering up? And two, there are things that are more important than hockey. Unfortunately, Maya's case is closed due to insufficient evidence, but the damage has already been done. No one is left untouched by this scandal. Without spoiling the ending, I‚Äôll just say that it‚Äôs well worth the read, as it touches on deep ideas and concepts around winning, perseverance, strength, and standing up for others even when it goes against the grain. Happy reading!-Cora

Suzie's review:

Beartown by Frederik Backman is a novel about the sport of hockey. I never thought that much about hockey, but I read Backman‚Äôs debut novel, A Man Called Ove, and really enjoyed it so thought I‚Äôd give Beartown a go, and I‚Äôm glad I did. As I read Beartown, I found it wasn‚Äôt so much a novel about hockey as it was about something so important to a small town. Something that affects its very existence relative to spirit and commerce, and what happens when it is threatened and how it propels its members to behave in a crisis. Beartown takes place in a fictitious small hockey town. The town lives and breathes hockey and as you read, you get the feel that it is taking place in current time Minnesota, Wisconsin, or Canada. The main character development takes a bit of time and details the lives of teenagers in their junior and senior years of high school. There is a strong desire that the hockey team wins this final championship and become nationally recognized, which would put the town on the map and boost the players to future careers in college hockey and beyond. After a big win, there is a large gathering at the star player‚Äôs home, parents absent, and a tragic event takes place, which then begins the story of how this town copes. The writer did a great job at portraying the emotions and the dilemma that grips the characters and the town as a whole during this dark time. If you are or were an athlete, or are a parent or grandparent to an athlete, you will most assuredly relate to the pull of passions on both sides of this conflict. The author built the characters as regular people who were so familiar and ordinary. I feel as if many of the characters in this book will stay with me for a while. Beartown would be a good book club read as the subject matter is sure to bring a lively and thoughtful discussion. Find this book and other titles within our catalog."
78,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45941903-8stitches-9lives,Rating 5 out of 5,"Full to the brim with emotion, a beautiful book. My first by Fredrik Backman but certainly not my last. This isn't my usual go-to genre but this just caught my eye. I am so pleased I gave it a chance! Sometimes after a lot of thrillers, you need something in between or even alongside just to change the subject completely and wipe the slate clean a little. This book achieved it superbly. I'm thoroughly chuffed I decided to read this novel and I hope others do too. I have heard that this is a departure from Backman's usual topics but I would still love to give his other books a go, an author like this doesn't come around every day. They are already on my TBR list. I know that i've heard of a Man Called Ove before I discovered this book and I understand that it received very good reviews from critics - this will be my next read of his. I didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I did - for one, it's a book that revolves around Hockey and sport is not something that gets my attention at the best of times. Unless it is Tennis, of course. I would also like to note that I have the ARC version of this book entitled - The Scandal - the name it is known under in Canada and the United Kingdom. It is most commonly known as Beartown.Beartown is a snow-covered small-town in Sweden that emanstes with the kind of dark and cold that brings townsfolk together forming a tight knit rural community on the edge of civilisation. The isolation of the community means that they usually either come together - showing that anything is achievable when everyone supports one another or the polar opposite - where the people don't get closer but are pulled apart from one another instead. If they can all just pull together Beartown is on the edge of a revival, a bright new future is up ahead just for them. All of this hope for the future is then put in jeopardy by one brutal act. It divides the town into those who want the act to be kept quiet and never mentioned again and those who feel that they just can't stand by and let that happen. There are those who will risk their future in order to see justice done. It then falls to one young man to speak the truth that no one else wants to hear and find the courage to not just stay silent along with most of the rest. It's time for people to pick a side - you are either or one side or the other. Which side would you be on?You will be surprised how well a book about a Hockeytown actually makes you think about lifes big questions. Right vs wrong, morality, issues of individual loyalty. There are so many ideas in this book that lead you to think about everything in your own life. The characters are admirable and the storytelling masterful. Backman very cleverly lulls you into a false sense of security - you think you are reading something lighthearted or a pretty standard novel but quite soon you establish that his writing gift has made you think a lot more than you had realised! It takes a great author to pull this off."

I FEEL ALL THE FEELINGS!Beartown tells the story of a small town that has pinned it's entire hopes, dreams, and prosperity on the 17 year old boys that make up the Junior hockey team. Hockey is the equivalent oxygen for the simple folk of Beartown. A champion junior team will mean economic prosperity, tourism, and prestige for a town that is described by one of the female inhabitant as place to simply survive but not truly live. How meaningful that statement becomes when a young teenage girl is met with a horrific form of violence against her by the best hockey player in the entire town. The player in which hopes and dreams are built around. Suddenly the readers are brought into a very different side of this seemingly wholesome hockey town; a side that is built around silence, and complicity. As a female, reading this book is not going to be at all satisfying. It will be unbelievably frustrating, upsetting, gut-wrenching and at times you'll want seep into the pages of this novel to yell at every Beartown parent that is allowing and foster this horrible behaviour on the account they want a freakin champion hockey team. You'll want to scream it's just fucking hockey at every character in this novel. But on the flip side you will also read about some amazingly misunderstood characters that are the epitome of hope, love and empathy and because they are in the minority their strength and resilience is even more breathtaking to read about. It's so much more powerful and beautiful to read about characters that have everything to lose but still stand up for what is fair and just. This is the type of novel that will stay with you afterwards. It will both inspire and enrage you. It will highlight the type of person you'll want to be and what kind of influence you will want to have on the world around you. Monsters are not born they are made whether it's through poor parenting or a town that tells them they're god's gift to life or a hockey team that has never learned how to lose, never faced any form of rejection or consequences. It will also show you the importance of language and words, and that a crude joke said in the locker room can have future repercussions that aren't yet seen. I can not rave and discuss how beautiful this novel is and how it should be forced into the hands of every person enough. This has to be my all time favourite novel, and I can't wait to dive into the rest of Fredrik Backman's books because if they are even half as good as Beartown, I know I'm going to love them. This is the type of book that makes you want to be a better person, and isn't that such an amazing feeling to take away from a novel?"

Comparatively, his books that came before seem like warmup acts. This is more fully fleshed, grittier and dark. When we humans witness truth is stranger (and more deadly) than fiction stories and ask ‚ÄúHow did it escalate or come down to this or that‚Äù explanations and answers are few and sometimes far between because we witness the end result taken out of context. This is a full screen vision of how with each step‚Äîone decision at a time, an entire village can raise or level a town and yes, even a child.Faustian bargains are up for grabs as citizens in Beartown with an all consuming passion for hockey come to a moral crossroads of victory or defeat and must choose how much they are willing to sacrifice for what they desire. A win at the final championship will mean salvation for the dying town. But when the star player who can make it happen is arrested after ugly accusations from a fellow student, whose side will they be on? Division ensues, loyalties are questioned, integrity severely tested. How far will parents go to protect and defend their children, to nourish or damage their souls? What are the limits of trust and friendship? With a large cast of characters the issues will get complicated as some see through a glass darkly while for others the scales begin falling from their eyes.Fredrik Backman has become one of my favorite go-to authors for his thoughtful, introspective writing. He gets down to the heart of the matter with themes of loss, loneliness, poverty, abuse, personal identity and accountability, forgiveness, friendship, love, and life‚Äôs opportunities for redemption and change. Thank you NetGalley, Simon & Schuster, and the author for this eGalley."

I didn‚Äôt play, in fact, I can barely ice skate. My 3 brothers played and I could really relate to the bond that the Beartown team forged especially after being successful. From my own experience, Beartown could be about any sport. All for one, one for all is about team spirit. Imagine the courage it would take for one person to split from that tight knit group for their personal beliefs and what is morally right.This novel hit a deeper chord for me on the heels of the #metoo movement. It was emotional from the perspective of a teenager and a parent. It played out tragically and unfortunately realistic. Another aspect of this novel that hit home was the small town setting. I didn‚Äôt grow up in a small town, but I recently moved from one. It‚Äôs true, everyone knows your business. Small communities can come together in times of crisis, but as in Beartown there can be a deep division.I enjoyed A Man Called Ove, Backman‚Äôs previous novel, but didn‚Äôt love it. Beartown hit me personally on different levels and easily climbed to one of my favorite novels this year."

87,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14097149-ginger,Rating 5 out of 5,"ALL THE STARS!!This is the first book that I‚Äôve read of Fredrik Backman and it won‚Äôt be the last. Kudos to his exceptionally writing and storytelling!I went into this book with low expectations. I knew most of you have raved about this book all year but you see, I‚Äôm not a huge hockey fan. I do love sports but was worried that the hockey language and terminology would glaze over my eyes. That it would be a struggle to get through this because, well, it's about hockey!I WAS WRONG friends! Completely and utterly wrong.This book is much more than just hockey. It‚Äôs about the dynamics of a small town and how they focus all their energy into sports. It‚Äôs about standing up for what‚Äôs right when everyone is influencing you to be ‚Äúone of the team‚Äù. It‚Äôs about social injustice and how amazing sports players can get away with horrific acts unlike other students. It‚Äôs about how sports become more important than morality and choosing evil over good for a society.This book really hit a chord with me. You see, I was in sports and lived in a small town. I understand everything about Beartown.Beartown felt very nostalgic and claustrophobic to me while reading this book.I had issues while growing up in this small town in Texas because of football players. They were valued over any other student in the school. Football is king in Texas!I wasnÔøΩÔøΩt royalty because I played basketball, was on the yearbook staff and did one act play.Heh, it's still not football, amirite community?I was a smart, geeky kid that was somewhat athletic but a fucking rebel because I knew that the dynamics in this town were out of whack. Even at age 17, I knew that too much focus went to football.Everyone in the town lived, breathed and consumed football. Nothing else mattered in the school except football players, homecoming and getting to the playoffs.We were the mighty, mighty Comanches! The night before homecoming, the town would do a big bonfire and football players would put war paint on. It was very ""tribal"" and if you were part of the team, you were kings. Football kings!Football mattered more than icky character flaws. Football mattered more than students failing in classes. And if you didn‚Äôt understand this, well, you‚Äôre just not one of the team. You're not one of the community.So yes, I understand Beartown...very, very well.This type of mentality that I grew up with was common in Beartown. It‚Äôs also common in professional and college sports.How many times have you seen a player being accused of physically assaulting a woman? Raping a woman? And then they get slapped on the hand?How many times have you seen a player fail her classes but the teacher suddenly gives her extra days to get an assignment done? Let's just keep this between me and you. Hush, hush.How many times have you seen a player get caught for performance enhancing drugs but he‚Äôs back in action 3 games later?Don‚Äôt get me wrong friends, I'm not trying to shit on sports.I LOVE football! I even like hockey. I love watching the Olympics every 4 years. I love sports and I loved the team dynamics when I played basketball.Team sports teaches patience, disappointment, dealing with adversity and putting others before yourself.Individual sports teaches determination, belief and always striving to be better and not giving up on yourself.These are all great lessons to learn but sports can also teach corruption and looking the other way on talented yet problematic players. Sports can also teach about putting wrong before right because winning has become the most important thing.So, in conclusion, I‚Äôm going to finish up this crazy and rambled review of Beartown. I'm wrapping it up folks!I didn‚Äôt want to say too much about the plot of the book to avoid spoilers. Just know this, it's more than just about hockey.It‚Äôs about standing up for what‚Äôs right even if you‚Äôre standing alone."
88,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26424937-lori,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is a very different book than Backman's others, the three whimsical ones including his charming first novel, ""A Man Called Ove"" and the spare masterpiece of a novella ""And Every Morning the Way Home Gets Longer and Longer"", a meditation on dementia. ""Beartown"" is very serious and not at all spare. It's long, and populated with dozens of characters who live in the town, a forgotten, dying town on the edge of a forest that lives for its hockey team.Many of the characters' backstories are sad, so much so at times reading it felt oppressive. There's the children left behind by a father's suicide, the parents of a dead child, the rape at the heart of the story, the closeted gay on the hockey team, the disrespected immigrants, greedy businessmen, the drunks, the unemployed, unhappily married and generally unhappy and unfulfilled characters. It's a dark novel. But that's just it; life in Beartown, for many, is oppressive. Backman is a remarkably gifted writer and has a deep understanding of, and empathy for, human nature. Beartown requires much more of the reader than Backman's other works and it's well worth it. He is my favorite contemporary writer and his range is remarkable. He can make the reader laugh and cry and blow your mind all in the space of a few pages. This reader is never more engaged and pleased than when she's reading a Frederik Backman book."

90,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/116297579-lau-semi-hiatus,Rating 5 out of 5,"I fell in love with the first page and I loved every single page after it. I wanted a 5 star reading and found a book to carry forever in my heart.Beartown is a small, cold town where hockey is the only thing they are proud of. Everyone is a hockey fan and the teenagers on the team are treated like superstars. Unless you are Kevin Erdahl. Then you‚Äôll be treated like a God. Emotional, heartbreaking and unforgettable, Beartown tells the story of its residents, their past, their dreams, their flaws. Fredrik Backman is a master of characterization. He only needs a couple of paragraphs, a few moments of their life, to describe a character in more depth than other authors in a whole book. There was barely any plot in the first part of the book, yet the way he makes you care about the characters was enough for me to love every single scene. 

‚ÄòDo you think I‚Äôm less of a man because I can‚Äôt fight?‚Äô he whispers. ‚ÄòDo you think I‚Äôm less of a woman because I can?‚Äô she asks.

The trick, besides his immense talent for storytelling, was the fact that no one was flawless. Some of them were far more good than bad -those will make you want to hug them and tell them everything is going to be alright. Others you‚Äôll hate in one scene and love in the next one. Others have more darkness than light on them, and you‚Äôll want them to pay for hurting your favorites.There is a married couple trying its best to make the other laugh even on the hardest times. There is a teenager with sad eyes and wild heart you‚Äôll fall for. There is a bully who‚Äôd accept a beating to support the right side, the losing side.  There are friendships more powerful than love and morals more powerful than friendships. 

'Don't say anything, okay? About me doing a bit of tidying up? I just want to deal with the worst of it.'Peter's throat starts to tighten with shame. He remembers when he used to see the boy collect empty cans from the stand so her mum could afford to buy hockey gear for him the first time, when he was eight or nine years old. 'No, no... of course not, Amat, it would never even occur me to say anything to the other players.''The players? I don't give a shit what you say to the players. Don't say anything to Mum! She gets really pissed off if I do her job!'

My favorite feature, apart from the characterization, is that hope was always present. No matter how hard, painful and horrible a situation was, there was always a small ray of light you could hold on to. There were good and bad acts, fun moments and heartbreaking scenes. As someone who doesn't enjoy extremely sadistic stories, I can appreciate a bittersweet story that tastes like life itself. 

The boy smashed up an entire bathroom and accepted both suspension and liability for the cost of repairs without blinking, all because he didn‚Äôt want anyone to know that [she] had smashed a mirror. He decided that she had bled enough.

 Beartown taught me there are no heroes, only people deciding to do the right thing over the easy one. That good parenting can make great children even better people. That there is always a place for hope and that people can surprise you if you let them. If you enjoy books with sadness and happiness in them and don‚Äôt mind a slow plot in exchange for a brilliant set of realistic characters, I heartily recommend giving Beartown a chance. 

‚ÄòReligion doesn‚Äôt fight, guns don‚Äôt kill, and you need to be very fucking clear that hockey has never raped anyone! But do you know who do? Fight and kill and rape? MEN! It‚Äôs always fucking men!‚Äô

This is not my typical genre for reading and it has to do with hockey BUT I ATE IT UP! This had me so dang weepy and invested so many characters lives! Such a heavy read and you absolutely should check some tw before starting!! Seriously nothing surprises me more than when I start abook I don‚Äôt anticipate to love but it completely blows through my expectations!! I freaking love found family so much and this was found family done at its finest!!EDIT TO ADD: I did a hybrid with this (audio/physical) and it made the experience all that more amazing!! I also wanted to say the first chunk of this book 20ish % is slow but please!!! The pay off is soooo worth it! 
92,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25545124-vanessa,Rating 5 out of 5,"AMAZING!!!! Fredrik Backman knocked this one out of the park! A book that tugged at every emotional heartstring! I felt the gamut of all human emotions. This town makes you FEEL! All the damn feelings. How can a book about hockey of all things get me so excited and turning the pages with equal trepidation and fervour. A book that weaves foreboding tension and builds suspense with complex characters and perfect plot development, you care about these characters, you care deeply about this godforsaken town! BEARTOWN is now part of MY BONES. I'm seriously in love with this author. No seriously...I LOVE him. Book perfection. If you are human you will also love this book! "
93,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5885760-andrew-smith,Rating 4 out of 5,"The book opens with a teaser concerning a teenager who walks into the forest with a double-barrelled shotgun, puts the gun to someone else‚Äôs forehead and pulls the trigger. Ok, that got my attention: who are these people and what prompted this drastic, violent act.So starts this tale set in a remote Swedish town, a town that‚Äôs seen better days. In fact, it‚Äôs on its uppers and the only thing that seems to occupy the minds of most of its inhabitants is ice hockey. More specifically, it‚Äôs an upcoming national semi-final their junior team is about to play. Can the success of this team bring about a turnaround in the fortunes of the town? Will major investment follow and the success of the junior team flow into the senior ranks as a few very talented players come of age?Yes, this is a book about a town obsessed with this particular sport. Or is it? Actually, although the sport features heavily ‚Äì very heavily ‚Äì it becomes clear that what‚Äôs really going on here is something a little deeper, a bit more interesting. As we get to know quite a few people who live in the town, Backman cleverly coerces us to become invested in their plight. These are normal folk, people who might live in our own town, friends and neighbours we all have. And ice hockey might be the local football or cricket team; it doesn‚Äôt really matter, it‚Äôs the people here that really take centre stage.There's loads of great stuff here about friendship, love, support, rivalry, fear and the general ups and downs of living in a small town. But I think sometimes the conversations became rather too homespun for me and (dare I say) I felt that the book veered a little too close to chick-lit on a couple of ocassions. That said, for the majority of the time I was fully engrossed by this tale. And I liked the way loose ends were tied up too, something I‚Äôve seen done badly rather too often.There‚Äôs now a follow-up book sat on my Kindle. Good one Mr Backman, I look forward to visiting this town again ‚Äì quite soon, in fact."

THE PLOT
Beartown has never been the best at anything. However, Beartown has always been known as a hockey town. This book follows Kevin, Benji, Amat, and the rest of the town's junior ice hockey team as they go to compete in the national semifinals. Little does everyone know: they actually have a good shot at winning. The entire town's hopes and dreams rides on these boys' game. After the semifinal, a traumatic and tragic event happens to one of Beartowns beloved daughters, and the entirety of Beartown is thrown into turmoil. Loyalties and friendships are tested, and we really learn to dive deep into what it means to protect the ones we love.
MY THOUGHTS
The Plot: When I said I wanted a good cry, I was not expecting to cry this much. This book warmed my heart, then ripped it out of my chest, threw it on the ground, stomped on it, then picked it back up again. The beginning of this book was VEERRRYYYY slow. I mean the first like 40% was character build-up and really background on everyone. Then we get to the semifinals of the hockey team and from then on it just dove head first. This book singlehandedly shattered my heart. It hit way too close to home and it was a really heavy read. However, I enjoyed it SO. MUCH. The moral dilemmas in this book just hit so hard. Fredrik did such an amazing job at taking a heavy and sensitive topic and handled it so gently and with caution. I didn't think this book would be for me, but I was so happy I picked up it. This book made me so angry at the same time, too. It was so scarily real...the actions that characters made and their thought processes and how it was written just made me angry cry (not in a bad way!!!). I could best describe it as it really gave insight to EVERY perspective during a situation like the one in the book and I'm sitting here thinking, ""Wow, do people really think like that?"" SURPRISE they do and it's infuriating to actually read about. This book does not have a happy ending; this book will break your heart; this book will really make you think. I don't know how you did it, Fredrik, but I applaud you. Back to therapy I go.The Characters: I absolutely adored the way the characters were written in this book. The way Fredrik took the time to really get you to know the characters inside and out like they were real people was amazing. I really connected and resonated with so many characters. They were so well thought out, so well written, so detailed. I'm not going to go through every person individually because there were a LOT but the standouts for me were Ana and Maya, Kevin and Benji, and Amat. These characters specifically really just showed life as teenagers and how loyalties and friendships are tested when life throws a traumatic event at you. The ups and downs of these characters were just so enlightening to read (except Kevin he can go to hell). I truly cannot pick one character as my favorite. They were so unique and each had their strengths and weaknesses. Again, Fredrik, applause.Overall, I will definitely be continuing this series and this felt so refreshing to read as it's not in my usual comfort zone. This book really just hit so close to home and I felt so much comfort and love. I will be holding this book close to my heart.
FAVORITE SCENES AND QUOTES
This sport demands only one thing from you.Your all.Why does anyone care about hockey?Because it tells stories.It's only a game. It can only change people's lives.All adults have days when we feel completely drained. When we no longer know quite what we spend so much time fighting for, when reality and everyday worries overwhelm us and we wonder how much longer we're going to be able to carry on. The wonderful thing is that we can all live through far more days like that without breaking than we think. The terrible thing is that we never know exactly how many.""The only thing the sport gives us are moments. But what the hell is life, Peter, apart from moments?""For the perpetrator, rape lasts just a matter of minutes. For the victim, it never stops.It's light outside now, but that doesn't make any difference. She's scared of the darkness, in the middle of the day.Never again do you find friends like the ones you have when you're fifteen years old.""What can I do, Maya? Tell me what I can do...""""Love me.""""Always.""""Love me like you love hockey and David Bowie?""""So much more, Pumpkin, much, much more.""She becomes smaller and smaller, her organs deserting her one by one.

95,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2922102-blaine,Rating 5 out of 5,"Late one evening towards the end of March, a teenager picked up a double-barrelled shotgun, walked into the forest, put the gun to someone else's forehead and pulled the trigger. This is the story of how we got there.The opening lines of Beartown establish the stakes of a mystery that will unfold by the novel‚Äôs end: a perpetrator, a victim, and a motive. But that mystery is often in the background. Beartown‚Äôs Junior Hockey team is in Sweden‚Äôs National semi-finals, and the entire town‚Äôs future may be at stake as two more wins could bring a new hockey academy and an economic revitalization to the town.The stories here‚Äîof this town, its hockey team, and this mystery‚Äîare told through a wide cast of characters. Peter, the team‚Äôs GM and his wife Kira. Their daughter Maya and her best friend Ana. David and Sune, the Junior and Senior teams‚Äô coaches, respectively. Kevin, the team‚Äôs star player, and his parents. His teammates Amat, William, Bobo, and most of all Benji. Each and every one of these characters is a well-developed, fully recognizable person, flaws and all. Even secondary characters like Tails, Ramona, and Benji‚Äôs sisters are given texture.Beartown uses the relationships between the characters to explore a variety of issues that are apparently common to both Sweden and America. How to best handle a child with an exceptional talent. The trials and tribulations of parenting, and being a sports parent in particular. The corrosive effects of privilege and sexism. The novel is very well written, full of little truisms that set up or enrich the scenes, or foreshadow things to come. And the hockey scenes literally gave me goosebumps. So, obviously, I loved Beartown, and would recommend it to almost everyone. Almost. I don‚Äôt have anything against trigger warnings in book reviews, I just rarely write them myself. But if ever a book needed a warning, it‚Äôs this one. Beartown is about a lot of things, but at the very heart of this novel is a rape. It‚Äôs not offscreen. It doesn‚Äôt happen to a minor character. It‚Äôs not gratuitous, or unnecessarily violent, but it is depicted in a brutally honest way. And because this book is so well written, because you have gotten to know all of the characters before it happens, the scene and its aftermath are simply devastating to read.* I honestly felt like I‚Äôd been punched in the stomach. And as much as it affected me, there will be some people for whom this book simply hits too close to home. So please know that going in.But the very reason Beartown may be too much for some readers is why it should be a must-read for everyone else. It is a great story about many different people and ideas, that is also a searing and unforgettable one on the topic of sexual violence. I know I‚Äôm hardly the first person to recommend this book, but it‚Äôs stunningly good and an instant classic. 5 stars, because I can‚Äôt give it 6.*A sample of the powerfully brilliant-yet-heartbreaking depiction of the rape‚Äôs aftermath:Words are small things. No one means any harm by them, they keep saying that. Everyone is just doing their job. The police say it all the time. ‚ÄúI'm just doing my job here.‚Äù That's why no one asks what the boy did; as soon as the girl starts to talk they interrupt her instead with questions about what she did. Did she go up the stairs ahead of him or behind him? Did she lie down on the bed voluntarily or was she forced? Did she unbutton her own blouse? Did she kiss him? No? Did she kiss him back, then? Had she been drinking alcohol? Had she smoked marijuana? Did she say no? Was she clear about that? Did she scream loudly enough? Did she struggle hard enough? Why didn't she take photographs of her bruises right away? Why did she run from the party instead of saying anything to the other guests?They have to gather all the information, they say, when they ask the same question ten times in different ways in order to see if she changes her answer. This is a serious allegation, they remind her, as if it's the allegation that's the problem. She is told all the things she shouldn't have done: She shouldn't have waited so long before going to the police. She shouldn't have gotten rid of the clothes she was wearing. Shouldn't have showered. Shouldn't have drunk alcohol. Shouldn't have put herself in that situation. Shouldn't have gone into the room, up the stairs, given him the impression. If only she hadn't existed, then none of this would have happened, why didn't she think of that?She's fifteen, above the age of consent, and he's seventeen, but he's still ‚Äúthe boy‚Äù in every conversation. She's ‚Äúthe young woman.‚ÄùWords are not small things."

The melodrama, people! The melodrama!! I laughed out loud a few times at the beginning because I felt like I was reading a prepubescent teenager's diary -- even when the character was, like, a 50-year-old dude. The text is like a soap opera, and I half expected some kind of windblown Arctic Fabio to emerge from the woods wearing nothing but a wolf pelt while carrying, like, five dead women. Okay, okay, that's not quite true: the narrative -- at least through the first 200 pages -- isn't inherently melodramatic, but the prose was ridiculous. Every other paragraph felt like some kind of attention-seeking Facebook status (you know what I'm talking about: the ""I try, and I try, and I try, but I just can't seem to make things right,"" or the ""I miss you, but you don't even know that I exist"" kind of crap). The prose just drips with drama -- and not ""drip"" in a luxurious, drinking-champagne-in-the-clawfoot-tub-while-covered-in-diamonds kind of way, but the ""why is this all wet??"" kind of way). Also, maybe I was just one of those relatively articulate virgin weirdos in high school who didn't say the f-word sixty eight times in a day while talking about my latest sexual encounter, but did anyone else feel like these teenagers felt unrealistic? No? Just the non-sailor-mouthed virgin? Cool. UPDATE: THESE SUPER PROFANE AND PROMISCUOUS KIDS DO EXIST!! Backman must have modeled the kids in this piece after my high school students ;) My apologies for doubting you, Mr. Backman. "
97,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb,Rating 3 out of 5,"2.5 starsI‚Äôm a huge fan of Backman‚Äôs books, and eagerly requested Beartown as soon as it was available. And, although I loved his previous books, I was happy to hear that this one was a departure, with no lovable curmudgeon at its core. Beartown is a small town that is obsessed with hockey, and the townspeople‚Äôs hopes and dreams lie with the hockey team. On the night of the semi-finals a violent crime occurs, one that threatens to tear the town apart. At its heart, this story is not only about hockey, but it is also about small town life, marriage, family, friendship, and courage.There‚Äôs no doubt Backman is a wonderful storyteller and there were many passages that gave me pause, but ultimately I didn‚Äôt love it as much as many others. I don‚Äôt enjoy books about teen culture, sports, or sports culture, and I struggled to finish it. I was disgusted with the whole ‚Äòsports culture‚Äô environment when my own kids were in school and I certainly don‚Äôt want to read about it now. I had read that you don‚Äôt have to like hockey to enjoy the book. In the strictest sense, it‚Äôs true you don‚Äôt have to like hockey, but I would recommend this book only for people who enjoy themes involving teen and sports culture. Or maybe it just hit all my hot buttons, and you will love it. Just be forewarned.** Thanks to Netgalley and Atria Books for providing me with a copy of the book for review"

Fredrik Backman is remarkable. He had me asking myself so many questions and one was how did he get so brilliant with all that wisdom. Excellent choice for a Traveling Sister Read with Norma and Linda. I loved the discussions this one created for us.I don't pick favourites often but this is definitely a favourite and I will be thinking of for a long time.
100,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49444196-katie-b,Rating 5 out of 5,"It's always tricky when you finally sit down with a book that is beloved by so many readers. Your expectations are high and it's like you are on this heightened alert to point out each and every flaw with the writing. Thankfully, the author really managed to deliver and I wouldn't change a darn thing.In the small community of Beartown there isn't a whole lot going on except hockey. Everyone has placed their hopes and dreams on the junior level hockey team. You see, if the team wins the championship it makes the whole town a bunch of winners too. Talk about pressure. A violent act right before the big game rocks the community to the core.The story alternates between many characters in the town but I found it easy to keep track of who was who. I love that the author took this approach in telling the story because you truly got a sense of this community and what makes it frustrating, maddening, horrifying, and a whole lot of other things is knowing you could substitute your town for Beartown. It might be a fictional story, but it certainly was not an unrealistic scenario.A tough read given the subject matter but the author somehow managed to sneak in some beautiful moments as well. With this book being the second one I have read by this author, I think he really understands human nature. The good, bad, ugly, everything. I will definitely pick up the sequel to this book very soon. "
101,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte,Rating 5 out of 5,"I'm not reviewing the book, neither writing a blurb for it. I'm expressing my experience of this deeply humane saga.I've read all Frederik Backman's book and was looking forward to this latest offering. As usual it was packed with emotions, strong characters and passion. This time around it was a small town with a passion for ice hockey and a community who desperately needed to win the season in the interest of the future. Beartown did not have tourism, high-tech or mine industries; it only had darkness, cold and unemployment. It was a town where wild animals barely endure but where the people were tough enough to overcome the challenges. The high school's ice hockey team was their only claim to possible fame and future fortunes. Nobody lived in that town, everybody just survived it. The rules by which the community was built determined that all inhabitants must play by the rules, work hard, take the knocks, don't complain, keep your mouth shut. And so it was for generations.It was the end of the season with the semi-finals looming. Emotions ran high, winning was everything, the social dynamics sped out of control and the ice hockey club's motto, ""Culture, Values, Community"", shuddered against the walls of the club offices and ice rink. The players understood their trainers. If you apply enough pressure to coal, it becomes diamonds. The club had an unpleasant culture of silence, the sort of thing you find among soldiers and criminals.... Silence always goes hand in hand with shame. But then: the unthinkable happened and the silence was broken, defied, challenged, by an event that rocked the town. A whole community had to test and re-evaluate their own mores and values as well as the noble intentions they had for their children. Nobody could escape the test of loyalty... Some quotes from the book:Water expands when it freezes; you need to know that if you build a house in Beartown. In the summer the rain seeps into the cracks in the bricks, then when the temperature slips below zero the moisture freezes to ice, and the bricks break. She will remember that that‚Äôs how it felt to grow up as the little sister of a dead big brother. A childhood that was one long, desperate attempt not to be liquid, not to seek out the cracks in your parents.Water: If you let it make its way too far in, it can freeze into ice and break your heart.There are few words that are harder to explain than ‚Äúloyalty.‚Äù It‚Äôs always regarded as a positive characteristic, because a lot of people would say that many of the best things people do for each other occur precisely because of loyalty. The only problem is that many of the very worst things we do to each other occur because of the same thing.‚ÄúNever trust people who don‚Äôt have something in their lives that they love beyond all reason.‚Äù Her mom loves a man who loves a place that loves a game. This is a hockey town, and there are plenty of things you can say about those, but at least they‚Äôre predictable. You know what to expect if you live here. Day after day after day.Beartown by Backman differs hugely from his previous books in that it moved away from the Swedish idiom and adapted a North American 'feel'. The Swedish authenticity is absent. I can only assume that the prose was adapted, stream-lined, for a much bigger American audience, with a touch of popular drama, action and excitement brought in to cater for this particular audience. The editors changed.However, Beartown is an excellent story written by a skillful author. The town is still Swedish. The setting still the dark wonderland of the Swedish winter. A really thought-provoking, heart-stopping tale. A Man Called Ove was, and still is, by far my favorite Backman book. In fact, it is still one of my all-time favorite reads. It was written for a different audience with different characters to serve the tale and presented an honesty which made it a superb and highly popular read. The 'earthliness' and charm in A Man Called Ove, and My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry and Britt-Marie Was Here have gone. The dry and subtle humor left with it. In its place a political correctness moved in with a politeness that will be more acceptable and soothing to a different audience. The previous books were character driven. This book is action-driven. The Beartown characters were interesting, strong, passionate about life, family, community and self interests. They were honest, dishonest and multi-faceted. Some were heartwarming and other heartbreaking. It ripped my heart out.Be that as it may, I loved Beartown too. Not in love with it. Just loved it. However, it still gets another well-deserved five-star rating. Thankfully Frederik Backman was still present. A fantastic read. RECOMMENDED for sure!"
102,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,Rating 4 out of 5,"A morality tale that exposes the dark side of school team sport programs, with hockey as exemplar. Backman works his usual magic of pulling the reader‚Äôs heartstrings while delivering wisdom on meeting life‚Äôs challenges from seemingly unlikely sources. This is certainly a moving and dramatic story, and one that finds heroism and humanity even in characters you would most like to hate. However, I personally got worn down by the relentless repetition of its simple theme, namely that the cult-like drive toward team winning inspires individual achievement and community cohesion but at the cost of the souls of the players and the town itself. As the book cover indicates, there is a violent event in this tale that splits Beartown apart. Not wanting to spoil that core plot element makes it hard to go into details of the book‚Äôs successes and weaknesses. I can say that I felt there were too many characters to focus on and that I missed the humor that palliated the tragedy in his other books.The remote father of a teenaged hockey star, Kevin, conveys an ominous life-lesson about the impending championship meet:‚Ä¶the final isn‚Äôt just about hockey. It‚Äôs about what sort of man you want to be. A man who goes out and grabs what he deserves, or one who stands in the corner waiting for someone to give it to him.The talented coach, David, wisely stresses teamwork in his training philosophy:He taught them that passes are just as important as shots. ‚Ä¶But he also taught them that they only had each other, that the only person you can trust in this world is the guy next to you on the ice.But he can‚Äôt really take credit for creating a player like Kevin:Because what makes Kevin the best is his absolute desire to win. Not that he hates losing, but that he can‚Äôt even begin to conceive of trying to accept not winning. He‚Äôs merciless. You can‚Äôt teach someone that.Some core messages:When you lose hockey it feels like having your heart scalded. When you win, you own the clouds.Difficult questions, simple answers. What is a community?It is the sum total of our choices.There are few words that are harder to explain than ‚Äúloyalty.‚Äù It‚Äôs always regarded as a positive characteristic, because a lot of people would say that many of the best things people do for each other occur precisely because of loyalty. The only problem is that many of the very worst things we can do to each other occur because of the same thing.We can‚Äôt protect our children we can‚Äôt protect our children we can‚Äôt protect our children. Personally, this was more like a 3.5 star read for me. I had already got most of the book‚Äôs messages from another book about hockey achievement as both a doorway to and displacement from life for an Ojibway youth in Ontario, Wagamese‚Äôs powerful Indian Horse.This book was provided for review by publisher through the Netgalley program."

Both my brothers played from a very young age. I didn't want to read this book. Prior to today, my standard book recommendation has been  A Constellation of Vital Phenomena, a brilliant book that is the best I've read in the past several years. Over the past week I keep hearing myself recommend Beartown because it warrants the recommendation, as well as a spot in my favorites list. It's that good. With its broad fan base and many reviews, I can't add much to the conversation so I will simply say that this surprised me. I wasn't a fan of the structure in the beginning but I was immediately drawn to the characters and the story. As the story evolved, I forgot about the structure until I realized how deliberate it was. It's amazing how much can be relayed in such short, stilted sentences.Beside the puck lies a watch.5 stars. A favorite."
104,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36348070-brandice,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow, Beartown was SO good! Backman has done it again. The setting is a small town (Beartown),located in a cold forest, competing with jobs, sports teams, greater opportunities, and the residents of other nearby, bigger and more prosperous towns. Beartown focuses on its love of hockey. Boys become men when they play on Beartown‚Äôs hockey teams. The story opens with one event then backtracks to how the town arrived at said event. Beartown is a story about friendships, family, community, the power of sports (for better or worse), right vs. wrong, and good vs. evil. The book had me hooked early on. The story built at a good pace - it wasn‚Äôt a slow build but also didn‚Äôt move at the typical quick pace of a thriller. I definitely wouldn‚Äôt classify Beartown as a thriller, but it was intense. Some plot elements were obvious and predictable but not all of them. The story kept me curious about how things would unfold. I liked the ending too. When the book came out earlier this year, I remember reading several reviews where readers mentioned they didn‚Äôt like hockey or weren‚Äôt fans and still enjoyed the book. I do like hockey and I enjoyed the many references to the intensity required for the game, the sounds on the ice during practice and in games, the dedication and commitment players must bring, etc., however, I don‚Äôt think this is all exclusive to hockey - it‚Äôs applicable to most sports, and I think these elements were well-balanced in the story. There‚Äôs so much more to the story that it was easy for me to see why non-hockey fans would still rave about this wonderful book. Beartown is easily one of my favorite reads of the year and for anyone late to the game like me, I highly recommend it!"

Still an absolute favorite!...wowI'm just staring into my screen not know what to say at this point. I guess all I can say is that this is my 6th Backman book, and it might be favorite... (A Man Called Ove does fight back to keep the position) To describe this book in one word... Powerful! You know when you read something, and it just hits you? Like these select words, put together by a person you've never met and haven't spoken to, feel like they're meant for you. That's what this book feels like, like it was meant for me to read it. Speaking as a person who has read quite a number of books, and loves them all very much...This book stands slightly away from those, in its own little spot in my heart! (If you haven't read a Fredrik Backman book yet... that simply needs to change!)"

I can't wait to discuss this with my book club!""No one ever said life was going to be easy."" Being a parent makes you feel like a blanket that's always too small.

109,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt,Rating 4 out of 5,"Fredrik Backman has made quite a name for himself with a number of his novels, though I chose to watch their success from the sidelines. When this book was recommended to me, I thought I would give it a try, since my favourite sport plays a central role. Beartown defines itself by the success of the local hockey team. Buried in the forested part of Sweden, Beartown is usually the butt end of jokes around the country, though some still remember when its junior team rose to second best in a national tournament. Now, two decades on, the team finds itself in the semi-finals, hoping to beat the odds and vie for the coveted championship. While the town waits for game day, the reader learns more about the locals and how hockey influences their daily choices. From teenage girls looking to become more popular to a general manager whose past glories are all but shelved as he makes the tough calls, through to the players themselves who seek fame and fortune. That buzz all changes when one of the star players is accused of a serious criminal act. Backman explores how hockey runs so deep through the veins of some locals that choosing to knock someone down a peg is a greater crime than anything a player could have done. Faced with this division, Beartown must come to grips with all that takes place during the fallout and choose who ought to be vilified, and which lives deserve protection. An insightful book that explores how a small town deals with its one uniting force, even when it becomes tarnished. Recommended for all who love character exploration and the examination of society through small-town microcosms.While I am no hockey player, I can see how many can relate to this book. The story is one that transcends Backman‚Äôs native Sweden and could easily be supplanted here to small-town Canada. Any community that relies on a single sport to create its fabric is sure to see the parallels, as well as how its stars are more than people, perhaps even time-limited gods. Backman offers up a slew of interesting characters who bring their own perspectives to the hockey persona that pervades Beartown. It is not worth trying to list them all, but the attentive reader will see so many personalities woven into the larger fabric of the town and how each plays an important role. Backman does deify the hockey players, but there is a reason for this, as he explores the role they play with the everyday citizen. Many may shy away from the novel because of their lack of interest in hockey, but I would warn those folks not to do so. The story transcends the puck in the net mentality that seems so strong with those who love hockey like myself. Backman offers up a wonderfully powerful social commentary on sports, small towns, and the blinders people put on when things go wrong. I can see a large cross-section of the population enjoying this book because of that, even as the town‚Äôs fabric is frayed and torn apart because of a certain action. There is so much going on within the pages of this novel, though much is spoiled if I say any more. An eventful story, Backman forces the reader to think outside the rink and see just how loyal small towns can be to those who create unifying moments that create water cooler fodder. Bring on the sequel!Kudos, Mr. Backman, for an interesting exploration of society. I am eager to see if you continue in your sequel, which I have in hand and will begin now!Love/hate the review?

'what an uncomfortable, terrible source of shame it is for the world that the victim is so often the one left with the most empathy for others.‚Äô

this book is my baby, these characters are my children, and this will be buried with me. beartown is a small town that brings hope to a small community, the courage it takes for an individual to go against expectations. and holds the secrets that may separate them.it's about love and loss, loyalty and betrayal, resistance and courage. it's about parenthood, classism, child loss, grief, toxic masculinity, rape and sexual assault, abuse and suicide, sexism, homophobia, and so much more. while everyone has their own story, this book mostly revolves around the rape of a girl- maya, and the consequences of the people's actions and lack thereof. the writing, the pacing, the plot, the characters and their stories. you would think that this would be messy with all the topics talked about in such a regular sized book but no, it was paced so well. the way every topic was seeped into the characters so flawlessly was mwah, perfection.every single character was written so incredibly. he gradually introduced each character and unfolded their stories without slowing down the general plot.hockey was the heart of beartown and its people. it shows that while everyone has their own secrets and battles, hockey will either be something that brings them all together or keep them apart. onto the characters ‚§µÔ∏èamat - my baby ‚ú¶ he's so kind, loving, and selfless. he tried so hard to do right by everyone, especially his mother. him getting maya a guitar? absolutely everything. helping his mother by cleaning so much so that she wouldn't have to clean as much? my heartüíî 
'all the good you do today will be forgotten by others tomorrow. do good anyway.''they say i'm too little to play. become good player anyway'
fatima - my favorite kind-hearted person ‚ú¶ the wisdom she offered amat every step of the way. his selflessness comes entirely from her, i loved their little family so much, they deserve the most.benji - the boy with sad eyes and a wild heart‚ú¶ the love he deserves for all he has and hasn't done is eternal. his character was written so well. i didn't think i would love him as much i do now when he was first introduced- because of the way he acted and who he was with- but when his story started to unfold and we saw glimpses of who he actually is as a person; he immediately became my favorite besides amat. loved that he was kind to maya after what occurred and hate how out of place he felt with the homophobic ""jokes"" said by his teammates his friends. i love his family so much, you can tell he was raised by women. it was so sad how he always found ways to hurt himself just so he can't feel the pain on the inside. 
'he's never cut his own skin, but he understands those who do.'
maya - and her guitar‚ú¶ she's so brave and kind. loved how her character evolved throughout the story and how she learns there is more to the world than just the confinements of the small world she created for herself. 
‚Äôshe's not thinking like someone who's been the victim of a crime, she's thinking like someone who's committed one: all she can think is that no one must ever know, that she must get rid of all the evidence.‚Äô
ana - and nature‚ú¶ her character changed so much and in the best way possible. i thought she was going to be naive and insufferable but she's so much more than that. the circumstances are obviously not the best but i did love seeing how her character developed and loved getting glimpses of her life as well. i did hate how her assault never got talked about, and even though i knew she wouldn't tell maya (since she was dealing with her own) i wish she would have atleast told someone üíî
'sometimes, when she felt really bad, she counted scars. but mostly she just counted faults. she would stand in front of the mirror and point at them: all the things that were wrong about her. sometimes that made it feel more bearable, when she had already said them out loud to herself before anyone at school did.'
peter & kira - the general manager and the lawyer.‚ú¶ the love i have for them is incomprehensible. the way they are their own people, the way they carry themselves and the way they love each other and their kids. the way they spoke about parenthood and the sacrifices that come with it. the way they spoke on child loss, how the mourning never stops. the little glimpses we got of how they kept the memory of isak alive. most of all, i love how they never blamed each other and loved each other throughout it all. so sad and so wholesome, they deserve the best ever. 
'kira never stopped making his pulse throb in his throat; he still loves her the way you do when you're a teenager, when your heart swells in your chest and makes you feel like you can't breathe.'
ramona - the crazy old bag‚ú¶ the only character that spoke up for every little thing. she let nothing slide, a queen. loved her as soon as she was introduced. the way she stood up for maya without a moment of hesitation, the way she slapped men for being dumb as fuck, and the way she ate them all up at that meeting üë∏ it was so sad how she spoke about her late husband. her pov in chapter 18 and the what she said to sune were everything.
‚Äúany living thing that is kept behind bars for long enough eventually becomes more scared of the unknown than its own captivity. at the start she only stayed indoors because she could still hear his laughter in here, his voice, and the way he used to swear when he stubbed his toe on the low step behind the bar. but isolating yourself happens faster than you might think: the days blur together when you live more on the inside than outside, and the years continued to pass by on the other side of the street while she desperately tried to make everything inside the bearskin and the apartment above it carry on exactly as it was when he died. she was frightened she would forget him if she went out into the world, that she might go to the supermarket and come home to find that his laughter was no longer there. then suddenly one morning, eleven years had passed and everyone but her boys thinks she‚Äôs lost her mind now. she became a time traveller trapped inside her own machine.‚Äù
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äîbobo's character growth was absolutely everything. he actually surprised me and i'm so proud of the person he became ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©πmaggan you maggot, i wanna kill u and bury you with that maggot ass son of urs tooüñïi don't think i have ever hated two irrelevant dumb characters as much as i hate these two. i hated how it took for a boy to say it for them to believe her, but i did love it because it made it so realistic and this book thrived on realism. everything was written from the heart, every character was thoroughly and perfectly developed.if you have not read this, or even heard of it, i urge you to please read it! it talks about so much in the most beautiful way possible. i love this book with my entire heart and would not change a thing. all 477 pages were absolutely worth it and would read 1000 more pages of it within a heartbeat. i have no doubts the other two books will eat as much as this if not more. .¬∑:*¬®‡º∫ ‡ºª¬®*:¬∑.‚û∏ 'She knows that one of the funny things about fighting for success is that you never really stop fighting.

No matter how hard you try to cover everyone, there's always someone who's freezing.'‚û∏ 'Hate can be a deeply stimulating emotion. The world becomes much easier to understand and much less terrifying if you divide everything and everyone into friends and enemies, we and they, good and evil. The easiest way to unite a group isn‚Äôt through love, because love is hard. It makes demands. Hate is simple.'‚û∏ 'At night Kira still goes around the house, counting their children. One, two, three. Two in their beds. One in heaven.'‚û∏ 'What is a home? It's a place that belongs to you. So can it still be your home if you're no longer welcome there?‚û∏ How big is the world when you're twelve years old? Both infinte and infinitesimal. It's all your wildest dreams.'‚û∏ 'what you create, others destroy. create anyway. because in the end, it is between you and God. it was never between you and anyone else anyway.'‚û∏ ""why did I just go around being happy? if only i'd known what was going to happen, could i have stopped it?""‚û∏ 'bitterness can be corrosive; it can rewrite your memories as if it were scrubbing a crime scene clean, until in the end you only remember what suits you of its causes.'‚û∏ 'She already knew that the world is a cruel place if you're a girl. Her parents couldn't imagine that this could happen, but Maya simply hadn't expected it to happen to her.''People sometimes say that sorrow is mental but longing is physical. One is a wound, the other an amputated limb, a withered petal compared to a snapped stem. Anything that grows closely enough to what it loves will eventually share the same roots. We can talk about loss, we can treat it and give it time, but biology still forces us to live according to certain rules: plants that are split down the middle don‚Äôt heal, they die.'.¬∑:*¬®‡º∫ ‡ºª¬®*:¬∑.

111,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani,Rating 4 out of 5,"Bj√∂rnstad = Beartown (Beartown, #1), Fredrik BackmanFredrik Backman (born 2 June 1981) is a Swedish author, blogger, and columnist. He wrote A Man Called Ove (2012), Things My Son Needs to Know about the World (2012), My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry (2013), Britt-Marie Was Here (2014), Beartown (2017), Us Against You (2018), and Anxious People (2020).The story of Beartown follows the events leading up to the rape of 15-year-old girl Maya Andersson by the star junior hockey player Kevin Erdahl, and the consequences for Maya and Kevin, the players, their families, friends, and the community which has a long-standing reputation as a hockey town.Peter Andersson, in his forties, is the general manager of the ice hockey club in Beartown, a small town located somewhere in Sweden. Peter grew up in Beartown and was a junior hockey star. He went to North America to play in the NHL, but injuries stopped his career short. He married Kira, a lawyer from a big city, and their first-born son, Isak, died when he was just a baby. Peter and Kira decided to return to Beartown, with their other children, Maya and Leo, when Peter was offered the job with the ice hockey club. Kira continued to work as a lawyer in a nearby city. Maya and her best friend, Ana, have different interests, but are devoted to each other. Because Ana lives with her father and her mother has left, Ana spends a lot of time with the Andersson family.Amat is a 15-year-old who immigrated to Sweden when he was a little boy, with his mother, Fatima. Fatima struggles on the edge of poverty and works as custodian at the arena run by the Beartown ice hockey club. She supports Amat's devotion to ice hockey, and he displays remarkable ice skating speed. He often goes to the rink with Fatima before it opens and practices his skating techniques and ability. This catches the attention of Sune, the veteran coach of the A-team, which is the highest level team operated by the Beartown club.Kevin Erdahl is the star of the Beartown junior team, which consists of players who are 17 years old. Kevin's talent is so outstanding that the entire junior team has been built around him since he was about seven years old. David is the current coach of the junior team, who has moved up to coach the players in each successive age group as Kevin and his cohort have come through. David, Sune, Peter, the president and directors and sponsors of the ice hockey club, all expect Kevin's team to succeed.The novel opens with the team and the community preparing for a key semi-final game. Recognizing that lack of speed is a weakness, Sune and David agree to add Amat to the team as an underage junior to improve their chances. Beartown wins the semi-final, at least partly because the opposing team was not prepared to defend Amat's speed. ...ÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜŸáÿß€å ⁄ÜÿßŸæ ÿ¥ÿØŸá ÿØÿ± ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ: ¬´ÿ®€åÿ±ÿ™ÿßŸàŸÜ¬ªÿõ ¬´ÿ®€åÿ±ÿ™ÿßŸàŸÜ: ÿ¥Ÿáÿ± ÿÆÿ±ÿ≥€å¬ªÿõ ¬´ÿ¥Ÿáÿ± ÿÆÿ±ÿ≥¬ªÿõ ¬´ÿ¥Ÿáÿ± ÿÆÿ±ÿ≥Ÿáÿß¬ªÿõ ŸÜŸà€åÿ≥ŸÜÿØŸá: ŸÅÿ±ÿØÿ±€å⁄© ÿ®⁄©ŸÖŸÜÿõ ÿ™ÿßÿ±€åÿÆ ŸÜÿÆÿ≥ÿ™€åŸÜ ÿÆŸàÿßŸÜÿ¥ ÿ±Ÿàÿ≤ ŸæÿßŸÜÿ≤ÿØŸáŸÖ ŸÖÿßŸá ÿ≥Ÿæÿ™ÿßŸÖÿ®ÿ± ÿ≥ÿßŸÑ 2018ŸÖ€åŸÑÿßÿØ€åÿπŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ: ÿ®€åÿ±ÿ™ÿßŸàŸÜÿõ ŸÜŸà€åÿ≥ŸÜÿØŸá: ŸÅÿ±ÿØÿ±€å⁄© ÿ®⁄©ŸÖŸÜÿõ ŸÖÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖ ŸÖ€åÿ™ÿ±ÿßÿ≥ÿßÿØÿßÿ™ ÿØÿßŸÜÿ¥Ÿàÿ±ÿõ ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜÿå ŸÖ€åŸÑ⁄©ÿßŸÜÿå 1396ÿõ ÿØÿ± 440ÿµÿõ ÿ¥ÿßÿ®⁄©9786008812036ÿõ ŸÖŸàÿ∂Ÿàÿπ ÿØÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜŸáÿß€å ŸÜŸà€åÿ≥ŸÜÿØ⁄ØÿßŸÜ ÿ≥Ÿàÿ¶ÿØ -

112,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74034800-lucy,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5****There are few words that are harder to explain than 'loyalty'. It's always regarded as a positive characteristic, because a lot of people would say that many of the best things people do for each other occur precisely because of loyalty. The only problem is that many of the worst things we do to each other occur because of the same thing.This was an intense and taut fiction book. The book is set in Beartown. A town that is shrinking with each year, with less jobs and people moving away. Its isolated and very community driven. Despite the gloominess of Beartown, a bright new future is possible with the towns intense investment into the sport of hockey and their local team. The people of Beartown are obsessed with the sport and invest all their time and sometimes their money into training their children in hockey, watching the games and supporting the team. One day, this is all put in jeopardy due to one single horrendous act. This divides the town into those who believe it should be hushed up and those who believe justice should be sought.The topic of this book, the repercussions of the horrendous act and how the people of Beartown react was heart-wrenching, gut-wrenching, infuriating and tearful. At times the people of Beartown would just victim blame and hush up the person who was courageous enough to come forward and take a stand- I would get so angry that I wanted to throw the book across the room. Some moments in the book and the attitudes of the characters made me feel physically sick. The events in this book make you feel like you've been punched in the stomach and all the air is sucked out of you. These emotions that were invoked in me are what makes a good book and makes Fredrik Backman a brilliant writer.Fredrik Backman tells this story from various points of view, all interwoven together to create an intriguing narrative. I especially loved the characters of Amat, who showed courage in a town that wanted to keep him silent; Zach, a bullied boy with his own courageous and empathetic streak; Benji, a hockey player harbouring his own secret; Ana and Maya, two friends with such a close bond that they will always be there for each other; and Kira and Fatima, two mothers who work hard, who don't fit into Beartown's norm, and encourage their children to do what is right, not what is easy. The strength that these last two characters show is truly amazing, Fredrik Backman does a brilliant job at describing a strong bond of love and support between a mother and her children.  What is clear from the narratives of the characters is that hockey is important, and this overshadows and silences any other important factors or important conversation, such as victims of horrendous acts, bullying, sexism, homophobia and racism. It shows how a town would rather silence these 'mishaps' instead of trying to change the society they live in and face the truth.There's a label she used to love but which she loathes when it's pronounced in a Beartown accent: 'career woman'... but no one calls Peter a 'career man.' It strikes a nerve because Kira recognises the insinuation: you have a 'job' so you can provide for the family, whereas a 'career' is selfish.This book delves into victim blaming. The way the town treats the victim is infuriating however it reminds readers that this happens ALL THE TIME to women, and men, everywhere.'I'm just doing my job here.' That's why no one asks what the boy did; as soon as the girl starts to talk they interrupt her with instead with questions about what she did.... If only she hadn't existed, then none of this would have happened, why didn't she think of that?It starts with 'she wanted it' and ends with 'she deserved it'.The reason why I gave this book 4.5* is that for the first 100+ pages there was a keen focus on hockey, which I understand plays a part in showing the reader how important the sport is to the town, however I was losing interest quickly and was not sure if I should continue. In addition, there is a great amount of detail in this book, some which I felt was not needed, and I did not feel that the book needed to be as long as it was."
113,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5009669-tina,Rating 5 out of 5,"Thank-you, Thank-you, Thank-you to NetGalley and Atria books for allowing me the opportunity to read this advanced reader's edition.First off, (as a Canadian) I love hockey. So the blurb about the book intrigued me. A small depressed town, in the forest of Sweden, ever so devoted to their Junior hockey team could so easily have been a small town anywhere in Canada. Everything was riding on the Junior team making the Championship Finals and winning. There was no other option for them. By winning the finals the town would gain notoriety around the country and it would bring a brand new ice hockey training centre and help the depressed economy and its people. Everyone lives and breaths hockey in Beartown until something goes horribly wrong. The story is so much more than just about hockey. It centres around some of the players, coaches and staff and their families.This is such an intense and heartfelt story. It's about a town and people struggling with morals and finding justice. I felt many emotions reading this book from anger to tears of sadness. I highly recommend this book!"
114,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,Rating 2 out of 5,"I appreciated that this book addressed the issue of sexual assault with some sensitivity. I also liked how Fredrik Backman captured the role of place, how one‚Äôs environment ‚Äì in this place, a small town ‚Äì can influence how one wants to live their life and one‚Äôs comfort with speaking up against the norm.That said, I found the writing in Beartown pretty clunky and difficult to connect with. I will provide a few examples. First, Backman often started chapters with vague, ominous introductory statements that felt over-dramatic to me, like this one:‚ÄúA simple truth, repeated as often as it is ignored, is that if you tell a child it can do absolutely anything, or that it can‚Äôt do anything at all, you will in all likelihood be proven right.‚ÄùWhich‚Ä¶ I guess? But it just feels so nonspecific and theatrical that I couldn‚Äôt connect. Another example, this passage after two friends support one another: ‚ÄúNever again do you find friends like the ones you have when you‚Äôre fifteen years old.‚ÄùLike‚Ä¶ I also guess this may be true in some ways? I‚Äôd rather Backman solely show that instead of then telling us the point he‚Äôs trying to get across, which reduces the poignancy of the characters‚Äô interactions with one another.I also feel like the book tried to include too many perspectives. I would have preferred the novel to focus on one to three perspectives instead of including so many and in my opinion, not doing any of them justice. Though vastly different in content and themes, this book reminded me of watching the TV show Euphoria (which I could only get through half of the first season because of all the violence, then I read all the episodes‚Äô Wikipedia summaries lol) ‚Äì there‚Äôs a lot of shifting around to different points of view. Which kind of works in a television show like Euphoria where you can add elements of glitz and glam to the visuals and the narration, not so much in a novel where at least I wanted more depth from the characters. This one is a pass for me."

116,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5220553-allen-walker,Rating 5 out of 5,"""You can't protect your children you can't protect your children you can't protect your children...""One of my favorite books of the year and absolutely the best book I've ever read that I simultaneously despised with every fiber of my being. I'm from a medium-sized town in the South and thus, so so much of this feels familiar. I'm so very lucky that our town sucks at sports because if it didn't, I can't imagine how exactly the same PC would be to Beartown. At one point, I stopped listening to the audio (which is wonderful, btw) and just devoured the back half of the book in a single sitting. This is my first Backman book and, imo, he absolutely DOMINATES the 'small town life' space. Everything about this horrible town feels real. Everyone feels real, all their decisions feel real, the choices they make are garbage, yet the exact garbage, compromising choices that most people make every day. A book that highlights the evil side of community, the evil side of loyalty, the evil side of the desire to be better than you are, the evil side of seeing something but saying nothing. It's a heartwrenching story of small town small-mindedness and how just standing up for what is right can seem an act of the utmost heroism. It's a story where there is no justice, the bad guys don't completely lose, and everyone is left bruised and hurting. It absolutely could happen in my town--just change Beartown Hockey Club to Florida State Football and the details could be identical if something like that happened. Aahhhhhhhhh. At any rate. It's not a book I'll forget any time soon, but it's also one I'll never re-read. "

If this is Backman's usual writing style, then this may be the first and last of his books that I read. I know I'm in the minority on this one, and perhaps it is because I am too cynical - I felt increasingly manipulated as I reached the end.Beartown is the small everytown, where hockey is king. From the very start, it's laid out explicitly that the success of the junior boys' hockey team is paramount: the town's future depends on it. If the hockey team succeeds, there will be a new school coming to town, and with it new families to supplement the dwindling population. Beartown might even get a shopping mall! All of that rests on the shoulders of the teenage boys on the team, and on no one more heavily than the star, Kevin Erdahl. The story transitions between several perspectives. There's Peter Andersson, the general manager of the club, his wife Kira, and daughter Maya. There are several coaches with different styles who have molded generations of boys and men in Beartown. There are classmates, friends, and teammates of Kevin and Maya. It's a book that truly shows the town in full, and the impact of the choices that the characters make ripple through the entire population. I really liked the setting and the central story of the hockey team. Backman takes a lot of care describing local institutions and areas (the rink, the local bar, the different neighborhoods in the town), as well as the Swedish winter (the darkness, the cold, the atmosphere). I also liked reading the different perspectives, particularly Sune, the older coach in decline, and Amat, the younger player desperate to prove himself. The first half was immersive and interesting. But as I read on, the book lost me. It was partially due to writing style, and partially due to the resolution of the major themes in the story, which I found trite and unsatisfying. There's this third-person narrator who keeps showing up, to say things like this:
Hockey is never satisfied being part of your life, it wants to be all of it.
and
We devote ourselves to sports because they remind us of how small we are just as much as they make us bigger.
and
When you can accept the worst aspects of your teammates because you love the collective, that‚Äôs when you‚Äôre a team player.
and on, and on. This is the same style that wraps up the central conflict of the book, which is Kevin Erdahl, the teenage star, sexually assaulting Maya, the daughter of the hockey club's general manager. While the question is, for the town, ""what's the right thing to do, in this conflict?"", the question for Backman is, ""what's the aphorism to apply to this contrived situation?"" How can Backman get his characters to act the aphorisms out, in a somewhat cartoonish way? And how can he misrepresent the actual events happening on the page to manipulate the reader's emotions? (There are several examples of this. (1) The entire book - the ENTIRE BOOK - is based on the setup that one teenager is in the woods with a gun to another teen's head. We get back to that at the very end. Turns out, Maya didn't load the gun and never intended to. She just wanted to scare the shit out of Kevin. In what world does this happen???? (2) The writing in the scene where Zacharias enters the school to scrub the words off of Maya's locker deliberately sets you up to think he has killed himself. (3) When David realizes that Benji is gay, he's massively disappointed and upset for a few pages .... and then you learn he's upset AT HIMSELF! The way that all three of these are written is deliberately misleading to the reader and doesn't mirror the experience that the character is having (and you're reading their perspective!). It's only written that way to manipulate your emotional response.) How are we supposed to feel about the supposed moral quandary of the book, when it actually turns out to be quite easy for everyone to do the right thing? (For real - the older female bartender is able to rally the young ne'er-do-wells of the town to her side, the younger witness in love with the victim easily gives up his spot on the team to Do the Right Thing, and the perpetrator's MOTHER has an emotional breakdown out of the horror of the event.) These scenes aren't actual exploration of the ethical implications. They're just setup so that Backman can emotionally manipulate the reader through stock characters and then toss an aphorism on top.So, not a fan, and I still need someone to explain the exchange rate for kronor to me."

So, I was reading two Backman book's in parallel and the writing style is sooo different in both, I did not even feel they have been written by the same person. And that itself my friends, is an awesome feat in my eyes!!Reading Beartown is like sitting for a meal and expecting something simple but instead getting served a gourmet meal! There are layers and layers in this story, elaborately prepared and each revealing a different flavor to the story.The writing is beautiful and the author does a very clever thing where a particular sentence is used in multiple places in the story and each time the meaning may differ based on it's placement. At the start we are introduced to more than 15 characters and all at a surface level. But then as the story progressed it was like each film is peeled and a new facet is revealed for someone you had all figured out. I will not be naming any particular character in my review (even though I have 3 personal favorites), as each character is equally important to the story even if you hate them.The main emotion I felt throughout this book was ANGER. I seriously think that this book gave me high blood pressure (at least temporarily). I really did not know how this is going to end and felt like getting into the pages and throttling certain characters .Well, this book gave me sweet closure which was unexpected. The last few pages and the way everything was handled was spectacular. I did not even guess at the start that the ending can make me feel the way it did.I read somewhere that 
'Book's don't change people, paragraphs and sentences do'
 and this author's writing is powerful enough to make me actually believe it now.As you can see I haven't actually written about the actual story in my review because the best way to read this book is on a clean slate and experience each emotion- anger, frustration, sadness, elation as you go through this wonderful experience.I will be on the lookout for any future work from Mr. Fredrik Backman as I am an ardent fan."

  ‚ÄúIf you are honest, people may deceive you. Be honest anyway.If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfishness. Be kind anyway.All the good you do today will be forgotten by others tomorrow. Do good anyway.‚Äù ‚ÄúAll adults have days when we feel completely drained. When we no longer know quite what we spend so much time fighting for, when reality and everyday worries overwhelm us and we wonder how much longer we‚Äôre going to be able to carry on. The wonderful thing is that we can all live through far more days like that without breaking than we think. The terrible thing is that we never know exactly how many.‚Äù‚ÄúPeople say she‚Äôs gone mad, because that‚Äôs what people who know nothing about loneliness call it.‚Äù‚ÄúFor the perpetrator, rape lasts just a matter of minutes. For the victim, it never stops.‚Äù‚ÄúHumanity has many shortcomings, but none is stronger than pride.‚Äù‚ÄúEveryone has a thousand wishes before a tragedy, but just one afterward.‚Äù‚ÄúWhat an uncomfortable, terrible source of shame it is for the world that the victim is so often the one left with the most empathy for others.‚Äù‚ÄúHate can be a deeply stimulating emotion. The world becomes much easier to understand and much less terrifying if you divide everything and everyone into friends and enemies, we and they, good and evil. The easiest way to unite a group isn‚Äôt through love, because love is hard. It makes demands. Hate is simple.‚Äù‚Äúit‚Äôs always easier to lecture other people about morality when you‚Äôve never had to answer for anything yourself.‚Äù‚ÄúSometimes life doesn‚Äôt let you choose your battles.

Then the story changed and I realized that all before had been prelude! Important prelude to all that would now happen in Beartown!Beartown exists for and with hockey. They have long had a symbiotic relationship, sometimes healthy for both parties, sometimes not for one, the other or either. Families, businesses, all that remains in the declining town are in some way linked to the ice, to hockey. In some ways, there are more elements of Backman's characters from prior books present here than I first thought. There are no stock characters; all are individuals with their own tics and warts or complexities. The quirkiness is more internalized here than in Ove or Grandmother or Britt-Marie, but it is still present. But in Beartown, Backman has delivered a novel with a more complex and a more full story...and actually more complex characters, though I continue to love so many of his earlier ones. Here the town is a living breathing entity, almost separate from all of it's human members. It's master is winning hockey games and survival of the town. Each of the individual human beings, be they the high school age players, their classmates or parents or siblings; the business men who control the local economy; the leather-jacketed toughs who seem a force unto themselves; the coaches, managers or opponents, has to struggle within this town to find their place. And the defining moment of this novel affects everyone of them.I recommend this book to all who have enjoyed Backman in the past. And to those who have not found what they were looking for in past books by Fredrick Backman, I would suggest giving Beartown a try. I suspect it will grab you as it did me and not let you go.A copy of this book was provided by the publisher through NetGalley in return for an honest review."

A girl is laughing. A child is crying."" We get it.

Based on the reviews, I did sense I had to expect something quite different. It certainly was ‚Äì while ‚ÄòA Man called Ove‚Äô points to that beyond the literal leaving quite a bit unsaid, ‚ÄòBeartown‚Äô takes on the job of verbalizing what would be most difficult for most and does an exceptional job of it. The aftereffects of the book continue well after I finished it. Beartown is a small town, where everything centres around Ice Hockey. There is not much of industry or choices for a career and it is hockey which fires the imagination of the youth. Peter is the General Manager of the Hockey Club having had a successful career himself and moves back to Beartown from Canada. His wife Kira and children Maya & Leo are supportive of how hockey is centerstage in their lives. Kevin is the star of the junior team and will soon be actively sought outside the community. Sune is the coach of the senior team and it looks like the board will most likely let him go in favour of David who is the far more aggressive coach of the junior team. At this point in the story, Backman‚Äôs narrative meanders to the edges of ageism / devaluing of the wise & experienced but pulls back ‚Äì squarely moving into the aftermath of a sexual assault and the divisions it creates. There are so many issues the story throws open in the later stages ‚Äì power structures in society, egos, trauma, manipulation, corruption, class & gender prejudice, burden of proof, victims viewed as manipulators, unequal voices, mobocracy, self-delusion & most of all oppressive silence bordering on cowardice. After all ‚Äì there is no greater enemy to truth than violence, and there is no greater hope than when values combine with courage.The characters are many but will stay with me for a long time to come: Benji for his friendship & calling a spade a spade when it comes to it, Maya for her grace & strength, Peter & Kira for their maturity & family ties, Amat for his humility & courage, Ramona for her values & plain speak, Sune for his wisdom‚Ä¶..It is just possible that the second paragraph of my review might have portrayed an inaccurate picture of what the book is about. It is not about ‚ÄòBeartown‚Äô, a fictional town ‚Äì it is about the world we live in & us - our choices & behaviours.‚ÄòBeartown‚Äô is one book all must read."

No time like the present. . .My first thought when I picked up this book was ""Can I get through 400 plus pages of a book about hockey?"" I should have known that with Backman doing the writing, it would be about so much more than hockey.And it was. . .Backman's style of writing draws you in and takes you places you did not know you would go. The Beartown hockey team is the backdrop for a huge story. There are some characters we see impacting the story without even knowing their names -- like the man in the Volvo and David's girlfriend. As the plot is moved forward we often see characters referred to as a sum of pronouns rather than by their name. At times the reader must fill in the name using their own deductions -- if the character has been given a name. What I loved about this book is classic Backman coming through in the compassionate way he depicts the people in his books and the way they deal with the events that shape their lives. They make hard decisions and we understand them thanks to Backman. ""People round here don't always know the difference between right and wrong. But we know the difference between good and evil.""Highly recommended!"

Beartown explores the hopes that bring a small community together, the secrets that tear it apart, and the courage it takes for an individual to go against the grain.This is my very first Fredrik Backman novel and lemme just say- I loved it. There is SO much explored in 432 pages. But let me just leave the opening lines right here for you- ""Late one evening towards the end of March, a teenager picked up a double-barreled shotgun, walked into the forest, put the gun to someone else's forehead and pulled the trigger. This is the story of how we got there.""I mean, omg right-The novel takes place in a small town called Beartown in Sweden. The town has definitely seen better days as it is declining more and more. Industry is withering away with many people looking to live elsewhere. What does however keep this town together is their equal admiration and love the ice hockey team. The people of Beartown are most definitely crazy and obsessed over ice hockey and can‚Äôt get enough of it (and can‚Äôt get away from it ha ha ha). Much of that I can relate to coming from Boston Mass where we live for hockey as well.However, this admiration for the hockey team hides the toxic culture of the team and the some of the people in the town. You slowly begin to realize there is a large amount of sexism and toxic masculinity among the people of Beartown.This is further highlighted when the teams most prominent and star player commits an act so heinous that you‚Äôll want to punch him in the throat. This act essentially has a ripple effect on the town causing a major divide in loyalty that will change the lives of everyone forever.
‚ÄúHate can be a deeply stimulating emotion. The world becomes easier to understand and much less terrifying if you divide everything and everyone into friends and enemies, we and they, good and evil. The easiest way to unite a group isn't through love, because love is hard, It makes demands. Hate is simple. So the first thing that happens in a conflict is that we choose a side, because that's easier than trying to hold two thoughts in our heads at the same time. The second thing that happens is that we seek out facts that confirm what we want to believe - comforting facts, ones that permit life to go on as normal. The third is that we dehumanize our enemy.‚Äù
So in terms of the writing and the pace of the story, it starts off pretty slowly. This is something I liked as Backman slowly builds up what the town and its people are like.
‚ÄúThe people of Beartown love the fact that the climate is so inhospitable, because not everyone can handle it: that reminds them of their own strength and resilience.‚Äù
This buildup allows you to understand what type of people the story will be dealing with and helped me understand how each of them thinks. This also allowed you to understand the complex relationship each of the characters in the story have with each other.
‚ÄúThere are few words that are harder to explain than ""loyalty."" It's always regarded as a positive characteristic, because a lot of people would say that many of the best things people do for each other occur precisely because of loyalty. The only problem is that many of the very worst things we do to each other occur because of the same thing.‚Äù‚ÄúBitterness can be corrosive. It can rewrite your memories as if it were scrubbing a crime scene clean, until in the end you only remember what suits you of its causes.‚Äù
This book is complex in the sense that it gave me hope, inspiration, made me feel anger, sadness, disparity. It's all consuming and your feelings are all over the freaking place it's so hard to put it into words. Truly incredibly written, thought provoking and a gritty yet all too realistic novel. 
‚ÄúEveryone has a thousand wishes before a tragedy, but just one afterward.‚Äù

He doesn‚Äôt only capture the culture and subtleties of a small town, but also the wider extent of human nature itself. He just gets people. You don‚Äôt have to know anything about Sweden or hockey to get into this. If you swapped out those two things for somewhere in the southern US and football the book would still work. I think part of what makes this novel so impactful is that it transcends its very specific setting and is instead a more universal story. There‚Äôs really nobody I wouldn‚Äôt recommend Beartown to.

This novel is a departure for him, and I think it's my favorite one yet.Beartown is a book about a town where ice hockey rules people's lives and defines them. But at it's basic level, it is a book about sports. Football, basketball, baseball, soccer, lacrosse, tennis, gymnastics, just pick one and it works just as well as ice hockey to demonstrate what a particular sport means to it's participants. How a sport can make or break kids. How coaches sacrifice family and home life for the team. The sacrifices of time, energy and money for the parents because their kids are passionate about a sport. How being rich or poor or somebody or nobody ceases to matter when you sit in the stands for two or three hours cheering your team on. The beauty of victory and the heartbreak of loss, and how both those things have something to teach. And underneath it all, how we treat each other in the game of life.There are some big issues in this novel not related to sports, but to things that get swept under the rug, secrets that can weigh heavily on people, and everyone's need to be included and accepted. The resolutions were real, not all neat and tidy and tied up with a bow. I loved these characters and this story and this town.One more caveat if you plan to read this one.

Backman is a gifted storyteller, he knows how to convey emotion perfectly. I would even say he is better with emotion than with words (his writing style isn't mindblowing), but I think that the emotion-stirring makes him a such popular writer. He is just a bit melodramatic at times, but that didn't bother me. This book deals with a lot of heavy topics, such as sexual and physical abuse, poverty, addiction, in a very realistic way, that is complex to achieve, not overbearing, and at the same time not shallow. Backman also has a gift of describing simple everydayness - hockey training, going to school, work and family life, engagingly and interestingly. Psychological characterization is done completely through scenes of day-to-day life making this book an embodiment of show, don't tell writers mantra. I was completely immersed in the story and wanted to stay as long as possible in Beartown. Backman does a fascinating job at describing suffering that is inevitable in ordinary life, no matter your age, gender, social class. Through his writing, he describes the difficulties of the bully as well as the bullied, in a well-balanced, empathy-evoking way, without justification or judgment, and you can connect to the story of every single character. That is a quality I always admire in a writer, not to make characters black and white but to take time to show the vulnerable and wounded parts of those who are considered to be villains. It is admirable what a writer approaches issues of gender or social inequality without being blind to the greater picture of all-consuming suffering that is inherent to all humans, no matter the injustice imposed by society. No privilege makes you immune to pain. Great work! "

This book showed he has a wider ranger than I had previously attributed to him.""Bear Town"" is a book that is seemingly about hockey and a small town where that sport reigns supreme. A place where most of the residents see their glory days in high school and differences are mocked, not celebrated. A dying town that pins its hopes on the thought that one day the local team might just win a major championship.The story could simply be read at the surface level, and still be a well-written and engaging tale. However, for me, the book was more a metaphor on a way of life. The danger of small-thinking and mob mentality. The shallowness of just ""going with the flow.""

Culture, Values, Community 
The OLD Beartown motto. The new one ‚Ä¶ well, the town has taken so many hits over the years, there really isn‚Äôt any except ""The team comes first"" and that is exactly the problem.Beartown is at the edge of nowhere, in the middle of woods and darkness and cold. Once, the town had a shot at greatness thanks to their signature sport: ice hockey. But they missed the chance and so fewer and fewer people work in the only factory in town, more and more people move away and those that stay are in a kind of downward spiral.We‚Äôre following many of the residents throughout the book, learn about their pasts to understand their future. Because what we‚Äôre told in the very first sentence of the book is Late one evening toward the end of March, a teenager picked up a double-barrelled shotgun, walked into the forest, put the gun to someone else‚Äôs forehead and pulled the trigger.Who, how exactly or why is what we find out while following the story. We see events unfold and even though I knew relatively early on what was about to happen to a certain teenager, it was gripping and heartbreaking and I couldn‚Äôt put the book down (but had to put it down because it often hurt).Ice hockey, by now, is all the town has left so to some degree I understood the desperation and people‚Äôs obsession with winning as it would have improved the town‚Äôs situation by a lot (a hockey school, a shopping mall, more investors - that sort of thing). However, what the town was willing to do for that was abominable. I get that you want to save your home but at some point you have to ask if what you‚Äôre turning it and yourself into in the process is worth saving. As Stephen King so aptly put it once: ‚ÄûSometimes, dead is better‚Äú.The kids on the team basically know no rules. They can misbehave towards teachers or other people as much as they like, even break the law, and are never punished because the team always comes first and the town needs the team to win (for which they need certain players).But when is enough enough?Nothing that is worth it ever comes easy but how much are you willing to sacrifice - how many people - to get what you want for a town?What kind of person are you; at what point can you no longer look at yourself in the mirror?These are the questions the book asks over and over again, always with different people but always coming back to the main issue. It‚Äôs really nice how the author always comes full circle, explaining people‚Äôs motivations without making excuses for them. Because of course people have reasons; maybe not good ones, but understanding how we got to a point is important nevertheless.I‚Äôm not much of a sports person. I do watch soccer during World and European Championships but never to a level shown here. No matter how good you are at anything, no matter how important the job you do possibly is, you‚Äôre not above the law. That is how I see it. People need to be held accountable for their actions. Period.And that is the next aspect of this novel. Because someone IS being held accountable. And the town doesn‚Äôt like having to look in the mirror and take responsibility for this person turning out the way he/she has, which leads to even more abominable behavior until the final confrontation. The author has an uncanny way of portraying people. The horror of the ordinary, the bleakness of Beartown but also its unrelenting hope, its will to fight, the abominable people who come from money with their sense of entitlement, helicopter parents, insufferable children/teenagers, unconditional best friends, negligent and even violent parents, drunks, racists (or at least people with an aversion towards anyone who is ""different"" or who they think to be ""beneath them""), parents who reflect their own hopes and dreams onto their children until they crush them with their expectations, hard-working people used to making one big sacrifice after another, locker-room talk and ""boys will be boys"" ‚Ä¶ the best and the worst humanity has to offer and every aspect of life as found anywhere in the world.Fredrik Backman doesn‚Äôt shy away from an all too realistic portrayal of what has been and still is going on in the world. From small town life and economic crises, to victim blaming and taking justice into your own hands.I seriously loathe some people in this town. Some I never liked, but only a few have managed to make me hit my steering wheel in frustration because I wanted to see them hurt for what they said and did - and got away with. It was pointed out to me that I‚Äôm too invested, that this is ""just fiction"" but not only is it utterly realistic fiction dealing with real-life hardships, not every author can manage to make you care so fucking much (pardon my French).Backman‚Äôs writing style is beautiful. He‚Äôs one of the rare authors who can gut you with a sentence he casually drops in the middle of a completely harmless scene. And just when I thought the worst was over, he even did that right at the end of the book (making me dread the sequel). It really is extraordinary.Warning: This is only for people who have read this book. I mean it. All others: shoo!I‚Äôm not actually happy with the ending. I wanted Kevin to face up to the entire town. I wanted him humiliated. I wanted him to lose everything. Not just for the rape but also for how he behaved to Benji and Maya and in general despite knowing he was guilty. I know this is supposed to show us the power of mercy but certain people don‚Äôt deserve mercy.Just like all the town's people got off waaay too easily. Consider all the horrible things they said and did and most of them haven't even seen the error of their ways! I know, I know: that's realistic. But I don't care. I'm like Kira. I wanna see them hurt! God, I loved that scene when she went after those brats on their bikes. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!I am, however, pleased with Maya becoming a star and still playing the guitar Amat buys for her (how sweet that he did that despite needing the money so desperately himself).And Benji. How my heart broke for the poor boy. I hope he'll come out of the closet eventually.The way people kept making excuses and stayed silent almost got more to me than the ones being all-out assholes. At least ""the pack"" finally got the message from Ramona but I consider it too little too late.*sighs*I need a break now. The plan was to read the sequel immediately but this book has drenched me emotionally in a way only very few others have managed."

I'll need some time to process thisalright. some time has passed, and even no review of mine could do this book justice, i'll still try. when i put this on my tbr, i had NO idea that this book would be this complex and gripping. fredrik backman's writing is truly beautiful. instead of shoving facts into your face, he tells the story by telling the stories of selected inhabitants of beartown. be it an old hockey coach, a boy that has to hide his homosexuality, or an immigrant woman that wants nothing more than to help her son in every possible way.while the major conflict only starts around 200 pages in, beartown does not get boring. in that time, the writing incites emotions beyond everything.i hardly ever use quotes in my reviews, but this one struck a chord with me:""she's fifteen, above the age of consent, and he's seventeen, but he's still 'the boy' in every concersation. she's 'the young woman'""just...wow. i have never seen storytelling or characterisation like this. backman's writing does not only suck you up, it makes you a part of the action, makes you feel as if everything happened right in front of you.this book will break your heart. the blatant injustice with which the rape is treated hurts, and it is supposed to hurt - because we all know headlines of girls who were ""too drunk"", who ""were obviously flirting"", whose clothing was ""too revealing"", who were ""asking for it"". i shed many, many tears over this book - partially because i felt for maya, and benji, and so many more, but also because i know that the case described is, sadly, anything but fictional. i almost cried while writing this review. read the book. now."

Beartown is a story about small-town hockey and it's community. People with hopes, dreams, heartache, corruption and secrets.The town revolves around it's junior hockey team and they are about to compete in the national semi-finals. It's now up to a group of teenage boys to fulfill the hopes and dreams of Beartown. A violent act occurs against a young girl leaving the town in shock and turmoil. Accusations are made leaving no resident unaffected. The majority of Beartown residents desperately want to believe that this event didn't happen with many having a disturbing feeling that it's true. Unexpected citizens come forward to try to save the town.Backman is a gifted writer when it comes to examining humanity. He creates characters that are so real that we feel as if we know them. And we certainly won't easily forget them.I highly recommend this unique, touching and thought-provoking story!Many thanks to Net Galley and Simon & Schuster for an arc of this novel."
139,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23554868-kels-akiko,Rating 1 out of 5,"Wow, this is the first book I've read from Frederik Backman and it is absolutely terrible. Worst book I have finished.The short review: The writing is unrefined, simplistic, and melodramatically monotoned. The story, which drags on twice as long as necessary, forces cliche characters to face a side-choosing modern moral question (with an obvious right and wrong answer) and thinks that it explores a complex contrived situation with depth, but instead it stumbles through caricatured people having unrealistic, forced conversations all told with an excessive amount of eye-roll-inducing dramatic platitudes.The extended review:The writing style is tawdry, immature, and severely lacking. It was a struggle to keep filling my time and mind with this novel, but I finished it so I could give it an honest and properly complete review - plus it was for a book club.Perhaps the most obnoxious aspect of the format is that every chapter begins with excessive platitudes, aphorisms, and smack you in the face dramatic proses that are constantly repeated throughout each short chapter. We get a solid 50 chapters of:
Its just a game. Except it‚Äôs more. It‚Äôs life. Hockey is everything. This book is about life not hockey. Here is an aphorism or platitude that I want to apply to these characters. * * * Chapter Break * * *Here is some clunky, unnatural dialogue that demonstrates said aphorism in an obvious manner. Explain what the characters are feeling so there can be no room for inference. * * * Chapter Break * * *Repeat a variation of the aphorism or platitude, possibly with another character interaction. Also explain bluntly what these people are thinking and feeling and make clear how it contrasts with the previous example. * * * Chapter Break * * *Did you get that? Let me explain the wisdom frankly.* * * Chapter Break * * *Single line repeat the aphorism or platitude again. End Chapter. 
 The above is the tacky writing style and formula used throughout the entire book. There are too many unnecessary chapter breaks to emphasize some statement that was intended to be weighty and meaningful - the style and low quality philosophy quickly becomes tiresome and obnoxious after the first couple chapters. To make the writing more painful, the plot dragged on excessively long, yet somehow the book had no room for any visible character growth.The overall story, while it offers nothing new, could be fine and done well, but the execution resulted in over the top drama and a tone that takes the trite philosophy too seriously. Backman attempts to write from multiple character perspectives and somehow every single one resulted in a cliche. All the characters are banal melodramatic soap opera caricatures who are told to us not shown by Backman‚Äôs annoying habit of outlining what their passions and thoughts. The entire narrative is told, not shown - the role and for what storytelling purpose of each character was made for is readily apparent.Ultimately, there are nearly no redeeming qualities to this novel - it's bad characters, bad writing, bad technique, and a mediocre been done before plot. This book feels like reading the screenplay for a low budget made for TV movie that, like this review, was repetitive and dragged on too long."

141,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18643650-mark-porton,Rating 2 out of 5,"Oh dear.After reading Anxious People I was really looking forward to this one. This story about the people living in Ice Hockey loving Beartown was dreadful.The characters were cliched, the story was predictable and there was way too much young bloke, ice hockey loving jock type humour. As a sports lover and an ignoramus when it concerns ice hockey, I was keen to learn more. But this story turned me off the game - unfortunately. There were times I thought it would pick up, and in the middle there was certainly some heavy subject matter covered. However, when one starts skimming with a third of the book to go - you know it's all over. 2 Stars"
142,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4811203-emily-b,Rating 4 out of 5,"Beartown is centred around a remote hockey town and its inhabitants. While hockey is a big part of the novel it‚Äôs the community around it that is so gripping. There were a lot of characters in this book which at first I struggled with but soon became a lot more comfortable with. I first became fully immersed around 125 pages in. I loved the dialogue in this novel, it said so much about the characters and their relationships with each other."
143,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30268418-tina-haigler,Rating 4 out of 5,"""Late one evening toward the end of March, a teenager picked up a double-barreled shotgun, walked into the forest, put the gun to someone else's forehead, and pulled the trigger.""I have to admit, I have mixed feelings about this one. When I saw that this book was about hockey, and basing my expectations on A Man Called Ove, I kind of expected a Mighty Ducks vibe. I have to say, I was very, very, very wrong. The author even prefaced my copy with a warning that this particular novel is much darker than his other books. If the author's intro didn't give away the nature of the book, the opening line--quoted above--did. Backman certainly knows how to grab a reader's attention, doesn't he?This book covers a wide range of heavy topics. It's full of violence (and not just typical on the ice incidents), bullying (lot's of it), sexism, as well as classism, with a little xenophobia and homophobia thrown in for good measure. So on one hand, it was an engaging story, but on the other hand, I spent a lot of my time reading it being ridiculously angry. As a woman, the sexism was enough to make me foam at the mouth, let alone all the other infuriating elements thrown in on top of that.I loved the setting, the atmosphere, and the writing. I liked most of the main characters, but there were some I despised. I hated the attitude of the town in general. It was almost a mob mentality because, God forbid, someone mess with their precious little hockey team. I was not particularly happy with most of what happened in the story, but the ending left me with a feeling of pride and justice, even if it wasn't the legal kind. While not every story has to give me the warm fuzzies, I need to be able to take something positive away from the experience. Otherwise, it's not worth reading, because I truly suffer through all those negative feelings and experiences. Extreme empathy isn't always a good thing, and I don't put myself through all that drama for nothing. I'm not an emotional masochist. In the end (triple entendre--add preferred sound effect here), this book delivered and gave me what I needed to move on from all of the doom and gloom held within its pages. I recommend this if you like hockey, Sweden, Scandinavian culture, small towns, cold climates, and/or darker content.""They do that in hockey towns."""
144,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,Rating 5 out of 5,"Going in, I thought Beartown was going to be about a down-on-its-luck hockey town trying to win a championship. But it turned out to be so much more than that. The central conflict, which I won't give away, is portrayed with so much heart, complexity, and raw emotions. It felt so real that I had to read this book slowly, taking deep breathes and frequent breaks just so that my heart didn't burst.There are so many strong and lovable characters in here, including Maya, Kira, Peter, Ana, Amat and so many more. It's great when an author can capture one real three-dimensional character in a book's pages, but to craft so many of individuals and make them all come alive is astounding. This book covers so much, about loyalty, sacrifice, love of self versus love of community, belonging, bonds of family and friends, morality, what we teach our children through our actions and our words. And Backman does it all in a cohesive tale. At times during the first half, it feels like the book could have been more concise, but Backman's beautiful writing and wise insights more than makes up for the slower initial pace.Simply put, this book blew me away!"
145,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4125660-liz,Rating 5 out of 5,"While this is a very different book than A Man Called Ove, Backman brings the same ability to capture a character‚Äôs essence in just a sentence or two. ‚ÄúHer mom isn't the sort you argue with; her mom is a lawyer, and she never quite stops being one‚Äù. Or ‚Äúyou never want to get away from home as much as you do when you're fifteen years old‚Äù. This is a poignant novel. A whole town‚Äôs hopes are riding on the success of their junior hockey team. So much pressure on the backs of these teenagers. And these kids already have so much pressure, just from life. ‚ÄúOne day he'll stop adding and subtracting income and expenditures in his head all the time. There's an obvious difference between the children who live in homes where the money can run out and the ones who don't. How old are you when you realize that also makes a difference.‚Äù And it's not just the boys. The girls are dealing with their own issues. ‚ÄúFew disappointments can compare with the way you feel the first time your best friend dumps you for a boy.‚Äù Backman‚Äôs writing is flat out gorgeous and poetic. I wanted to highlight about every other sentence in this book. I'm a fast reader, but I found I wanted to really slow down and savor the story. It makes you want to reach out and hug every one of the main characters. Of course, as the book goes on, you want to do something other than hug some of them. ‚ÄúWe become what we are told we are‚Äù. For better or worse, this plays out. This book brought back memories for me about a lot of news stories. The UVA lacrosse player that killed his girlfriend. Football plays like Ben Roethlisberger. My only complaint is that at times, his writing comes across as didactic. You see the points he's trying to make, you don't need to be hit over the head with them. If I hadn‚Äôt loved the story so much, this might have warranted a deduction in stars. But I would have rated it higher than five if I could have, so still a five in my book. This book is amazing. To be able to elicit such a range of emotions from me in such short order. Is it a cliche to compare reading it to a roller coaster? I can see this being made into a movie. In fact, I was surprised when I googled Beartown movie rights to not find they had already been sold. I can't recommend this one highly enough. Sure to be one of my favorites of 2017. "
146,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53067896-amina,Rating 4 out of 5,"Wow! This book was a massive departure from Fredrik Backman's usual reads. It reminded me a lot of the show 'Friday Night Lights' (if anyone wants to watch a tv show with the same fundamental elements).This is the story of Beartown, a small town that loves Hockey. They live, breath, and literally drink (in large doses of coffee) the sport. It's a coming of age story that hits all the elements of pain, love, heartache, loyalty, defiance, and suffering. The hockey team symbolizes hope for a community that has nothing more than bitter cold and forests. There is a large cast of characters, and the first half of the book spends an extensive amount of time setting up their stories, which at times felt too detailed, but in the end, it all comes together. Then...The incident that flips the town on its head. The community, the coaches, the players, the fans all weigh in. It was astounding to see what side of the conflict the townspeople land on. Beartown reminds you of the few strong ones that fight against evil and those that will join or continue to shade themselves behind a lie.   ‚ÄúIt doesn't take long to persuade each other to stop seeing a person as a person. And when enough people are quiet for long enough, a handful of voices can give the impression that everyone is screaming.""  Beartown, at times is infuriating, gut wrenching, and painful. Other times, warm, inviting, and heartwarming. Backman writes in a brillian, creative way--the conversations flowing. Even though the story doesn't end in a perfect knot, there is still some redemption. I recently read another sports heavy book (Carrie Soto is Back) and I was overwhelmed and bogged down by the elements of the sport. I liked that Beartown talks about hockey, but doesn't waste time teaching us about the game like we need to pass a test after. This is more a drama, set in the confounds of a hockey town. The story remains interesting, the drama worthy of attention. Overall, a great read. 4/5 stars."

I ended up listening to both audiobooks back to back last year and really enjoyed them. I'm not entirely sure why I didn't update or write a review for the books, but I did have a lot going on at the time. I also have a harder time writing reviews for audiobooks unless I make notes right away. I'm getting better at taking a moment or two to jot a few things down as I listen. I recently started reading Backman's upcoming ""Anxious People"" and wanted to add my two cents about these books too. ""Beartown"" did get off to a bit of a slow start for me but once I got a little farther into it, I was hooked! Once I was finished I immediately started listening to ""Us Against Them"". Both were excellent reads that I highly recommend!"

Everyone said it was amazing, yet it still took me by surprise. The depth of feeling it evoked, the love I developed for every single one of the characters -- I simultaneously didn't want it to end but couldn't wait to see what happened.In the beginning I was a little frustrated with how slow the story was to develop, but I quickly recognized -- and came to appreciate -- how necessary and intentional that was. The time Backman spent developing each character, as well as Beartown itself, made you know them intimately and care for them deeply.This was quite a first book for 2018. I'm not sure how anything else I read this year can live up to it -- it has earned a firm place in my top 10 books of all time. All I can say is READ IT."

I have thoughts on organized sports that go against the mainstream. However, it was my book groups choice and frankly one of the reasons I'm in a book group is to broaden my range of books.  That said, I immediately fell in love with Bachman's writing voice. Wonder if wonders! I enjoyed A Man called Ove very much, but here the authors voice was different - more overtly philosophical. More along the lines of, ""Pull up a chair friends and sit awhile. I have a story to tell and it's not just any story""  And I fell in love with his voice, his rhythm of repeating phrases, the people - oh my gosh I loved the people major, minor, good and horrid. And darn if even the horrid didn't receive some redemption by the end. I read this book on my kindle and I only mention that because I noticed that GR had tracked the fact that I had 255 places where I highlighted (used three colors) and written notes. And I fell in love with this book.  Around the middle it became difficult going for a while - I couldn't imagine where else he was going w the story and I thought it would never end. But of course I trusted the author - sighed deeply a few times - and pressed on. And I fell in love with the story and people and powerful writing all over again reading straight through to the ending and beyond.  There is enough wisdom, enough exploration of dozens of themes like friendship, parenting, leadership both of community and individuals, the life and art of coaching, career highs and lows, becoming adults, loss of many kinds, challenges of growing up, parent child relationships, how we send our youth different messages based on their gender, class differences, immigrants, the painful struggles for survival in small towns, and of course the many roles of passion for a sport can play - enough wisdom to fill several books.  My Board of Education friend said she would not want to the one to bring this book up for approval for the high school students and yet we all agreed how it is a book that would be a perfect community read because these are themes that touch all of our lives.  I'm very happy I read this extraordinarily well-written and thought provoking novel filled with people stories that matter. But it was often an uncomfortable read for me. Quotes:Why does anyone care about hockey?  Perhaps it depends on who you are and where. Because it tells stories.Never trust people who don't have something in their lives that they love beyond all reason.

After reading A Man Called Ove, I really didn't think he could get much better than that, but he did. Goodness. I think I'm going to let this sink in a little bit, marinate in it, before writing a more detailed review. For now, all I can say is this book gave me all the feels. Wow! Just wow!"
152,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54835325-kat,Rating 5 out of 5,"What an amazing book. So many character perspectives. Such a heartbreaking and touching look at a small town deeply affected by isolation and lack of opportunity, and one that doesn't want to confront its own prejudices. Hockey is everything in Beartown, sometimes the one bright spot when jobs are leaving, it's cold and dark in the winter, and all you have to look forward to is a factory job, if you're lucky. Communication isn't the town's strong suit. It's a completely different environment from where I live, but how many of us can't relate to that isolated small town feel and the way that if you fall on the ""wrong"" side of public opinion, it can make your life hell?It's just brilliant the way author Fredrik Backman takes us through the perspective of so many characters because we see the town through those varied eyes. Too many to write here, but in short, a crime occurs and it's one teen's word against another's.  The town decides it will side with one, and the book does an outstanding job of examining rape culture, as well as hate speech and prejudice against homosexuality and immigrants. One of the most poignant scenes in the book comes near the end when David, who has been the coach of the junior's team since the boys were 7, and has been a father figure for Kevin and Benji, but also participated in and allowed crude jokes about homosexuality to be shouted on the bus, on the ice, and in the locker room, witnesses Benji kissing another boy. Rather than being disgusted, he begins to cry, realizes how horribly he has failed, that Benji would have thought he had to hide such a thing about himself from him. Just so many great moments.

154,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21992464-helene-jeppesen,Rating 3 out of 5,"To begin with, this book started out really strong. The thump-thump-thump of the icehockey puck sounded throughout the introduction of the village of Beartown and the people we were going to meet and follow over the next 400 pages. I liked how Backman created an atmosphere and really made me understand how important icehockey was to everyone. The problem with this book, though, was that its narrator became too philosophizing and moralizing. This was okay to start with, but during my reading of ‚ÄúBeartown‚Äù I became increasingly annoyed with it. Furthermore, the novel drags on for too long, in my opinion, and I found it harder and harder to pick it up towards the end. Despite my love for Fredrik Backman and his quirky stories, this one felt like it was too much and too heavy. In the end I think it‚Äôs probably one of my least favourite books I‚Äôve read of his, unfortunately - even though 3 stars means that I still enjoyed it and would recommend it to other Backman fans.

155,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19611831-cherie,Rating 5 out of 5,"¬†¬†¬†¬† Beartown is very much a character driven plot. There are a lot of characters in play, but it all comes together well. The plot introduces you to teen hockey players who are team stars treated like ""gods"" who can get away with just about anything. Their parents need lessons in being disciplinarians or how to be involved in their kids lives. ¬†¬†¬†¬† The first half is pretty much getting to know the characters, and the pace is slow, so patience is definetely needed by the reader. At the half point, a major act of violence occurs, and every character is affected. How the plot continues and ends from this violent act is unpredictable for the reader. Your patience will be rewarded by the second half as everything begins to spiral out of control in this small hockey town."
156,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7487619-rachel-theshadesoforange,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 StarsI rarely read contemporary fiction, but this one pulled me right from the start. The narrative is very slow paced, yet I found myself enthralled by the characters and the town culture. While this is a book about a hockey town, it is really not a ""sports books"". In fact, it may very well appeal most to those outside of the fandom. I really connected with the perspective of the working mother, seeing so much of myself in that woman. I also loved that the book addressed such incredibly important topics in such a thoughtful manner. Highly recommend this one to readers looking for stories that address darker topics. This novel definitely lived up to the hype."
157,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,Rating 3 out of 5,"Beartown, a declining hamlet in the middle of a Swedish forest, has one big hope - ice hockey. Beartown's junior hockey team, the Bears, has made it to the national semi-finals, and - if they go on to win a championship - might attract a new sports arena to Beartown, along with tournaments, hotels, tourist traffic, and so on. This boon to Beartown's economy would be welcome to business owners, residents, and hockey sponsors. Thus, the high school boys who play for the Bears are pressured by both personal ambition and the dreams of everyone around them. The Bears' star player is the team captain, Kevin, a 17-year-old phenomenon who's been practicing day and night since he was a kid. Kevin's best friend is Benji, the team's 'enforcer' - who protects his squad from opposing players during games. Benji and the other Bears look up to Kevin and are intensely loyal to him. Kevin's mother and father - a wealthy, successful couple - are proud of their son's achievements and have high hopes for his future. In some ways, however, Kevin's parents are oddly distant. They travel frequently, rarely attend hockey practices, and seem to brush off signs of boyish misbehavior. Since hockey is Beartown's obsession, the adults who run the Hockey League are always in the public eye. These include the league's General Manager Peter - who made it to the Canadian pros before returning to Beartown; the junior team coach David - whose sole mantra is ""Win""; the A-team (older boys) coach Sune - a hockey veteran who's about to be replaced; and the board of directors/sponsors - who pull the strings behind the scenes. Many of these men are anxious - and losing sleep - in anticipation of the important upcoming games. The first part of the book introduces the major characters in the story. In addition to the people mentioned above, this includes: the other teenage boys on the junior team and their families; the pub owner - an upstanding woman who's still mourning the death of her long-dead husband; Peter's 15-year-old daughter Maya - an aspiring guitarist/singer;Maya's best friend Anna - who has a troubled home life; Peter's wife Kira - a high-powered business attorney; David's pregnant girlfriend - who keeps him centered; and more. The initial chapters also establish the ambiance in Beartown - a village that eats, breathes, and sleeps hockey, hockey, hockey. Kids in Little League hockey hope to play for the Bears; Bears players dream of becoming pros; and everyone in town basks in the league's reflected glory. In addition, hopes for economic success related to hockey light up a lot of Beartown eyes.The future of Beartown looks pretty bright until things go badly wrong.As part of the revelry in Beartown - and with his parents away - Kevin throws a big bash at his house.....with plenty of booze. The teenage boys and girls at the party drink too much, and - at one point - Kevin takes Maya to his room and won't take no for an answer. When Maya reports the assault, Beartown becomes a divided town - with a pro-Kevin cabal and a (much smaller) pro-Maya faction. In many ways this is par for the course. Most readers are probably aware of news stories about 'entitled males' (athletes, politicians, celebrities, business moguls, etc.) who take advantage of females.....with little or no fear of negative consequences. Kevin seems poised to join this maleficent group since most Beartown citizens are determined to deny (or excuse) his bad behavior. After all, Kevin is a hockey star!!.Thus, there's a lot of ugly talk and bad conduct directed toward Maya and her family. The author handles these trends deftly, showing us the self-justifications and rationalizations of the people involved. Of course there's no real excuse for this kind of thing, and I was quite disturbed by the book's theme. (In fact, I wish Backman would have chosen some other topic to write about.) Still, several Beartown residents DO step up in an admirable fashion, much to their credit.'Beartown' is well-written, the characters are engaging, and I like the mini-epilogs, which give us a glimpse of the future of some Beartownians. I think many readers would enjoy this book and I'd recommend it to fans of hockey, literary fiction, and Frederik Backman. You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot...."

Spoiler alert: He‚Äôs done it again! 
Fredrik Backman you‚Äôre one hell of a writer. I read three of your novels and thought I had you all figured out. But then you wrote Beartown and managed to surprise me. Big time!Beartown is a small town on the decline. Fewer jobs are available, the property values are decreasing, there isn't much to lift this town or keep it together, except for hockey, junior hockey. The hockey fever has overtaken Beartown, as the junior team is playing in the league semi-final. Imagine being a high school kid and having to deal with so much: the pressure of the competition that you‚Äôd naturally feel, the pressure of the club through its board members and sponsors, also, the parents' and town‚Äôs expectations. Hockey is an obsession. It‚Äôs also a way to get validation and a get-out-of-town card.We are in many ways influenced by our environment. This small town in the forest, with its endless cold and dark months, feels claustrophobic, more so for some of its inhabitants. Most people are simple, set in their ways, not very accepting of people who are different or have aspirations that are different to their own. The double standards that still apply to women are even more discernible in a small town. I appreciated Backman‚Äôs ability to portray the inner turmoil that goes inside so many women who have aspirations and needs beyond those of just being wives and mothers. Unsurprisingly, nobody‚Äôs life is simple. Everybody has hang-ups, inner struggles or real struggles, regrets and disappointments. For many, life didn‚Äôt quite turn up as they‚Äôd imagined. ‚ÄùBitterness can be corrosive. It can rewrite your memories as if it were scrubbing a crime scene clean, until in the end you only remember what suits you of its causes.‚Äù Beartown is quite the departure from the previous Backman novels, which were inhabited by many quirky characters. This novel is darker, grittier. The writing style is different as well. What‚Äôs not different is Backman‚Äôs ability to create realistic, complex characters, regardless of their age, gender or backgrounds.This novel has a huge cast of characters. The protagonists are the hockey players and their families, the coaches, the general manager and his wife and kids. Teachers, bar owners, businessmen are also part of the cast. Some of the characters are given more air-time than others, still, none of them is redundant. Incredibly enough, I never got confused about who‚Äôs who, which only demonstrates, again, Backman‚Äôs incredible skill.Great writers are also great psychologists. They speak life‚Äôs truths in a way that allows us to connect, relate, and understand. They also hold up a mirror to ourselves and society. Backman‚Äôs craftsmanship accomplished all that and more in Beartown.  I‚Äôve received this novel via Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review. I am so grateful to Atria Books for granting me access. "

It captured so much of the human experience and was both heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time. As someone who grew up in small sports towns this one hit close to home. It‚Äôs a book about hockey, but more specifically it‚Äôs a book about a hockey town and what people are willing to coverup and overlook for the sake of a great sports team and talented athletes. It‚Äôs about how often in towns like this, because you‚Äôre good at a sport your life and future somehow have more value than those who aren‚Äôt. This was giving Friday night lights (the tv show) vibes and if you‚Äôre reading this thinking it sounds exaggerated or that this doesn‚Äôt actually happen in small towns, it does."

I was just not all that interested, and then after a 100 pages or so I had time to settle and start to like the book. With a large ensemble cast, and some interesting perspectives on humanity, once I got into it, I enjoyed the experience.The plot-a small rural town, Beartown, whose local hockey team is the biggest thing going. The team is on the verge of greatness, and then there is a rape. Things progress rapidly from there. BEARTOWN is told from the point-of-view of a third person omniscient narrator, so the reader is in the heads of most of the large cast of characters at some point. This novel is the story of a place. Some of the inhabitants of that place I loved, some I loathed‚Ä¶but for most of them I simply had moments of liking and disliking them. Because they are humans, and if I am honest that sometimes liking/sometimes disliking is how I feel about most people. The characters in this book are very human, and thus they are not all one thing or another, but an amalgamation of good and bad. Fredrik Backman does that very well in this novel, creating people who are a mix of contradictory characteristics. As a result, they are interesting.While reading this novel there would be a thought that would come out of the blue that would make me take pause. The following lines are one such instance‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúA long marriage is complicated. So complicated, in fact, that most people in one sometimes ask themselves: ‚ÄòAm I still married because I am in love, or just because I can‚Äôt be bothered to let anyone else get to know me this well again?‚Äô‚Äù It is an uncomfortable thought, and in all honesty the truth is probably somewhere in the middle for most folks.Some quotes that I liked, for various reasons:‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThe town wakes early, like it does every day; small towns need a head start if they‚Äôre going to have any chance in the world.‚Äù‚Ä¢	‚ÄúNever trust people who don‚Äôt have something in their lives that they love beyond all reason.‚Äù‚Ä¢	‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been old for a long time, but is really feeling it today.‚Äù‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThat‚Äôs both a big and a small thing. Knowing that there are people who will never abandon you.‚Äù‚Ä¢	‚ÄúReligion is something between you and other people; it‚Äôs full of interpretations and theories and opinions. But faith‚Ä¶that‚Äôs between you and God.‚Äù‚Ä¢	‚ÄúLoneliness is an invisible ailment.‚Äù‚Ä¢	‚ÄúBut isolating yourself happens faster than you might think‚Ä¶‚Äù‚Ä¢	‚ÄúHumanity has many shortcomings, but none is stronger than pride.‚Äù‚Ä¢	‚ÄúEveryone has a thousand wishes before a tragedy, but just one afterward.‚Äù‚Ä¢	‚ÄúWords are not small things.‚Äù‚Ä¢	‚ÄúBig secrets turn us into small men.‚Äù‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThere are damn few things in life that are harder than admitting to yourself that you‚Äôre a hypocrite.‚Äù‚Ä¢	‚ÄúSometimes life doesn‚Äôt let you choose your battles. Just the company you keep.‚ÄùMr. Backman likes tidy endings. This text is no exception. I did not mind it. In the end this is really just a novel about people, living their lives, reacting to the things around them. And like all of us, sometimes they succeed in that endeavor better than at others."
162,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,Rating 5 out of 5,"If this review sounds like it was written by some octogenarian who sounds like he was forced to watch the latest Marvel movie and discovered that he liked it, THERE'S A REASON. ;)My caveat: I am not a huge hockey fan. In fact, when it comes to most books or tv shows or movies related to any kind of sporty topic, I'm already rounding down or trying to find any kind of excuse to run away from it.Why? I grew up with this s**te. I generally hated the hometown band-together-for-the-team mentality and privately called them all tribal yokels and worse. Let's have an institutionalized us-versus-them mentality, shall we? We can step up our witch hunts and hand out blinders to everyone equally.Sigh.So I read this book about a little hard-nosed hockey town because I was forced to. Truth. Someone held my head in position and kept poking me with a burning branch until I finished enough that I would have to do the rest on my own thanks to my OCD that comes with books. HAVE TO FINISH! So yeah, I did, and you know what? I enjoyed myself. The wide range of characters with all kinds of flaws butted heads against reality in all the worst ways. Good men and women did bad things and bad men and women did good things. There might have been some feels in here for me.But more than anything, this is the kind of book that gives fans and non-fans and everyone who might have the slightest bit ambivalence about the crap that goes on in these kinds of insular communities a good long pause. You can say that shit happens, that rapes happen, that star players can and should get off free and clear. Or, you can be on the shotgun's side. I might be on the shotgun's side.So, yeah, beautifully written, sprawling, a panoramic hoard of vivid characters, and a town torn apart. What's not to love? Issues of rape versus the ""greater good"" smothers these pages and *should* hit everyone in the gut. So yeah, this isn't just a hockey novel. I'll give it that.:)"

But a party, exorbitant amount of booze, toxic masculinity and a whole lot of rape culture later, it‚Äôs bye-bye my cute ship and hello hell for the victim (and her family).That‚Äôs all I got to say for this book. My issue is deeply personal. Beartown caught me totally off guard, I didn‚Äôt know it would be about this topic.

The writing was excellent the emotional depth completely overwhelming. I don't read books with rape. I don't like to see it used as entertainment. There was nothing here but brutal honesty about all the views. Each person had a different reaction, different reasoning, it was painful to read at times. I finished this book and didn't feel good. I'm glad I read it now, but if I had known what it was about before I picked it up I wouldn't have read it. I read for release, escape, the dream, not a nasty dose of reality like this book went into. I am rating this on my feelings on the book not the writing.Humans can be so cruel. Humans can be such selfish jerks. Humans can reason anything no matter how horrible if it make sit easier on them. Humans justifying rape is WRONG. The mentality of this town is so wrong. Humans will fight dirty to stay in the crowd. Humans can also be kind, unwavering and wonderful but these standouts can be rare in tough times.This book, arguh, emotional roller coaster. I've known all these people at one time in my life. The realistic feel of them makes the punch in the gut more painful. It's all begins to decline with the rape of a 15 year old girl. You know the story, you've herd in on the news on TV shows, the blame game. Mr. Backman takes us to a deeper level and to the outer levels of this traumatic event. How Hockey rules over empathy, over friends, over family in this town and how it goes down, down."

166,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy,Rating 1 out of 5," Well. One of the ways I sometimes feel like I might be truly crazy but just don't know it, is when so many readers love a book, give it 5 stars and rave reviews, and I find it awful, deplorable, even possibly dangerous. I purely hated this book. I'll admit the story has a can't-look-away quality to it, so because I read it for my favorite reading group and because it was recommended to the group by a good friend, I got through it. I will just say that over and above the facts that the characters are cliches and the author continuously tells the reader what she should think about every incident, the bottom line is this: a 14-year-old girl is raped by a 16-year-old hockey star and he totally gets away with it. The author curiously did not tell the reader what to think about that.Mansplaining, predatory males, male sports heroes who get away with despicable actions; I know what I think about all that. In light of the recent disclosures about Harvey Weinstein, I cannot and will not recommend this book to anyone. Perhaps I read it wrong, but I don't think so."

The plot is robust but it takes a long time to get through it."

169,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91622714-rosh,Rating 5 out of 5,"I am so stumped about how to review this book but not because I didn't enjoy it. There are so many things I want to say but words fail me. This is the story of a town that wants to adhere to its set ways. The story of the townspeople, who have to accept the roles they are supposed to play, whether it correlates with the way they are or not is immaterial. The story of a game that is seeped into the town culture to such an extent that it is seen as an escape as well as a scourge. This book provides the best example of how review spoilers can damage a story experience. I went into this book assuming that it was a typical sports novel. And I was stunned to see the turn it took. Had I known beforehand about this part of the story, I would have lost out on that thrill of anticipation, the shock of discovery, the pain of uncovering the true faces underneath the external facades.Coming from a tropical country that barely has any winter and knows zilch about ice hockey, I found reading about a place where sub-zero winter is dominant and ice hockey is almost a religious obsession a surreal experience. But no where does the lack of personal know-how affect the book experience. Because the experiences of Beartown, with all its highs and lows, can be transposed to every place and culture regardless of country. The story begins slowly, like a wood fire that is struggling to come to life underneath the dry wood, but once it gets going, the flames are hypnotic, you can feel the heat blazing from every spark, you realise the purpose of every log, you see how the inferno doesn't belong to a particular part of the base but to the whole... Similarly, every single character has a role to play in this book. You might struggle with remembering the huge cast at first but they are so wonderfully described that you'll recognise them soon enough. If any aspiring writer needs a master class on character sketching, this would be a great book to refer to.I'm deliberately staying away from revealing anything about the story because I want you to experience the same thrill of discovery as I did. After all, the title tells you that this book is about Beartown. But the story will reveal that it is equally about its people. About Hockey. Choices. Decisions. Team spirit. Families. Friendships. Silence. Shame. Courage. Gender differences. Social roles. Expectations. Pressures. It's tough to draw a line about what's primary and what secondary in the themes. Everything is interconnected, and everything is essential. What you remember at the end of a book though is not the writing, the characters, the vocabulary... What you remember is how the book made you feel. If a book stays with you long after you have turned over the last page, you will remember it with a nostalgic fondness in spite of flaws. And that's Beartown for me. It has its blemishes, but the positives far outweigh the negatives. This is a book that will stay with me for a long time.Here are some of the nuggets from the plentiful food for thought available in this lovely book. ‚òò Never trust people who don‚Äôt have something in their lives that they love beyond all reason.‚òò How big is the world when you‚Äôre twelve years old? Both infinite and infinitesimal.‚òò There are two things that are particularly good at reminding us how old we are: children and sports.‚òò One of the plainest truths about both towns and individuals is that they usually don‚Äôt turn into what we tell them to be, but what they are told they are.‚òò If you tell a child it can do absolutely anything, or that it can‚Äôt do anything at all, you will in all likelihood be proven right.‚òò Any living thing that is kept behind bars for long enough eventually becomes more scared of the unknown than its own captivity.‚òò Everyone has a thousand wishes before a tragedy, but just one afterward.‚òò Humanity has many shortcomings, but none is stronger than pride.‚òò All adults have days when we feel completely drained. When we no longer know quite what we spend so much time fighting for, when reality and everyday worries overwhelm us and we wonder how much longer we‚Äôre going to be able to carry on. The wonderful thing is that we can all live through far more days like that without breaking than we think. The terrible thing is that we never know exactly how many.‚òò Culture is as much about what we encourage as what we permit.‚òò It‚Äôs always easier to lecture other people about morality when you‚Äôve never had to answer for anything yourself.ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ Sometimes life doesn‚Äôt let you choose your battles. Just the company you keep.***********************Join me on the Facebook group,

170,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4863523-laysee,Rating 4 out of 5,"I know next to nothing about ice hockey but for the past week, I played it vicariously with a fearless and dedicated team of adolescent boys in Beartown, a sleepy town at the edge of a forest. As in any sport, one plays to win. But that means sweat and blood ‚Äì an exacting demand of sacrifice from each player. It is hard to imagine the pressure experienced by each member of the Beartown junior team as they compete in the semi-final match of the most anticipated minor-league tournament, the biggest youth tournament in the country. A game such as this carried the hopes and dreams not just of the players but of their parents and in fact, the entire town.Beartown is a hockey town that has lost its shine. Folks who can afford it have moved away to bigger cities and commerce has declined. The people of Beartown pin their hopes on winning because  ‚ÄòBeing the best junior team around would remind the rest of the country of this place‚Äôs existence again.‚Äô The reality for Beartown is: ‚ÄòHockey is becoming more than hockey, it‚Äôs becoming tourism, a trade-mark, capital. Survival.‚Äô I wanted very much for Beartown to hold its head high again.Backman created a troop of incredible young characters ‚Äì Kevin, Benji, Bobo, Amat, Zach, Lyt, Maya, Ana ‚Äì and gave each a backstory that allows the reader to know them quite intimately. Amongst them are youths who live in poverty or have lost a parent, are bullied or ostracized. The one I felt most tenderly for is pint-size Amat, the cleaner‚Äôs son. He is considered too weak even though he is fastest on his skates. He is ‚ÄòTired of trying to prove he was more than the things they called him: a zero from the Hollow.‚Äô I began to root for him and the underdogs. Another hero is Ramona, a widow and owner of a pub. Spunky and straight-talking, she is the unofficial psychologist and to my mind, the conscience of this community.Beartown is about sportsmanship and what it means to be a coach or mentor. Two coaches are pitched against each other: Sune (age 70) versus David (age 32). They have different philosophies that inform their strategies of how to motivate a team. What they have in common is their dedication to hockey and their love for the boys, which I found inspiring.I have to admit that it took me quite a long while to get into this novel. When characters were introduced one by one in quick succession, I grew impatient and wondered if I could keep track of the boys. I also did not appreciate the teenage talk, much of which was unsavoury. Then on the night of the minor league hockey semi-finals, an act of violence shook the whole town and moved the plot into a swifter and more engaging gear. This was when I once again saw Backman‚Äôs perceptive understanding of parenthood, the umbilical cord that cannot be severed. One question that Backman raised is: Can parents protect their children? The parents of Beartown are put to severe testing. An omniscient narrator offers hints of what is to come, and this kept me curious and anxious to keep on reading. Even as the story ends, Beartown meets new challenges. One also catches glimpses of life for these characters ten years into the future. And now I cannot wait to read the two other novels in this series.It‚Äôs been four years since I have read a novel by Fredrik Backman. The marks of an accomplished raconteur are obvious once more. This is a well told story that makes us think about friendship, loyalty, justice, good, and evil. A very satisfying read."

173,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1640163-candace,Rating 5 out of 5,"""Culture, Values, Community"" is the motto of the Beartown Ice Hockey Club. It's junior team is playing in the semifinal. All the hopes of Beartown are resting on the shoulders of the team. Kevin, Benji, Bobo, Amat and William are five of the twelve team members, ages 13 to 17 years old, who carry the aspirations of Beartown. David, the coach, and Peter, the general manager, are shouldering the responsibility of the hopes and dreams of the whole town. If the junior team wins the semifinal, and then the final, the prospect is jobs, hockey school and increased recognition. But one night of revelry will test the bonds of the club motto. This novel is splendid. It takes off slow with the introduction of several characters. It is written using an omniscient narrator which permits the reader to get closer to the different characters. Competitor or enthusiast, we experience the control, hope, anger, courage, love and pain of the players, staff, sponsors, board, townspeople, parents and siblings. The plot and subplots are so finely written the reader is drawn into the story effortlessly. The setting is a character in itself. The description is so vivid the five senses come alive. Each scene captures the essence of a hockey town. The story contains several stereotypes -- the view of women in career and family, the peer pressure of body image, and the view of a small town. Fredrik Backman has written an outstanding novel. I highly recommend it."

‚Äúyou never stop being scared of falling from the top, because when you close your eyes you can still feel the pain from each and every step of the way up.‚Äù

i am not sure how to write a review for this book, because my heart hurts so much. this is the best book of 2021 i have read (and i know it‚Äôs only november and i‚Äôll read more books), but no contest. this book is brilliant and heartwrenching and heartwarming all the same, and i think everyone needs to read it.this is a slow book, so you have to pull through for a bit. backman‚Äôs writing is gorgeous, i knew this from a man called ove, but beartown was a whole other level. it‚Äôs one of those books that you have to push through the first part a bit to be rewarded in the end. he builds a world within this small town through the eyes of more than ten characters, all of different ages and genders and dreams. it doesn‚Äôt pick up until the middle, and then i couldn‚Äôt put it down. this book is so darkly realistic and incredibly uplifting all at the same time.in beartown, their main economy comes from hockey. high school hockey, to be exact. it‚Äôs a tiny, inconsequential town to those who don‚Äôt live there. but they are damn good at hockey and they are given a chance to bring in a lot of buzz and attention when the junior hockey team qualifies for the semi finals. in this town, the teen boys who play hockey are not boys. they‚Äôre celebrities, the most important people in beartown. thus, backman explores toxic masculinity, sports culture, and the consequences of blind idolization.i found myself crying (one of those cathartic cries, not rage cries @ a little life) at so many of the relationships. backman is an expert at writing about people and the connections that make us human; the relationships between parents and children, married couple, friends, coaches and players‚Äîit all amounted to the contents of a powerful, superior novel.(especially peter and kira because they reminded me so much of my own parents).because i love this book so much, i am not going to talk about the plot because i think it‚Äôs best & hits the most when going in blind. but please, please read this. also, please check the trigger warnings!bottom line is: i literally want to learn swedish just so i can read this book in its original language."

I know almost nothing about hockey, nor do I wish to in general, though I have gone to a hockey game once when I lived in Atlanta and thought that was kind of fun. So despite my ambivalence towards the sport, I found myself really surprised by how interested I was in this story which really revolved A LOT around hockey. Though in some ways, if not most ways, it wasn't about hockey at all. This book made me sad, angry, heart broken, and hopeful. This isn't a feel-good story, but it did leave me feeling good about how the book ended.For those who have read A Man Called Ove, this book is almost nothing like that. Also, fair warning, this book has a LOT of characters in it. At first it's very overwhelming but if you stick with it, it's worth it."

 (please don‚Äôt revoke my Canadian citizenship!)
 however, I did grow up in a hockey town. Our town had only one grocery store, and no mall or movie theatre, but it had a fancy, remodeled ice rink that was nicer than any of the neighbouring towns, by far. The hockey players that attended our high school got good grades simply for playing on the local Junior B team, and they got excused from major papers or assignments if they had a game the night before. We accepted it- that was just the way it was. Everyone went to hockey games and only the popular girls dated the hockey players. When you have a town that prides itself on hockey, and builds its foundation on the game itself, you can understand a story like ‚ÄúBear Town‚Äù.‚ÄùBear Town‚Äù by Frederik Backman is a story about a small town that is built on hockey. The town that should have been deserted and abandoned years ago only stands because of its ice rinks and the talent they bring out. The teenagers who play are faced with pressures greater than they can deal with, all for ‚Äúthe love of the game‚Äù. However, when a young girl is raped and a small-town hockey superstar is accused, Bear Town is torn in two- the side who believe the young girl, and the side who believe that hockey is more important than the truth. This story has a lot of characters- the kids who play on the team of course, as well as the young girl who cries rape and her best friend. Then there‚Äôs the general manager of the team, the coach and all of the former players who still live in the same small town where they rose to hockey stardom. Each character gets a small piece of the plot, with a few getting larger pieces than others. Each one is well-developed and flawed, and a reader can easily identify with at least one, if not more, of the story‚Äôs characters. For a large portion of the beginning of the novel, there is a lot of hockey talk. They don‚Äôt use any of the jargon, so the story is easy to understand, but the general hockey politics and structure of teams is covered in detail. It‚Äôs a little rough to get through this part, but once ‚Äúthe incident‚Äù happens- the story takes off like a shot. ‚ÄúBear Town‚Äù quickly becomes addicting and suspense-fueled, and I read rapidly through its pages, desperate to know how it all turns out. (The ending is extremely realistic but also uplifting and powerful). Backman is known for his powerful novels and this is no exception. ‚ÄúBear Town‚Äù will particularly speak to hockey fans, but anyone who understands the politics of small towns or even the dynamic of small town sports teams will identify with this story.

Humanity has many shortcomings, but none is stronger than pride.

 Holy sobfest! WHAT. A. BOOK.Of the 200+ books I'll read this year, I'll be able to count on one hand those that fall outside of the romance genre - and I'm so happy that Beartown is among them!WOW, JUST WOW. Its depth and emotion swept me up and made a good attempt to drown me in my own tears, but I wouldn't change having read it for anything. This is one of those books that every reader on the planet should experience.It started out SLOW . . . Hockey, zzzzzz. Small town minutiae, zzzzz. Mostly unlikable characters, zzzzz. No chance of romance, zzzzz. Why was I reading this again? Oh yeah, because I had to put my name on a waiting list of 59 people at my library to get my hands on it. Plus, two of my most-trusted friends here on GR raved about it. There had to be something worthwhile in this book, right?Damn right.By about 15% my interest was holding . . . those unlikable characters and their everyday lives began to worm their way under my skin. And the hockey was just a structure on which the author carefully laid the groundwork for what he had to say. 

Leadership is as much about what you don't say as what you do say.

 And holy shit, you guys, this author had a ton to say. By giving us a cross-section of the inhabitants of this small Swedish town - young and old, male and female, rich and poor - who are polarized by a tragic event, Backman delved into humanity and its weaknesses and strengths. 

Hate can be a deeply stimulating emotion. The world becomes much easier to understand and much less terrifying if you divide everything and everyone into friends and enemies, we and they, good and evil. The easiest way to unite a group isn't through love, because love is hard. It makes demands. Hate is simple.

 It may sound like the author is being preachy, but I'd disagree. He takes the reader inside the minds of so many unique voices - including the victim and the perpetrator - and presents such a crystal clear picture of their motivations, triggers, and reasoning that I was left in awe. 

We become what we are told we are.

 To say the least, I'm glad that I stuck with it. Showcasing both the best and worst of humanity, Beartown is one of the best books I'll read in my lifetime. Obviously, I recommend!! :-)"

It‚Äôs a contemporary about ice hockey in a small town community, which I know nothing about, but this still somehow managed to break me apart and completely grip me heart and soul. I ended up caring so much for these characters and their lives that I felt every blow and every emotion with them - from rage, grief, despair and deep rooted love. Love for family, for hockey, and for a community isolated and desperate to keep up with the big cities. Backman‚Äôs writing is wonderful. So many times I went back and reread sentences because he managed to convey so much in a single sentence. Nothing is hidden either. We know the outcome of the story right from the opening sentence, but it‚Äôs the process of how we get there that packs the emotional punch. The plot itself is slow, (hence the no 5 stars) but it needs to be. For the first 150 pages we get an intense character study on the inhabitants of Beartown. We know what makes everyone tick, what are their darkest secrets and worst memories, and that makes the reader really deeply care for them and their stories. Everyone knows everyone‚Äôs business, they‚Äôve all played hockey together and shared in each other‚Äôs biggest life moments, and that‚Äôs what makes the heart of the story so shocking and believable. To believe one person over another, to see someone as a commodity and a lifeline, which gives them a ‚Äòfree pass‚Äô on life. It throws up so many important conversations and thoughts on human nature, it was incredible to read.Looking at the characters in more detail, we have the star hockey youth Kevin - the guy who has never been taught what it‚Äôs like to loose, always seeking perfection because that‚Äôs how life should be. He‚Äôs the guy who‚Äôs going to turn around the fortunes of Beartown‚Äôs hockey league, and bring in commerce and revenue to the town. Everyone has their hopes pinned on him. He can do no wrong, he has best friend Benji, a guy determined to ruin his own life by any means possible, watching his back. We also have Amat, the tender 15 year old who just wants to have a better life for him and his mother, the ice rink cleaner, by becoming the best. He idolises Kevin, and all his dreams come true when he‚Äôs asked to play in the youth semi finals game alongside him. And then there‚Äôs General Manager Peter and his family. A former hockey player himself, he‚Äôs determined the raise the club to new heights, and his passion for hockey brings his family into the world too. Something he‚Äôll live to regret. The love that each of these characters has for another is a running theme throughout the book, one that shows the power and strength love can give but also one that can be used to manipulate and abuse those who love us in return. An exceptional piece of work."

His books: A Man Called Ove, Anxious People, Your Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She‚Äôs Sorry, and Brit-Marie are filled with quirky yet likable characters, humor, and humanism. His lively writing style and insight into the human condition help me to laugh at life. In Beartown, Backman shifts gears and focuses on the ugly side of human nature. At times it is a painful read.Beartown is a small town in northern Sweden facing economic decline. It is a hockey town, and the powers that be determine that hockey is the key to its revival. If Beartown‚Äôs high school hockey team wins the finals, they believe that the town will become the site of a hockey school, which could spark new development in the area.Backman is adept at creating the ambiance of a small town enthralled with hockey. With a sardonic eye, he introduces the townspeople, the team manager, the coaches, the players, the parents, and their history with hockey. The story builds to the first playoff where Beartown wins. There is just one game to go. Then at the playoff victory party, the star player commits a rape. Backman‚Äôs realistic depiction of the town‚Äôs response is a gut-wrenching read."

182,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45941903-8stitches-9lives,Rating 5 out of 5,"Full to the brim with emotion, a beautiful book. My first by Fredrik Backman but certainly not my last. This isn't my usual go-to genre but this just caught my eye. I am so pleased I gave it a chance! Sometimes after a lot of thrillers, you need something in between or even alongside just to change the subject completely and wipe the slate clean a little. This book achieved it superbly. I'm thoroughly chuffed I decided to read this novel and I hope others do too. I have heard that this is a departure from Backman's usual topics but I would still love to give his other books a go, an author like this doesn't come around every day. They are already on my TBR list. I know that i've heard of a Man Called Ove before I discovered this book and I understand that it received very good reviews from critics - this will be my next read of his. I didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I did - for one, it's a book that revolves around Hockey and sport is not something that gets my attention at the best of times. Unless it is Tennis, of course. I would also like to note that I have the ARC version of this book entitled - The Scandal - the name it is known under in Canada and the United Kingdom. It is most commonly known as Beartown.Beartown is a snow-covered small-town in Sweden that emanstes with the kind of dark and cold that brings townsfolk together forming a tight knit rural community on the edge of civilisation. The isolation of the community means that they usually either come together - showing that anything is achievable when everyone supports one another or the polar opposite - where the people don't get closer but are pulled apart from one another instead. If they can all just pull together Beartown is on the edge of a revival, a bright new future is up ahead just for them. All of this hope for the future is then put in jeopardy by one brutal act. It divides the town into those who want the act to be kept quiet and never mentioned again and those who feel that they just can't stand by and let that happen. There are those who will risk their future in order to see justice done. It then falls to one young man to speak the truth that no one else wants to hear and find the courage to not just stay silent along with most of the rest. It's time for people to pick a side - you are either or one side or the other. Which side would you be on?You will be surprised how well a book about a Hockeytown actually makes you think about lifes big questions. Right vs wrong, morality, issues of individual loyalty. There are so many ideas in this book that lead you to think about everything in your own life. The characters are admirable and the storytelling masterful. Backman very cleverly lulls you into a false sense of security - you think you are reading something lighthearted or a pretty standard novel but quite soon you establish that his writing gift has made you think a lot more than you had realised! It takes a great author to pull this off.I would like to thank Fredrik Backman, Penguin (UK) - Michael Joseph & NetGalley for an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."

So here we are! almost everyone is asking themselves if it is actually possible. Living here any longer. Asking themselves if there‚Äôs anything left, apart from property values that seem to fall as rapidly as the temperature. * * * Then they wake up to the sound of a bang. And they smile.The book is not about a single person or two, its about a whole town! And that's one of the best things of this book. It shows how one action affects not just the life of another person but the whole community they live in. You can't do things without affecting everyone around you. It's about hockey just as much as it's about life. I have always found sports to be the best metaphor to represent life. The feelings playing a sport gives us, the training, the hard work, the emotions during a game, the wins, setbacks, and the feeling of being a part of something greater than yourself is the same things that represent life and that's why I always wish for a good sports book and this is there among the top..Hockey is a simple sport: when your desire to win is stronger than your fear of losing, you have a chance. No one wins when they‚Äôre frightened.‚ÄúThe only time I‚Äôm not moving forward is when I‚Äôm taking aim.‚ÄùAnd shall we talk about the writing. It was beautiful and magical. Short and simple sentences with depth of the ocean. You don't need difficult words to make a point. You just need to know how to arrange simple words in order to have the most effect.If you have solved Maths equations you know the format:To prove:Proof:Hence provedAll the chapters started with a simple sentence which was proved to be a statement by the end of that chapter.The only thing the sport gives us are moments.But what the hell is life, Peter, apart from moments?‚ÄùIt's about the importance of a game in the lives of people, an incident that will change the lives of all, force everyone to take sides, its about a boy who everyone said was born to win, about a girl who picked up weapons despite knowing she'll loose, about friendships, loyalties, parenting, truth, courage, ambitions, righteousness... It's about a town begging for better moments.Say what you like about Beartown, it can take your breath away.‚ÄúBeartown‚ÄîLeaves You Wanting More!‚Äù The wind and snow took a few years to wipe out the word ‚ÄúMore.‚ÄùBut I want that MORE¬°!!"

I wrote Backman off after Ove, gave him another shot and loved Anxious People, and when this one was recommended to me, I didn‚Äôt waste any time getting to it. Like Anxious People, this is a book about hockey, but it‚Äôs ultimately not about hockey. I didn‚Äôt bother reading much of the plot, so I thought it was mostly about hockey in a small town. I‚Äôm not a hockey fan at all. I‚Äôm much more into basketball and soccer these days, but you don‚Äôt have to love or know a damn thing about hockey to read Beartown. A lot more is going on here that I was not expecting. And it‚Äôs heavy, man. This book will smash you into pieces, attempt to glue you back together again, and then check you right into the boards over and over again. It‚Äôs a pretty long, sad, depressing ride, but it was all worth it in the end. Backman‚Äôs character development shines in this book, too. Everyone gets their air time, and even those most minor of characters gets their fifteen minutes of fame somewhere in the pages. The chapters bounce quickly between different storylines, characters, and/or perspectives, and that keeps you locked in the whole time. I found myself flying through the book, thinking about it when I wasn‚Äôt reading it, and taking every opportunity I could to sneak in a few more pages. I actually almost finished it on an airplane, and I was bummed that I had to get off the plane with about 15 pages left. I‚Äôll be thinking about Beartown for a long time. The town and its inhabitants are still bouncing around in my brain. It all feels so real and alive, like I was there for a week with all of the team, parents, and coaches. And I guess I‚Äôm gonna go back and visit them again soon. I feel like I need something a little lighter for now, something more comedic and fun, but I‚Äôll be back in Beartown again very soon. I‚Äôll read Us Against You, and then probably anything else by Backman. I love the way he tells a story, steps away to give you a few quotable lines, makes you think about life differently, goes back to the story, rips your heart out, puts it back in. I‚Äôm all in for all of that stuff. "

It's always regarded as a positive characteristic, because a lot of people would say that many of the best things people do for each other occur precisely because of loyalty. The only problem is that many of the very worst things we do to each other occur because of the same thing.""What a book! Everyone has been urging me to read Backman, but his books never really caught my attention...until now. Although a podcast practically revealed most of the major plot elements, I decided to read it anyway because this time I wanted to be able to discuss the summer book of 2017. And that's exactly what it is! Backman introduces us to a cast of characters from a small backwoods town in Sweden. The only thing going for this town, which is practically on the brink of extinction, is the local hockey club. From birth young boys are trained in the sport, and told to give it their all. To say that Beartown is enthusiastic about hockey is an understatment; it's the only thing they know how to do. When a tragedy threatens to divide the town, it's also an opportunity for people to show their true colors.I really enjoyed even the difficult parts of this book! Unlikely people become unsung heroes, and the town if full of bristly but loveable characters, which I'm told is a hallmark of Backman's work. Highly recommend, although you really don't need to read too many reviews before picking up a copy. Most will divulge key points that it's better to discover on your own. I will definitely be reading more of his work, probably in reverse order, too!"

I listened to the audio book of this one, and honestly, Marin Ireland is just superb and has an incredible way of narrating Backman's books that really connects with the story.I also did what I never do, which was watch the TV series of Beartown before reading the book. I can honestly say that other than making a few small changes, the series truly captured every meaningful part of this story. The series helped me see the mob mentality, the way that sports culture and its protective insular sheltering keep certain people from being held accountable for their actions. The book gave me insight into the characters and most of their thinking and motivation behind their actions. I definitely got more of a sense of the characters from the book than I did on the screen.Overall though, Backman's phrasing and way of writing totally connects with me and there is so much beauty and love among the broken people. Beartown is, it its core, a story of love. Friendship. Family. I never thought I would like a book about hockey, and that's part of the reason why I put off reading it for as long as I did. I have been to maybe two hockey games in my life and am not even sure about the rules. Yet this book has so many universal themes that I encourage reluctant readers to move past the hockey because this is about more than that. I'm moving on to the next book in the series to see how things continue and am interested to see that there's a third book slated for later this year."

The town doesn't really have anything else than ice hockey to talk about. Beartown has had a star hockey player, and is about to have one more in the near future. Thus in the initial chapters of the book, this will literally feel like a book based on sports without any much story apart from it.That's only till the semifinal match. Once the semis are won by the junior hockey team of Beartown, the story takes a turn and gets really interesting.Sexual abuse is not an easy topic to write a story about. But Backman handles it very well. Obviously the accusser is none other than the star player, thus the town is blind and eventually sees him as a victim. Well why won't they be blind, after all he's the star player of the town. He is the one who is about to turn around the fortune of the poor town.I feel bad for the victim, as she is treated as the accusser by the entire town. After being harassed sexually, she is harassed physically too by her school-mates. However she is not a coward. She takes on each challenge courageously, and is sometimes the one handling the sadness of her parents.Till the end, the town doesn't believes her. But once the exact description of the event is announced to the entire town by an alibi just before votings are done to kick-out the girl's father from the mangement of the hockey team, then the town silently supports her family. But the accusser's family is rich, and rich people find some way to save their ass. Talking about what I like about the book:- Mr. Backman, your writing is just amazing.- The character build up was just amazing. Not just Kevin, Maya, Benji, Amat or their family, but other characters like Jeanette, Ramona, Anna, Tails, Lyt, etc too had a justified ending.- Even though the ending wasn't on a happy note for the victim, the story was a complete one with a justified ending. The rich do get out of everything with money.- The accusser wasn't punished by the law, but the victim found a way to punish him so that he never regrets what he has done. Eager to read part 2 of the series."

Now, years later I finally had the courage to finish it.This book was hard for me.The author has a way with words, and the way he portrait the good but also the bad in human nature - broke my heart. I never want to read books that picture how horrible we humans can be towards each other. Seeing it in the news is all I can bare - I don't usually want to read about it as well. But I wanted to read Us Against You and I felt like I had to finish Beartown first.I've loved this author's writing for years now, especially after OVE and¬†My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She‚Äôs Sorry¬†I was hooked, but nothing could have prepared me for the onslaught of feelings this book brought forth.This story is one that will make you believe in mankind and also hate it. It will make you think, feel and tear up. It truly put me through the wringer. There was a reason why I didn't finish the book the first time around. But the beautiful writing, the underlying message and the ever present glimpse of hope was worth it in the end.I still stand to my rating from 2017, even though the book was beautifully written, the topic was just too raw for me. I didn't really enjoy it as much as I hoped, even if I couldn't put it down the second time around. The story was just too dark and heart-breaking for me.But there is a reason why readers love this book. And I would certainly recommend it to anyone who loves to read beautiful and meaningful fiction, and who has a thicker skin than I do.

Still there is one thing that keeps Beartown alive and that is hockey. The junior hockey team made it all the way to the championship semi-finals and they actually have a chance. Everyone, from the coaches to the locals, are putting all their faith on the team. When struck by a quite lamentable event, the town pick sides and begins to grow apart. Its about hockey and so much more.Fredrik Backman is not a one trick pony! For those familiar with his work, you will not find the likes of Ove, Granny or Britt-Marie on these pages. The wit and humour that usually characterize his prose are absent here. What you will find, however, is the same skill (of Backman) to construct characters that stay with you long after you turn the last page. Beartown is primarily about hockey but it would be a big mistake to assume that its just about the sport. One does not have to like hockey to enjoy this book (personally I like soccer but the overall sentiment is the same). Being of a more serious and solemn tone, this novel is powerful and poignant. Dealing with loyalty, courage and a deep sense of both, wanting and to belong this novel explores the human spirit and its limits. Experiencing a heartfelt elation to a deep anger, this book was an emotional ride. The gamut of emotions that Backman exposes the reader to is certainly wide, this is his true trademark. I was rooting for (most) of these characters on and off the ice, particularly Sune and Amat. What else can I say? I love this author and can not wait for his next book. Highly recommended."

This is my first book from Fredrick Bachman, and it certainly won't be my last. This is an incredibly powerful story about a small town in Sweden called ""Beartown"" and this town thinks hockey is the most important thing in the world. This is a story about family and community and love, but also heartache and tragedy, and I'm just blown away by how deep this book got. There are trigger warnings for: rape which I wasn't really expecting from a book like this. This book is extremely feminist and has so many amazing feminist messages and quotes throughout this book. It also talks a lot about how the world always blames the victim in a terrible situation. Those messages in this book were so powerful for me, I loved it. ‚ÄúWhat an uncomfortable, terrible source of shame it is for the world that the victim is so often the one left with the most empathy for others.‚Äù It was just so important and amazing to see the feminism in this book, especially with Kiera and her job as a lawyer, and how she felt like she could never be ""one of the guys"" at her job because she is a Mother, and yet people expect her to be exceptional at both. I also love how it said in this town girls can't like hockey because ""if they like the game they're a lesbian and if they like the players they're a slut."" I'm a huge fan of hockey and I'm a girl so I completely agree that girls should be allowed to love hockey and not be judged for it, or be called a slut or a lesbian for it. I loved all the quotes about motherhood, and anxiety and the psychology behind it, it was all very thought provoking. ‚ÄúShe is told all the things she shouldn‚Äôt have done: She shouldn‚Äôt have waited so long before going to the police. She shouldn‚Äôt have gotten rid of the clothes she was wearing. Shouldn‚Äôt have showered. Shouldn‚Äôt have drunk alcohol. Shouldn‚Äôt have put herself in that situation. Shouldn‚Äôt have gone into the room, up the stairs, given him the impression. If only she hadn‚Äôt existed, then none of this would have happened, why didn‚Äôt she think of that?‚ÄùThis book also has this overall moral question of: how far would you go to protect your child? which is always a very interesting thing to read about. When parents of a rapist are put into question about what they know and who they raised... It's all very intense and heart breaking. ‚ÄúAll adults have days when we feel completely drained. When we no longer know quite what we spend so much time fighting for, when reality and everyday worries overwhelm us and we wonder how much longer we‚Äôre going to be able to carry on. The wonderful thing is that we can all live through far more days like that without breaking than we think. The terrible thing is that we never know exactly how many.‚Äù I adore Kiera and Peter's relationship, her being a lawyer and a Mother and him being the coach of the hockey team. I enjoyed the way they talked about marriage and bickered back and forth, but you could tell they really loved each other. Their scenes definitely made me cry a few times whenever they mentioned their daughter that died as a baby of heart disease. ‚ÄúHate can be a deeply stimulating emotion. The world becomes easier to understand and much less terrifying if you divide everything and everyone into friends and enemies, we and they, good and evil. The easiest way to unite a group isn't through love, because love is hard, It makes demands. Hate is simple. So the first thing that happens in a conflict is that we choose a side, because that's easier than trying to hold two thoughts in our heads at the same time. The second thing that happens is that we seek out facts that confirm what we want to believe - comforting facts, ones that permit life to go on as normal. The third is that we dehumanize our enemy.‚ÄùThis book is gorgeously written, and very thought provoking and starts a very important conversation in regard to feminism and rape culture. I really enjoyed this book and I think it's something everyone should read. (Also I highly recommend listening to the audiobook - it's fantastic!) "
196,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5953660-malia,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is my fourth book by Fredrik Backman, and I am happy to report it lived up to my high expectations. Though, as is typical with his books, I was initially skeptical I would like it. The book, on its surface, appears to be about a hockey-obsessed little town, and frankly few things interest me less than hockey. I should have known that nothing is quite as it first seems in a Backman novel. Beartown is about hockey, yes, but it's really about community, friendship, family, betrayal, love, disappointment, and so much more. His novels are all vastly multi-dimensional and typically more than a little melancholy, but they also feel very real. They are essentially about normal people and their troubles which can feel so huge and seem so insurmountable, even if, from the outside, they don't appear that big a deal. Backman has a way of exploring what lies beneath the surface of people from all walks of life. Nothing in his books is ever black and white. They are not the easiest reads, because they force you to think and maybe even challenge opinions you once held as given. The cast of characters in Beartown is large, but vivid and beautifully developed. The setting is at times bleak, but chillingly atmospheric. The story moves slowly, then startles with a jolting event, and the tempo changes almost with the quality of a song. Everything in Backman's books seems intentional and well thought out, and at the same time completely inevitable. Big events happen, shocking and troubling, and still they didn't feel forced or overly dramatic. This book, in particular, feels very timely in light of the many emerging stories of sexual assault, though I suppose it always, sadly, was a timely issue. It considers the shame forced on victims of assault, and the horrible reality that they are so often doubted when they find the courage to speak.Backman's are the types of stories that linger with you, or at least with me, long after I have read them. There aren't that many books that leave a lasting impression when you read well over 100 books a year, so this is saying something.If I haven't made it clear enough by now, and you re still reading, I really, truly, very much recommend Fredrik Backman's books, Beartown and the others, too.Find more reviews and bookish fun at http://www.princessandpen.com"

As businesses leave for greener pasture the population diminishes. There is next to nothing that locals can take pride in except, that is, the local Junior Ice Hockey team. By some miraculous occurrence the junior team has a couple of exceptional players and with them as the flag bearers the team has made it to the national finals. Suddenly the populous have straighter backs and there‚Äôs a buzz around the town that‚Äôs been missing for years. To win the national finals would give the town a lot more than just pride. Sponsors would want to invest in the team, everybody loves a winner. Businesses would be coming to Beartown rather than leaving it. People can see money everywhere so the pressure on the boys to succeed is enormous. Beartown has come alive, people have their tails up and God is in his heaven shinning his benevolence down on them.That was until the 15 year old daughter of the teams‚Äô general manager accuses one of the superstars of raping her. All hell breaks loose. How dare this spoiled little vixen burst their bubble?This revelation will turn the honest, hard working locals of Beartown into a vicious, vindictive pack. 75% of the locals just want the problem to go away, she‚Äôs young and she‚Äôll get over it, and anyway there‚Äôs a game to be won. The other 25%, if not vengeance, what they want, at the very least, is justice. The emotional trauma that the young girl at the centre of all this hatred goes through will have you wanting to step into the pages and rough up a few of the fine upstanding locals.This is a fantastic, emotional rollercoaster of a ride and I can‚Äôt recommend it highly enough"

But oh boy, was this book about hockey good! I've never read Backman before but I'm on a mission to read all of his other books. 5 well deserved stars!"
199,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34117027-olivia-savannah,Rating 5 out of 5,"It took me thirty pages of this book to know it was going to be a new favourite and one of the best books I read in 2020.I was anxious before reading this book because I knew it had a lot to do with ice hockey and I know absolutely nothing about that. But don‚Äôt worry. After the first few pages you understand why ice hockey is so important to the town and you‚Äôll probably end up caring about the sport as much as I did when reading.Backman is the master of writing such realistic characters. He balances so many of them, but each one is fully fleshed out and so believable I wouldn‚Äôt do a double take if I met them on the street. We get to see what each person is passionate about, what drives them and therefore can‚Äôt help understanding them.The small town setting was done incredibly well. Everyone knows everyone, and everyone gets caught up in what the town finds important at the time. And it is set in the middle of winter in an ice hockey town. The setting is so seamlessly woven into the story that I couldn‚Äôt help but shiver while reading.In terms of the sports, it really did talk about the positives and the negatives of sports culture. A team is truly a found family, and you get that feeling from reading this one. But it also shows how just like in families, there can be problems and secrets and fractured moments too. It also talked about how in the sports industry you dedicate your life to the sport and it becomes you all ‚Äì sometimes eclipsing other things you should care about in life too. It becomes your escape, your future, your career‚Ä¶ so much that you don‚Äôt know what to do without it. That can be a beautiful thing, but it can be dangerous too.It also talks about the toxicity in sports culture too. And there is a lot of that. What happens to those disregard, injured, pushed too hard too soon as young players, seeing people as products, players granted too much free reign in life so they don‚Äôt learn discipline and respect, overlooking problematic behaviour, feminism in sports, LGBT+ rights in sports, race in sports‚Ä¶ it almost feels impossible to think a book can have a time to touch on all of those themes and do it well, but the book truly does.The relationships in this book were so important. The motherhood feels and discussions with Kira were some I appreciated so much. I loved seeing Ana and Maya, and the exploration of how friendships change and morph as you grow older. Amat and Zaccharias‚Äô characters also reflected that, but in a different way. Kevin and Benji too, although that friendship relationship got even more complex for several reasons. And then last but not least, Amat and Bobo as well. Bobo‚Äôs development over the course of the novel was my favourite thing. In fact, let me take a moment to mention my favourite characters: Benji, Bobo and Amat in that order. Oh, and I adored Leo so much too.And there can be no ignoring the main focus of this novel. I know some people find the main theme to be a spoiler, even though I think it shouldn‚Äôt be. I have it in my content warnings in this original version of the review (goodreads click link below to go to blog review) if you want to know ahead of time. What I love about how this novel is written is that it shows the escalation of the issue. How it starts with comments and jokes and becomes more. How the ignorance of the truth, the simplifying, the dehumanisation, the choosing of sides, how the victim is treated‚Ä¶ all of that adds up. The disparaging difference between how both sides were treated underlines the issues with how this topic gets handled and approached today. I liked the small details such as a particular point of view vanishing once it was no longer deserved, and how the novel no longer focused on them. When reading this, I felt sadness, anger, frustration, shame and everything else. It was an emotional onslaught all the way through and I couldn‚Äôt take a breath until I finished the book. But there was hope in the novel too, strangely, which I didn‚Äôt expect. And appreciated.I am always one to love imagery or repetition in novels ‚Äì I think it can be such a powerful literary device. In this novel there is the repetition of silence. But there are some characters who understand the silence and others who don‚Äôt ‚Äì and whether they do or don‚Äôt is very telling of their character.All in all, this is the kind of book that shows you everything beautiful ‚Äì flawed but beautiful ‚Äì and rips it all away to reveal the truth. Read it now.This review and others can originally be found on Olivia's Catastrophe: https://oliviascatastrophe.com/2021/0..."
200,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18983476-bill,Rating 5 out of 5,"5.0 StarsExtraordinary! Outstanding! Magnificent! One of the best books I've read in a very long time.When I finished Beartown, I paused to reflect, took in a deep inhalation that rushed over my lips and tongue, flowing all the way into the depths at the very bottom of my lungs, filling every cell of my body with the living, breathing, emotional river that rushes out of these pages. I blink away the moisture that puddles in my eyes, sniff back the tears that escape into nasal passages and slide down the back of my throat. I‚Äôm quieted in contemplation, enveloped in the humming vibration of feelings. It feels really good!While the story revolves around the Beartown Ice Hockey Club, the only thing left to cheer for in the small town nestled in the forest, suffering steady economic decline, no knowledge of hockey is necessary to understand and FEEL this book. This book is alive, a full range of human emotions on display and converted into the full force of electric, mesmerizing kinetic energy emanating from each and every page.Winning the championship game would put Beartown on the map; a new hockey academy and rebounding economic prosperity. After the semifinal win, Beartown in jubilant! But the post-game activities of the junior team, inspired by alcohol and male bravado fostered by the coaching staff, spills out of the hockey culture bubble, escaping into the real world of politics, class and social upheaval. Everyone in Beartown is influenced; even those with no interest in the game. Everyone is tangentially connected to hockey simply by their presence in Beartown. It‚Äôs his word against hers. Neighbors and friends take sides; parents prepare for battle. Relationships are tested and challenged. Best friendships are disintegrated and reassembled in completely different forms, some for better, some for much worse. Mothers and fathers discover new, more passionate ways to love their children, to defend them.As news spreads across Beartown, best friends bond more tightly and grow stronger; others splinter like shattered glass. Closely held secrets and long held beliefs and assumptions are exposed and confronted, often times validated with a selective accumulation of facts. Culture, Values and Community, the motto of the Beartown Ice Hockey Club, is vague enough to have meaning for everyone and anyone but specific enough to inspire long time members to question the very existence of the team.‚Äú‚Ä¶the club had an unpleasant culture of silence,‚Äù Kira once told him. ‚ÄúThe sort of thing you find among soldiers and criminals.‚ÄùBackman‚Äôs writing style and delivery is astounding, adeptly and skillfully exploring friendship and loyalty when they smash head on with morality, right and wrong, good and evil. Love in Beartown can be tough and unyielding and in the end, the unyielding love and extraordinary strength of a fifteen year old girl saves her parents along with many of the adults in Beartown from misery and despair, loneliness and bitterness, hatred and jealousy.  At book‚Äôs end, my only disappointment was the very last page meant I was forced to say good-bye to all the people of Beartown. I‚Äôll miss you the most Maya Anderssen. You are a remarkbale human being. Benji Ovich, you are stronger than you can ever imagine. Amat, you are an angel! ‚ÄúCherry trees always smell of cherry trees."" Stop what you are doing right now and read Beartown!"
201,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5512657-sara,Rating 4 out of 5,"Small towns are not like big cities. If you have ever lived in one, you know that while you can hide in a big city and be anonymous, that is not going to be very easy in a small town. On the flip side, you are a part of something in a small town and you share something with every other inhabitant, for good or bad that town is you and you are that town. Some people want to escape and others want to never leave, but there are limited ways out and never leaving can mean withering on the vine.The small town that is Beartown, Sweden is a hockey town. They have built their lives around hockey. Anything that threatens the hockey club threatens the town itself, again for good or for bad, for it is the center around which everything else orbits. So, introduce a moral dilemma, you must do what is right or you must do what is right for the club, which is to say the town. If you go against the club, you go against the money, the power, the prestige and the economic base, and the world as you know it might just collapse on your head. I was not enthralled by this book for the first third. It was too much about teenagers and teenage problems. It was too much about sports which are of little or no interest to me, and hockey which I confess to not even truly understand. But it was flowing easily along and I could drift with it pretty effortlessly. Then an event takes place that sets everything on its ears, and I reversed my view of the book almost immediately. It became about something much more meaningful, much more universal, and something that can affect anyone regardless of age.My hat is off to Backman for creating both realistic characters, realistic situations, and realistic reactions. I wanted to scream at some of these people, but then I want to scream at a lot of people in real life. I wanted to soothe and cuddle others and, again, we know those people who just seem to need a pat on the back or a word of encouragement and don‚Äôt ever get it.I have A Man Called Ove on my physical TBR shelf. It just moved up the ladder."
202,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27298436-toni,Rating 5 out of 5,"Every time I try to write my review for this incredible book, I write four plus pages; that's unacceptable. Backman writes about us, people, parents, kids, in a struggling town anywhere in the world. The location doesn't matter really. Everyone is trying to live everyday as best as they can, provide for their families maybe a little better than they had it during their childhood. You'll recognize yourself and your neighbors. The town's identity is its sport, in this case hockey, but it could be any sport. It encompasses everyone's life. Some kids are better than others, all are taught that the TEAM comes before anything or anyone. The team includes kids from all over town, some privileged, some poor, mixed ethnicities, all encompassing.However, an incident occurs that will test everyone's loyalties. People will take sides. The characters are so complex, so deep, so incredible. There are at least ten quotes I could place here. How could Fredrik Backman be so knowledgeable about people, especially teenagers. The primary refrain throughout is, ""we can't protect our children."" That is very true, we think we can, but we can't. All we can do is teach them right from wrong. They grow up and we can't be with them all the time, they'll have to make their own decisions. So profound for our world right now. Please read this book, it will matter, to all of us.Oh my goodness!!! I have no words to explain the wonder of this book. This book is very different from Backman's previous books. Amazing. An additional 5 stars to Backman's translator; you are the best on the planet. Congratulations. Bravo.Thank you Netgalley, Atria Books, and Simon and Schuster."
203,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5328952-antoinette,Rating 5 out of 5,"I loved this book about a small town whose main driving factor is hockey.""It's only a game. Everyone who plays it gets told that from time to time. A lot of people try to tell themselves that it's true But it's complete nonsense. No one in this town would have been the same if that game hadn't existed.""Hockey is so important to the town of Beartown, that when one of its elite players does something so egregious, the town is torn apart. We know from the description that something bad occurs. I kept reading with a feeling of dread, waiting for the ""event"" and the fall out. When it occurred and the reaction it elicited from the whole town was so emotionally devastating.The author captures the players, the parents, the coaches and some of the townspeople who are impacted by this game of hockey. Backman knows how to create unique characters-flawed, quirky, believable people!He brings the world of hockey to life- the fanatical parents; the politics surrounding hockey; the driving force in these young players; the win at all cost attitude.Loyalty means a lot to team players- are you to remain loyal at all costs? Is being part of a team more important than being honest and moral? The ending was strong- it totally satisfied me. I was mesmerized by this book. Bravo to the author!My thanks to Netgalley and Simon and Schuster and the author Fredrik Backman for the privilege of reading this book in exchange for an honest review."
204,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6181069-ingrid,Rating 5 out of 5,"I find it very difficult to rate this book as it was like a wrestling match for me. I loved it and I didn't like it at all. A few times during the first 100 pages I wanted to stop and find something better to read. I couldn't get past the 1 star then. How much hockey can someone who doesn't like sports much, take? But the build-up of the story had me hooked so I needed to read on. And on... and on.... It was so drawn out that my rating plummeted back down again. But I read on till the end and I thought this book was as fantastic as it was horrible. So there you go, I've chosen for 5 stars but don't ask me why exactly."
205,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4886576-cody,Rating 5 out of 5,"""Community is the fact that we work toward the same goal, that we accept our respective roles in order to reach it. Values is the fact that we trust each other. That we love each other. David thought about that for a long while before asking: What about culture then? Sune looked more serious, choosing his words carefully. In the end he said: For me, culture is a much about what we encourage as what we actually permit. David asked what he meant by that, and Sune replied: That most people don't do what we tell them to. They do what we let them get away with."" (210) ""Hate can be a deeply stimulating emotion. The world becomes much easier to understand and much less terrifying if you divide everything and everyone into friends and enemies, we and they, good and evil. The easiest way to unite a group isn't through love, because love is hard. It makes demands. Hate is simple. So the first thing that happens in a conflict is that we choose a side, because that's easier than trying to hold two thoughts in our heads at the same time. The second thing that happens is that we seek out facts that confirm what we want to believe- comforting facts, ones that permit life to go on as normal. The third is that we dehumanise our enemy. There are many ways of doing that, but none is easier than taking her name away from her"" (273)Simply put, Beartown is a phenomenal work of art. Its focus is timely, its cast of characters brilliant, and the book's overall story is hauntingly memorable. This was my first book by Fredrik Backman, and now I'm eagerly curious to see if his other works match up to this literary gem. When the book starts, we catch glimpses of hope from the tiny community of Beartown and its inhabitants as they stake their future on the success of their local youth hockey team. Hockey is everything to this town, as it symbolizes the one glimmer of hope and escape from a community facing harsh economic stagnation and even harsher bitter cold. As the team pushes forward and the community rallies around them, a horrifying turn of fate presents itself that threatens to divide and enrage Beartown, challenging the prospects of hope it so desperately is fighting for.As stated, Beartown has an outstanding cast. Every character feels fleshed out and important to the story and to Beartown itself. That is the central pillar to Beartown making it stand tall and proud among contemporary literary works. I enjoyed discovering what made each one of the characters tick. There's Peter and Kira, the pound parents who fight to give their children love, opportunity and protection. There's Bobo, a loveable giant who's appearance doesn't match his innocent nature. There's Amat, a refugee from a war-torn country he never knew fighting for a place on the hockey team and in Beartown itself. There's Ramona, the local fiery barkeep and a dozen others with interesting backstories. My personal favourite was Benji though, an insightful young man on the hockey team who one character subtly refers to as the ""bravest bastard I know."" While I realize Beartown is a fictionalized town, in the back of my mind I've concluded I believe it really exists among the wilds of Northern Sweden. And coming to that realisation reminds me of the power of storytelling and the believability of it can have over an audience."

1st reread September 2020
The emotions. The critique. The understanding. The love. The hate. While I was too angry and hurt because of the unfairness and injustice of it all the first time around, I could see more clearly this time and could pick up a lot of the finer details I've missed a few months ago. And that made me appreciate this book and the execution of the story even more. The topic is such a hard one to write about but Backman does it in such an incredibly honest way - without ever becoming preachy or having the feeling he imposes a certain view on the reader. And still he shows so very clearly how this is a bitter reality and how people rather turn their heads and blame the victim instead of acknowledging the problem and their own mistakes - and that may be the hardest punch delivered by this book. ---------
Original review
I've tried countless times to put my thoughts and feelings about Beartown into words. But I can't. And I don't think I ever will. This book is too complex, too real, too emotional, too human, too raw and takes up a way too big part of my heart. It made me feel everything in an intensity I never thought a book could make me feel. Fredrik Backman captures the essence of what it means to be human in this story in a way I could never explain accurately. This story is a masterpiece and no one - no one - can convince me otherwise."
207,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13036247-diana,Rating 5 out of 5,"The opening sentence in Beartown reads: ""Late one evening toward the end of March, a teenager picked up a double-barreled shotgun, walked into the forest, put the gun to someone else's forehead, and pulled the trigger.""Then Backman takes us back to early March and tells us everything leading up to this event. Along the way, he tells us so much more. The story revolves around a hockey team in a hockey town. I personally love hockey but I don't think you need to be a hockey fan to enjoy this book. There a lot of characters introduced in the beginning but once you get all the characters straight it becomes a book about so many things. Friendship, parenthood, disappointment, loyalty, acceptance, just to name a few. This novel took me through many different emotions. The writing is full of memorable quotes like:""Being a parent makes you feel like a blanket that's always too small. No matter how hard you try to cover everyone, there's always someone who's freezing."" ""Another morning comes. It always does. Time always moves at the same rate, only feelings have different speeds. Every day can mark a whole lifetime or a single heartbeat, depending on who you spend it with.""This was my first book by Backman but it will definitely not be my last. "

This is not a typical Backman novel. It will not leave you smiling from ear to ear. You won't get the warm and fuzzies either.What you will get is a story about a small town and their love for a sport played on the ice. Character development is just as beautiful as always. The message is just as loud and clear.Backman made me thoroughly enjoy a book that circles a town‚Äôs love of Hockey. Do I love hockey? I may now.

211,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53495766-paul-lockman,Rating 4 out of 5,"After reading Beartown I just had to search online to find out how old Fredrik Backman is ‚Äì he was born in 1981 so he‚Äôs only in his mid-30s. How can it be that a person in his mid-30s has so much wisdom and life experience? Honestly I reckon he could pass for a 2,000 year old Greek philosopher. Pearls of wisdom are sprinkled throughout the entire book. A couple of examples:David, on the other hand, sits alone and silent at the front, staring at the text on his own phone. It‚Äôs from Kevin‚Äôs dad. He‚Äôs just found out what his son is accused of. One of the first things you learn as a leader, whether you choose the position or have it forced upon you, is that leadership is as much about what you don‚Äôt say as what you do say.The 'scandal' has erupted and divided the town...Hate can be a deeply stimulating emotion. The world becomes much easier to understand and much less terrifying if you divide everything and everyone into friends and enemies, we and they, good and evil. The easiest way to unite a group isn‚Äôt through love, because love is hard. It makes demands. Hate is simple.So the first thing that happens in a conflict is that we choose a side, because that‚Äôs easier than trying to hold two thoughts in our heads at the same time. The second thing that happens is that we seek out facts that confirm what we want to believe ‚Äì comforting facts, ones that permit life to go on as usual. The third is that we dehumanize our enemy. There are many ways of doing that, but none is easier than taking her name away from her.Kira and Peter, Maya‚Äôs parents, suffered the tragic loss of their son several years prior and one day they‚Äôre feeling happy‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Everyone has a thousand wishes before a tragedy, but just one afterwards. When a child is born, its parents dream of it being as unique as possible, until it gets ill, when suddenly all they want is for everything to be normal. Foe several years after Isak died, Kira and Peter felt a terrible, lacerating guilt every time they laughed. Shame can still catch them when they feel happy, making them wonder if it‚Äôs a betrayal of their child that they disintegrate entirely when he left them. One of all the terrible effects of grief is that we interpret its absence as egotism. It‚Äôs impossible to explain what you have to do in order to carry on after a funeral, how to put pieces of a family back together again, how to live with the jagged edges. So what do you end up asking for? You ask for a good day. One single good day. A few hours of amnesia.There are so many themes that are skilfully developed and explored in the book ‚Äì living in a small town and all the dynamics that goes with that, team sports, loyalty, the pack mentality, social class and they haves and the have nots, the wealthy family that thinks they can buy whatever they like, being a parent and raising kids, especially adolescents ‚Äì to name a few. And of course there‚Äôs the ‚Äòscandal‚Äô, 15 year old Maya‚Äôs courageous accusation against Kevin, the best player in the hockey team who is the son of the wealthy businessman and the way it divides the community.Don‚Äôt be too concerned if you‚Äôre not into hockey or sport generally, this is a great read in my opinion and I give it 4.5 stars. I would have given it 5 for sure but I just took a while to get into it and initially reacted a little negatively to the way the narrative shifted quickly, a paragraph about one character, two pages about another, three paragraphs about a third person, back to the first character with another page etc. But this is a very minor criticism. I strongly recommend this book."

‚ÄúBitterness can be corrosive. It can rewrite your memories as if it were scrubbing a crime scene clean, until in the end you only remember what suits you of its causes.‚Äù‚ÄúAll your best qualities come from the fact that you‚Äôve been raised in a house full of women.‚Äù
TW: Body image, child mortality (flashback), guns, homophobia, rape, rape culture, suicide (mentions), suicidal thoughts, victim blaming, violenceBeartown is a slap in the face.Well, if I am being totally honest, I was way more impressed with the writing than the actual plot, but what would be the plot without the words shaping it? So, there is a correlation between the two and now that I‚Äôve wasted a few lines to say nothing in the end, I should start talking about the book.Let me start by saying: Beartown wasn‚Äôt about what I expected it to be about. If you‚Äôve read the book, you know what I mean, but if you haven‚Äôt, I would recommend not having any expectations. That being said, it was a breath-taking turn of events, the consequences still resonating in my head as this is a subject I am very sensitive about. The characterisation is strong and well developed, I found myself switching sides as I read the book and as each personality was explored further. The character range offers a wider vision of a society we are all part of, Beartown is only a sample of communities present around the world. We all know a local bar owner who knows the habits of a town‚Äôs inhabitants, we all know a kid with a secret, we all know a protective father, etc. Because of the book‚Äôs structure, I was inevitably carried into the eventful spiral following the tragedy. I absolutely loved the quickness in change of point of view and narrative ‚Äì the unforeseen consequences of a fast-paced environment mirroring the speediness of a hockey match, its strategies and its outcome. Just like the characters, the atmosphere suddenly takes a darker turn, which emphasises the seriousness of the book. I was far from knowing how heavy and serious Beartown was going to be.I have to insist on how beautiful the prose is. I also need to reiterate that Beartown was translated from Swedish and that the mere fact that the prose in English is stunning, makes me imagine how amazing the original work must be.A beautiful and emotional read, where right and wrong are interestingly intricated to a compelling plot. I found myself taking sides but also questioning the thoughts and ideas of every character ‚Äì controversially, each individual exposes their reasoning and their interest, and the simple fact of acknowledging and reckoning of the tragedy seems to be something unsurmountable. The different impacts and effects among the community were really well presented and it added more depth to the intrigue. Fredrik Backman is an amazing and skilful writer, and I will be reading more of his works."
214,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/202724-jessica,Rating 5 out of 5,"I have read every single one of Fredrik Backman's books. And I have loved every single one of his books. So when I tell you that this, right here, is his masterpiece, you need to listen to me. If you do not read any of his other books, read this one. If he never writes another book, it will not matter. What matters is that he wrote this book, and everyone should read it. Everyone. This is completely different from his darkly comic, quirky stories. Oh, there's quirks here, but it's the quirkiness of real people, with all our flaws and our rituals, the things that make us laugh and cry, our likes and dislikes. Backman's strength, as always, lies in his characters, who are always so heartbreakingly real and never more so than here. I don't want to say anything else about the plot. I don't want to give anything away. On the surface it's a book about hockey, but it doesn't matter if you don't know a thing about the sport. It's also a story about families, and friends, about politics and economics. About the interconnectedness of everything, especially in a small town. It's a story about truth and lies, bravery and cowardice . . . it's just one hell of a story, perfectly written.It's a masterpiece."

It tells the story of advert family, from the sponsors, to the high school kids to the cleaners and all the richer and poor in between.With life on and off the ice; the difference between morality and justice is explored and how every individual processes one single event from every perspective in a small town completely reliant on the bloodline and legacy of ice hockey.

218,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45796209-bkwmlee,Rating 5 out of 5,"Once again, I am rendered speechless by a Fredrik Backman book! The man definitely has a way of telling a story that is so utterly compelling that, every time I read one of his books, I find it nearly impossible to tear myself away (which is why I‚Äôm glad I started this on a weekend so I could spend all day reading if I needed to). Before I go further, I need to make a confession: I‚Äôve never been into sports and under normal circumstances, I probably would not have gravitated toward a book about hockey. But as nearly everyone who has read and reviewed this book mentioned, this is more than just a novel about hockey (or, more accurately, about a small town in the forest that is obsessed with hockey). In fact, this book blew me away with the wide range of themes it explored, which ran the gamut from parent/child relationships, to identity, belonging, class conflict, society bias, love, friendship, loyalty, the difference between right and wrong, etc. Beyond all that though, this is also a richly rendered character study about ordinary people living their lives and struggling with real life issues such as loneliness, abandonment, death, abuse, bullying, financial hardship, circumstances outside our control, etc. These are characters that we can absolutely relate to because they are flawed and realistic ‚Äî characters that make us feel the entire spectrum of human emotion and then some. Backman is a masterful storyteller with a unique writing style that I absolutely love ‚Äî a combination of serious and slightly humorous, yet also gut-wrenching and emotional. I‚Äôve been told that it‚Äôs nearly impossible to come away from a Backman novel without feeling something (whether positive, negative, or indifferent) for the characters and I have to say that I absolutely agree! That was definitely the case with every single character in this story. In fact, by the end of the book, I was so emotionally invested in these characters that I didn‚Äôt want to leave them ‚Äî which is why I intend to pick up the sequel, 
Us Against You
, right after this one so I can stay with the characters longer (and yes, I am eagerly looking forward to the final book in this series, which is scheduled to be published here in the U.S. in September)."
219,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27709782-canadian-jen,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is a story of a small town with a big heart for hockey. Hockey. My least favourite sport even though both my son and daughter played it for many years. I don't miss those early mornings or stinky hockey bags. Most of all I don't miss the subculture that exists. The mom's screaming squad, the aggression and violence, their own set of rules. The parents fighting over calls. Over a game. A game with a stick and a puck. I'm not even sure I wanted to read this if not for the glowing reviews from my GR friends.'Hockey is life' as my husband's tshirt says and this is true for Bear Town. Even though the premise of this story is very much about the sport, it's also about the values instilled in the game and team. It's about the passion, the relationships, the successes, the loneliness, the failures. It's about mistakes and the consequences. It's about a tragedy that takes place and the heart of the town is left divided.Backman you are a talent. The writing, brilliant. The various perspectives, the emotions and backend stories make this so real. Maybe because I lived pieces of it and learned to tolerate it; but, it's more likely because you are a master storyteller and this story scores 5*****"

I was initially hesitant because of the subject it deals with, but then I sampled the audiobook and it was so good that I just kept listening. This is a very emotional and complex story. Although it revolves around hockey, it also explores many different topics such as parenthood, friendship, abuse, loyalty, courage, justice, peer pressure, what it means to be a part of the community, and so many more.I absolutely loved the writing style. The story is told from many different POVs, I'd say as many as there are characters in the book, but each character was so distinct and well-developed that I never felt lost. They grabbed me right from the start and I loved learning about their lives and having an insight into their thoughts and feelings. I loved the audiobook. I think that Marin Ireland did a fantastic job narrating this story. It was so easy to follow and listen to."
221,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5922426-bam-cooks-the-books--,Rating 5 out of 5,"Do sports build character or reveal it? In Fredrik Beckman's new book, the game of hockey does both. Beartown is a small city, dying away in the cold, dark forests of Sweden, that lives and breathes for hockey. As the book begins, Beartown's hopes for fame and glory (and perhaps a civic resurgence as well) are pinned on the ice hockey club's junior team winning the last two games in the biggest youth tournament in the country. But one unspeakable act will disrupt their plans and divide the city. Which should come first? Loyalty to the club, and by extension, the entire city...or justice? The book actually begins with a foreshadowing of one teen's way of finding justice. Keep that in mind as you read the rest of the story. The first 40% of the book is all about hockey. Almost everyone in Beartown is obsessed with it--the children, their parents, their coaches, the middle-aged former players, the wealthy sponsors. But notice, hockey is only for boys. Unlike the neighboring city of Hed, Beartown does not have a girls' hockey team. Girls aren't allowed. Girls aren't supposed to love hockey, after all. If they do, they must be lesbians. And if they like the players, they are groupies and sluts. Girls, therefore, don't count in Beartown--they are merely a distraction.To be sure, several of the hockey players have been inspired to work harder and harder to develop their talents and make the team, and in them, one could say that character has been built by their efforts. In others, who were given great talent and excel without much effort, who were admired and pampered all their lives, one could say character is revealed by their actions. And in between are those who maybe didn't try hard enough or just don't have what it takes. Not everyone is good enough to play hockey at the higher levels. The training process shakes out the chaff. One such player is mercilessly bullied by the older boys--""he knows firsthand what the strong do to the weak in this town."" One cannot help but wonder, Who took the 'fun' out of the game of hockey?The characters in this story are AMAZING! Strong, strong women (thank you, Fredrik Backman!) Men who are manly enough to allow themselves to be weak and emotional at times. There are great bonds of friendship. The author is fond of saying, ""Never again do you have the sort of friends you have when you're fifteen."" But those bonds of friendship are sorely tested as they experience life. Loyalty is also a big theme. Which comes first: loyalty to your team or to your friend? Is loyalty more important than doing what is right?This book is wonderful at times and disturbing at others. Twice I had to put it down and walk away--so you know how emotionally involved I was at that moment. I highly recommend this book to fans of Backman's other books: you will find he has a stepped up to a new level in his writing with this one. You won't find the charming, warm and fuzzy story here. This one makes you stop and think about what we are teaching our children, what life lessons are important to learn. I also highly recommend this book to newcomers to Backman's work--this is an excellent place to start.Many thanks to Rachel Brenner and AtriaBooks/Simon & Schuster for offering me a special widget to read an ARC of this book through NG. I am so grateful for the opportunity; Fredrik Backman is definitely one of my favorite authors. Personal note: I confess to not being much of a hockey fan even though I grew up in the suburbs of one NHL city and moved to the suburbs of a second as an adult--but I'm always delighted when one of those two teams wins the Stanley Cup of course! My one big experience with the thrill of hockey came during the 1980 Winter Olympics when America's hockey team beat the Russians to win the gold medal. We were glued to our tv sets for that! Do you believe in miracles? Yes, we do!A second note: When we moved to a small city in Illinois in the early 80s, we found a similar sports culture surrounding their winning football team--similar to Beartown's hockey culture, that is. Those boys could just about get away with anything--even the police looked the other way. And middle-aged men sat in bars reminiscing about their glory days on the field--the highlight of their lives."

How the town responds and the decisions made changes life for good. It's absolutely heart wrenching. It's painful to read but it shows everyone's point of view so well.  Backman is absolutely one of the best authors writing now. He doesn't have many books out but each one tells an unique story. Britt-Marie Was Heretells the story of a middle aged woman starting life over, My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry is a young girl who is being protected by a fantasy life created by her grandmother and And Every Morning the Way Home Gets Longer and Longer is about a grandfather with Alzheimer's preparing his beloved grandson for what will come.

Based on a small forest town that solely relies on hockey. Every person in the town is impacted by this team, the sport, and the mascot it represents. You have class warfare from the Heights to the Hollows. The local bar-- (called Bearskin hehe) and the old school male point of view. The town is bustling for the big game of the year, the one that can change this town on the map-- everyone has skin in this game, and then something happens to test the strength of the game. Can they survive it?Backman has a way with words that grips your heart. The way he writes a succinct statement can change your perspective in an instant. For me, this immediately pulled me in. There were SO many characters to keep track of and their perspectives varied within chapters-- making it a rhythm that took me some to adjust to. For me, the book took too long to get to the meat of the plot. Over halfway through-- building, building, building and then whoosh-- I couldn't put it down. Backman builds the tension and leaves you hanging so that you are coerced into reading until you find out what happens. I had so many favorite characters that I found myself rooting for- some in small ways, others in much larger, heartbreaking ways. This is a great book that teaches so many important lessons about how a sport can turn against a town, and so much more. "

227,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41534121-katherine-brant,Rating 1 out of 5,"So I feel like at least one review of this book should say ""Trigger warning"". It's not clear when you read about this book what the subject matter is. If I'd know I wouldn't have picked it up, it's incredibly distressing to read wether it's a trigger or not. From what I read about it, I thought it was about a shooting in the woods and how the town heals from that through hockey, love and friendship. Your basic Backman book.What it's actually about is the rape of a 15 year old girl and the town taking sides between the victim and rapist. It was beyond horrible to read.It's also one of the worst books I've ever read. It's incredibly long winded, goes on and on and on about how ""important"" hockey is in Beartown to the point where it's gushing on every other page.I got fed up of reading vague sentences like ""The dad is still sitting in the kitchen"" or ""A teacher is standing in a class room"" or "" As the boy practices on his own"" I felt like I was reading some crappy fanfiction.I thought at least the ending would resolve everything and the rapist would be locked away or as I hoped killed.Spoilers.He gets away with it. The ending is vague and rubbish and Kevin has his own wife and child, left totally free to live his life and the whole book felt like a huge waste of time designed just to depress the reader. I don't understand how it's getting such warm reviews. I'm a big fan of Fredrik Backman and I unknowingly picked this up thinking I was going to read something fuzzy and heart warming like his other books. That's what I wanted to read. Instead I got this and I just kept hoping it would get better and be resolved but it didn't. It just breaks your heart, makes you lose faith in humanity and leaves you thinking WHAT SERIOUSLY?"

I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt quit. This book is so well written (if I can say that, since it was translated from Swedish). The story is very well developed and rich.

I have been watching hockey since before I can even remember with my dad. It took me a couple years to get back into hockey after he passed but I did go back to following the sport fanatically in the end. Anyways, this book follows a small community where hockey is first and foremost and the boys who make this team get the prime treatment. Including when one victimizes a young girl. The disturbing reaction of the community was so infuriating but it did not turn me away from the book. Instead I found myself rooting for somebody to come forward and punch some sense into these people! The brave in this book are not the ones the reader would expect. It was just a profound read. My quick and simple overall: are you kidding me, this is now one of my favorite books! "

231,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11701608-barbara,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 stars: ‚ÄúBeartown‚Äù captures the essence of small town politics and the laser focus and idolization of a beloved sport in said small town. Author Fredrick Backman MUST have lived in a small town and grown up around such venerated sport heroes. Backman picked hockey to tell his story, but it could have been football, perhaps basketball. In small towns across America, members of successful sport teams live above the law and outside the rules. Beartown is a hockey town. It‚Äôs a town in a remote area (the forest) in Sweden. Hockey is the heart and the lungs of the town. Without it, the townsfolk would have no purpose. The story opens with the junior team riding wins and focusing on the national championship. The culture of hockey dominates the story. The reader is treated to the inside conventions and customs of a team. The craze of the townsfolk and the obsession of winning are felt while reading. The hockey players are above the law, in school and on the streets. They know they can do whatever they want without ramifications. In fact, the feeling is drilled into them that they are gods and are deserving of anything they want. Backman writes those scenes with perfection. It‚Äôs realistic fiction, sadly.One of the star players is involved in a felonious act. He doesn‚Äôt see it as a felony because he has been taught that rules don‚Äôt apply to him. Some townspeople side with the hockey player, despite evidence to the contrary. Moral ambiguity is the catch phrase. Only the reader and the two involved know the story. Hypocrisy runs rampant. Backman does write redeeming characters. Not all are amoral. But hockey, as a culture, is difficult to cross. And some who cross it are dealt with swiftly and inhumanely. Backman shows the true ugliness of the sport.That said, Backman does a fabulous job showing how hockey (or any sport) instills discipline. It is a safe haven for those boys who need direction. It‚Äôs not all bad; there are redeeming characteristics of the sport.What Backman does best is show humanity at it‚Äôs worse and best. There are bits of humor sprinkled here and there, but it‚Äôs a big departure from his previous works like ‚ÄúA Man Called Ove‚Äù. I highly recommend this one, as Backman hits another one out of the park!"
232,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75801211-max,Rating 4 out of 5,"I'm very happy I decided to go into this one blind. This isn't a book I'd usually read, and most of my motivation was solely from Anxious People . The writing is still as amazing as ever from Backman, and I enjoyed it exploring themes of community, friendship, and loyalty. The ending was genuinely tense and had me a little bit more shaken than I was expecting. The only reason I can't give this five stars is because I thought there were a few unnecessary characters in an already fairly large set of a cast. It was a lot of moving parts, especially at the beginning when you'd transition into a different narrative in as soon as a single paragraph.Last night I tried to get into Us Against You, but made it fifty pages before I stopped. It wasn't because it was necessarily bad, I'm just surprised that this book needed a sequel let alone an upcoming trilogy."

It's the kind of book where I really wish I were more prudent about my five star ratings. It's taken its place alongside my all-time favorites ever. I loved it. It made me feel SO MUCH. Every character was complex and multi-faceted, not just good, not just bad, and so developed (shockingly, since we move around between a lot of characters). Its themes are rich and explored with nuance and compassion: loyalty, family, friendship, love, good vs. evil, truth, compassion, justice, hope, resilience. I cannot recommend it highly enough and want to put it into the hands of all the people in my life.Note: this book deals heavily and honestly with rape. It's heavy and hard to read. Make sure you're in the right headspace."

We need to breathe in order to read on."
235,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15962370-sarah,Rating 5 out of 5,"Gosh, this book made me angry! (but in a good way)Beartown is a small, parochial community in the forested north of Sweden. Jobs have been drying up over recent years and many in the community are struggling. The only thing that brings joy to many of the citizens is their collective obsession with hockey (ice hockey) and the town's beloved club, whose teams compete in the junior and A-leagues. This season, the Beartown junior team have qualified for the semi-final, and the excitement is electric.The first half of the novel, while thick with foreshadowing, is a slow-build to the pivotal event - a team party following the much-anticipated game, attended by many of the town's teenagers, during which a 15-year-old girl is raped by one of the youth team's star players.The rest of the book follows the reverberations from this incident, for the victim, her family, the perpetrator and his family, the other members of the team and the wider community of Beartown. It's a disquieting tale of misogynistic attitudes, warped priorities, conflicting loyalties and the finding of courage, to stand up for what's right and to survive.Earlier this year, I read Chanel Miller's brilliant Know My Name an account of the author's experiences as the then-unnamed victim/survivor of the notorious ""Stanford rape"" by elite swimmer-student Brock Turner. Although Beartown was published less than two years later, I suspect that Fredrik Backman must have been at least partly inspired by that true story, especially given that the two men who came to Miller's aid on the night she was raped (and apprehended Turner) were Swedish post-grads. Certainly, many of the issues and attitudes which fuelled fierce debate around Turner's arrest, trial and sentencing are raised in Beartown.As always, Backman's plotting and characters are superb. The backstory around the town and the generational change occurring at the Hockey club are poignant and insightful. He creates an appropriately tinderbox-like setting for the dramatic events that follow. With characteristically well-crafted prose, he explores his characters' motivations and fears extraordinarily well. While several characters are downright antagonistic and their behaviour easy to condemn, Backman makes them both believable and (to some extent) understandable. The characters on the side of moral ""right"", particularly Maya, Benji and Amat, certainly face a lot of hurdles over the course of the novel, but are not portrayed as saints, but as fallible individuals who struggle with their choices.My reading of Beartown was partly by way of listening to the Audioworks audiobook edition, narrated by Marin Ireland, and I took the first half fairly slowly. However, once the action heated up around the midway point, I read the remainder in only a couple of sittings.A really engrossing and thought-provoking read. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel, Us Against You, early in the new year."
236,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/188447-jessica-j,Rating 4 out of 5,"I actually hadn‚Äôt planned on reading this book. I liked Backman‚Äôs A Man Called Ove about a cranky old man learning to be...well, less cranky. It was sweet and heartwarming. But then he wrote three more variations on the same theme. And they were fine, if not quite as sweet and heartwarming as Ove. But, to be honest, I was kind of tired of reading the same story over and over again and so I didn‚Äôt think I was going to read this one. I‚Äôm not totally sure what caused me to give this book another look, but I‚Äôm so glad I did because it is definitely not just another rehash of the same plot points. In fact, it could not be more different than Ove. It‚Äôs about sports culture in a remote Swedish town where hockey is everything (if this was an American novel, it would have undoubtedly been about football). The Beartown Bears are one of the premier junior hockey teams in the country and seem to be on track for the championships. There are rumors that the star player, Kevin, might have a future in the NHL. And bringing home the trophy would have huge economic implications for the down-trodden town in the middle of nowhere. It‚Äôs an intense amount of pressure for a group of sixteen- and seventeen-year-old boys. But like star football players in a lot of American high schools, the boys essentially run the town. They‚Äôre given a wider berth for misbehavior than they might otherwise be given. And, perhaps because of that, one night between the semi-finals and the finals, things boil over into a violent act that literally threatens to tear the town apart. This read to me almost like a cross between We Were the Mulvaneys and The Art of Fielding. I think it might require a little bit more knowledge of hockey than the former did of baseball--or, at least some level of interest, because there are long passages simply describing practice routines and gameplay. But, really, the book is about the spiraling implications of this one violent act: how it affects players, coaches, parents, even the townspeople. How it strains friendships and marriages and career prospects of kids too young to drive. No one in Beartown is unaffected, and Backman is willing to spend time with just about everyone in the town as he wends his way through the story. Which is both good and not-so-good. He started the book off with one hell of a first page, but then the pacing slowed down a little too much. I might have given this five stars if it hadn‚Äôt dragged on quite so long. At times, I felt like there were too many small characters and too many threads being built up--it took nearly 200 pages for anything to really happen, and I can imagine that would become frustrating for many readers. This book tested my patience, but Backman tells his story with an almost unbelievable amount of honesty and empathy, even anger, and he ultimately drives the story into an incredibly powerful, heart-wrenching end. "
237,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4146473-connie-cox,Rating 5 out of 5,"My first book by Mr. Backman and if this is an indication of his masterful storytelling it will not be my last. I may be late to jump on his bandwagon but I will ride it all the way. Simply and beautifully done Mr. Backman. I recognized this small town, where hockey is king. This sport brings this community together. Not only the young players with big dreams and the men who coach them to achieve their best, but also the ""has beens"" and ""want to be's"" and all those who live their mundane boring lives with the goal of seeing that Friday night game alongside their neighbors. This is their team, they all claim ownership! I have seen it, in small communities where the way out of a factory job is being the best on the team...be it football, or baseball, or soccer. Dreams are big, and easily shattered. The characters we find in Beartown are the cream of the crop, the bad seeds, the good for nothings, the honest hard working folks. They are all here and wonderfully revealed and developed. They all have a part to play. Some of them play fair, others not so much. Out of this comes a wonderful story of youth, learning what is important, what is right and when a line is crossed where do you stand? My favorite characters were the young ones. They were almost like clay, molded by the adults, but with each one reaching a point where they claimed their own identities. This is not a story of the somewhat brutal sport of hockey....a mans game. It is the story of life, of relationships, of taking a stand based on what you believe. There is unity in these characters, a common goal. Yet Backman slowly reveals the individuals and when they reach the point when they set their own goals. This is a story that young, old, rich, poor, successful or not, should be able to relate to. It is a simply wonderful telling of what life is really like, disguised in the game of hockey."

SUMMARY
It is best to go into this book blind. All you need to know is that Beartown is a small-yet-eccentric hockey community, where the town is more forest that civilisation. But unless the Junior Hockey Team can make it into the finals and win, Beartown will disappear. What happens when you put so much pressure on young boys? What happens when a tragic assault of a young girl threatens to destroy the very town everyone is trying to save?
REVIEW
I read this book after seeing so many people on BookTube rave about it. I was a little skeptical, Beartown was out of my usual reading comfort-zone of fantasy and romance. However, I was utterly blow-away by this masterpiece. I am so glad that I read it. This is the first book I have ever physically annotated with highlighters. Never have I read a book with more beautiful prose, prose that screamed to be highlighted and remembered. I wish I could insert every beautiful and heartbreaking line in this review, but that would take away the magic you experience first-hand reading this story. The second I finished this book and threw my slew of used tissues in the bin, I flipped through my highlights. I reminisced and cried all over again at the phenomenal story that Backman crafted through irresistible prose. Yes, this is a large cast, a very large cast. I was overwhelmed in the beginning, afraid I would confuse whose parent was whose, and which hockey player was which. But Backman makes every character distinct, every family dynamic unique, and you fall for them without realsing. I cried like a child fresh out of the womb during this book. Whenever I hear that a story about rape is written by a man, I get wary. It may be sexist, but I am always worried that it will be portrayed in the wrong light. I was wrong in the case of Backman. Beartown has one of the most real and heartbreaking outlooks on rape culture - especially in a small community. I was crying, not just for the girl, but her friends and family as well (I say ""the girl"" because I don't want to spoil the book). I wish I could go into detail about how this story affected me, how the girl's experience broke something within me, how I just wanted to curl up and cry on my couch for hours, but I can't - because it will break me all over again. This is novel is a tale about a town that is broken and trying to keep itself together by frantically duct-taping the cracks. It is raw and real, and you feel and care for every single character.So please, just trust me. Read this book. It will change your life. "
242,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39633342-tucker,Rating 4 out of 5,"‚ÄúWhy does anyone care about hockey? Because it tells stories.‚Äù In ‚ÄúBeartown‚Äù Fredrik Backman uses hockey as the framework for his novel, but it applies equally well to any sport in any community that has an out-size impact on players, their parents, former players, and ordinary residents. In Beartown, the junior boys hockey team is the heart and hope of the community. Residents believe that if the team can win the national finals (and they have a very good shot at doing so), it will bring a new hockey academy, conference center, malls, and jobs to the dying town. But everything changes when one of the players commits a violent and brutal act, one which deeply divides the town. ‚ÄúBeartown‚Äù was a little slow getting started because Backman has so many characters to introduce. But that slow build-up really pays off in the richness of the characters, characters that could be straight from your life, and most importantly, characters you really care about. The book focuses on some extremely powerful emotional issues, but never gets bogged down in moralizing or cheap sentiment. ‚ÄúBeartown‚Äù has a darker tone and story line than any of Backman‚Äôs previous books, but courage, love, and the bonds of family and friends shine through. His empathetic, sensitive, and insightful understanding of the human heart, with all it‚Äôs fears and desires, truly makes his work stand out, and he‚Äôs one of my favorite authors to recommend.Thank you to Atria Books and NetGalley for an advance copy of this book."

248,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/676000-susan-meissner,Rating 5 out of 5,"I‚Äôm surprised by how much I loved this book because the backdrop is all things hockey. That it‚Äôs by Fredrik Backman is pretty much the only reason I decided to give it a listen (I loved A MAN CALLED OVE), because, again the backdrop is hockey. I don‚Äôt dislike hockey. I actually like hockey, and since my husband used to play it when he was much younger, he likes watching the Stanley Cup Finals and I usually watch with him, with him patiently answering my ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the puck?‚Äù every ten seconds without a complaint (that little black disc ‚Äì even smaller on TV ‚Äì is hard to keep track of). I just never pictured myself picking up (or picking out) a novel with hockey players on its cover.The story is set in a Swedish town but the narrative reads like the setting could be any place in Minnesota where the population is less than five thousand and the only thing to do in winter (which lasts a long, long time) is play or watch ice hockey. Hockey is more than just that, though. It‚Äôs not the only thing you can do; it‚Äôs the only thing you WANT to do. It‚Äôs the only thing. It‚Äôs THE thing. And into this mini cosmos, Mr. Backman introduces an ensemble of characters ‚Äì some in their teens, some in their 40‚Äôs, some somewhere in between ‚Äì whose lives and choices play out in and beyond and behind this ice. It‚Äôs truly a book about people, not hockey, even though you can feel the numbing cold, taste the blood on your lip from a slamming body check, even see the puck. And the people in this tableau are so richly drawn and perfectly imperfect. The ending is everything an ending should be. Surprising and deeply satisfying. One word of caution: I listened to the book on audio (and with an audio book, you hear EVERY word). The language can be hard on the ear; it was on mine. If the prolific use of the F-bomb makes you cringe, you might want to read instead of listen or choose another book. If you can see (or hear) past that, it's an absolutely stellar book."
249,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/85505643-darcey,Rating 5 out of 5," buddy read with the wonderful Anna-Lena!*sobs*this book. y'all, THIS BOOK. i just- these characters-i would murder to be inside Fredrik Backman's brain for a day, just to see how he perceives the world, and to try and understand how he manages to detail those thoughts so beautifully into some of the most realistic, stunning, heartbreaking, devastating, beautiful novels on this planet. i have yet to read a single Fredrik Backman novel that doesn't make me cry - both from happiness and sorror, and also just because i'm so blown away by how Backman writes his characters? Beartown was no exception - it was horribly believable, terribly realistic and wonderfully written. this is known to be one of Backman's darkest novels, and i can definitely see why, because it was so incredibly heartwrenching - i honestly couldn't take it sometimes. i had to take breaks when reading this, because it made me so 
angry
 at how 
f*cked up
 this patriarchal society is. people are monsters, and sometimes they don't even mean to be, and that makes it worse?this book is definitely an amazing book for a discussion - it left me writing long paragraphs to my buddy-read partner, and i spent whole minutes after i finished this just pondering some of the situations in this book. absolutely amazing!!"
250,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/81046856-sandra,Rating 4 out of 5,"Being from the UK I know absolutely nothing about ice hockey! But I do remember being on holiday in Canada quite a few years ago and hearing car after car driving down the road, horns tooting, people leaning out the windows waving flags and cheering.....we were told the local ice hockey team had won !So with my very limited knowledge I did wonder if this book would interest me. Luckily, even though the game was a constant through the book it was not in any great technical detail, so I coped ok! It was well written and the passion for the game came through. This book could be about any small town, the quirky characters, the good and bad relationships and how a small town can come together and equally pull apart. But the difference with Beartown is, it‚Äôs a small town dominated by it‚Äôs ice hockey team and all the passion and bad blood that goes with it and how the whole town copes with a ‚Äòlife changing‚Äô event. I thoroughly enjoy it but I didn‚Äôt always relate to the behaviour of the characters, I thought the flow of the story was often repetitive, whether it was the love you feel for your children or the preparation and training for a game...... win, win win etc ! I do feel that it could have been a shorter book. I know I am in the minority but this book did not give me a big buzz, as I thought it would."

252,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1381728-maxwell,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book was probably the most difficult one to read of all of Backman's books for me. It deals with rape, so if that's not something you want in your literature, I would suggest avoiding this one because it deals very heavily with the subject. That being said, it handles the topic really well, as frustratingly accurate as it can be at times. My only criticism of the book is that it felt a bit long; it's mostly the reader watching events unfold along with the lives of these characters, but I really enjoyed nearly all of the characters in this book so I was ok with the length in the end. Backman is definitely one of my go-to authors and I'll read anything he writes. It's got a lot of heart, a good message, and manages to make you laugh and cry, sometimes in the span of a single page.

""Late one evening toward the end of March, a teenager picked up a double-barreled shotgun, walked into the forest, put the gun to someone else‚Äôs forehead, and pulled the trigger. This is the story of how we got there.""

Initial Thoughts
After just finishing a second rate horror novel I was in the mood for a surefire five star book to get me back on my reading track. I was recommended Bear Town by Fredrick Backman by a good friend who knows exactly what type of books I like. Plus it heavily features Ice Hockey, which is a sport I love. I grew up around it, with a brother who played to quite a high level. So this looked like the book for me.Its currently got a 4.27 rating on here, a number of my Goodreads buddies had awarded it five stars and raved about it. Having sat on my TBR for over a year, the stars were aligned with this one. The coffee was brewed, the salted peanuts at the ready. I was all set for a great time. What could possibly go wrong?
The Story 
As illustrated by the opening quote, the novel begins with a gunshot in the middle of a forest. The story that follows tells us how we got there. Taking place in the fictional location of Bear Town, a place that eats, sleeps and breathes Ice Hockey, we get the story of a financially deprived community that is pinning all its hopes on the sport they love. The junior teams march to the regional final presents Bear Town's one and only chance to bring honour, pride and much needed investment to its inhabitants. The question is...what are they prepared to sacrifice to get there?When a traumatic event occurs and accusations are aimed at the teams superstar player and team captain, we're going to find out who is prepared to put their morals to one side in the pursuit of success. It's something that could turn team mates into enemies and rip an entire community apart. For me this had the set up for a great story.
The Writing 
But then I hit a massive stumbling block and it really pains me to say it. I really wanted to love this book but I had some major issues with Backman's writing style. It is very different in that he uses an omnipresent narrator, that jumps about quickly from character, while injecting the authors own philosophy on events taking place. At first I was enjoying it, as it was fresh and unique, but it quickly started to grate on me. Particularly the choppy sentence structure and the way it jumped about at a rapid pace.Despite the short sentences and page breaks, the overall pace was slow and the story dragged its feet toward a pretty anticlimactic finish that was predictable. A complete contrast to the sport the novel is based on. There's very little twist and turns and it does get a little repetitive. Dare I say quite pedestrian and boring in parts? Yes I do! You could shave a hundred pages off and the book certainly wouldn't have suffered.Backman's style is also a classic case of tell not show, where he constantly prompts the reader in certain directions and came across as trying to interpret events for me. I'm a reader who normally likes to be presented with events and have the chance to make my own mind up. Another problem is the authors lack of description. Bear Town is an intriguing setting in a harsh and primaeval location that I was immediately interested in. But he barely describes it choosing to give us the basic blot along with the narrator's take on what's going down.
The Characters 
Because there's a lot of characters, and Backman constantly jumps between each one, we don't seem to get a lot of development for any of them. I don't want to go as far as saying they were cardboard, but I will say that none were very fleshed out and as a result I never got invested and start to care for them.The main character of Peter Andersson, the hockey club general manager, was particularly annoying. A player that apparently made it all the way through Swedish ice hockey, which is an often brutal and unforgiven sport, he was an absolute wimp. There's some really bad things happen to his teenage daughter and his response was completely shocking in the lack of one. Maybe I took it too personally, as a father of a young daughter myself, but it really did wind me up.Another thing that turned me off was the majority of female characters seemed to look down on their male partners and friends with statements like 
""You're an idiot, but I love you.""
 I would have found this slightly humerus but it started to become a repetitive theme. Not quite sure where Backman was going with this one but it wasn't for me. Pretty much like all of the characters in the book. I will say that Benji, the tough as nails, gay player did endear himself to me. If I had to pick a favourite it would be him but there were aspects that were forced and a touch unrealistic. Still, if I had to route for someone in this story it would definitely be for him and he could come and play for my team any day.
Final Thoughts 
Damn! That's two negative reviews in a row from me now and I don't like to do that. I'm gutted I didn't love Bear Town as on the surface it looked like my type of book. Although it was a big disappointment, I'm not going to feel bad about it as there's plenty of good reviews for it and I think it's just not my type of book.Being honest it came across as a bit of a young adult novel and had a soap opera quality to it. There was a lot of teenage angst in there. Certainly not my type of thing.However, don't take my opinion as gospel (what do I know lol) and certainly read some of the positive reviews to give yourself a more balanced take. This book did tackle some very important issues, but it's not enough to save it from a 2.5 star rating.Sorry Mr Backman. But if you're reading...thanks and cheers!"
260,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/145110064-taylor-x1f48c,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 stars! I want to preface by saying I don‚Äôt totally think this is a book for absolutely everyone. While I think this book is incredibly beautiful and human and everyone could probably learn something about the human experience from it, the content in it probably wouldn‚Äôt be for everyone (check TWs). I really connected with this story coming from a small town that had similar circumstances/idologies so I think that really connected me to the story in ways that were both special and uncomfortable. Backman is an absolute master at writing characters, this book has a MILLION characters but I felt like every single one had some sort of notable arc. I felt like all of these characters were so real (like watching a tv show, which no I won‚Äôt be watching the TV show bc the casting looks so off to me). As a strictly romance/fantasy girl I can say this is by far my favorite general fiction I‚Äôve read and I look forward to continuing this series when my heart hurts less. "
261,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6891162-john-martin,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was the second Fredrik Backman novel I read in 2017. It was nothing like A Man Called Ove, which made me laugh a lot. This is a much darker novel, and it's chockers with moral questions. The writing is masterful. By the end, you know what makes the many characters tick, you feel the cold, you know the smells of Beartown, you've been taken on a ride from the rich end of town to the poor end of town, and you've looked good and evil in the face. If there is a better writer in the world than Backman at the moment, I haven't had the priviledge."

264,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57236678-iryna-book-and-sword,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.25/5 stars‚ÄúEveryone has a thousand wishes before a tragedy, but just one afterward.‚Äù‚ÄãThis is the hardest book I've ever had to read in my life. I've only had other 2 books that gave me such a hard time and those were The Flowers for Argenon by Daniel Keyes and Challenger Deep by Neil Shusterman. Still those two books can't compete with how brutal Beartown was on me.Beartown is not a happy book. It's not an easy book, nor is it pleasant. Not even close. It's a hard, heavy book that made me feel angry and helpless. Did I enjoy it? No. But I did love it.Would I read it again? I don't think I'd be able to handle it again. Do I recommend Beartown? - YESYESYESYESYES ‚ÄúBitterness can be corrosive. It can rewrite your memories as if it were scrubbing a crime scene clean, until in the end you only remember what suits you of its causes.‚ÄùBeartown is a hokey town. I myself don't like hockey, and to be honest with you I think I even hate it now. If you are a hockey fan this book will speak to you on another level. If you are not a hockey fan, there are things in Beartown that are more important than hockey. Because I don't care about hockey the first 150 pages of the book were a drag, but I'm glad I stuck around anyway, because this book pulverized me. I was expecting something along the lines of A man called Ove - sad, quirky and with lots of tears. Beartown was nothing like that - it was brutal, pretty depressing and instead of tears I just got buckets of rage. Want to feel angry? Want to feel blind rage coursing through your veins? Read Beartown. ‚ÄúThe very worst events in life have that effect on a family: we always remember, more sharply than anything else, the last happy moments before everything fell apart.‚Äù‚ÄãBackman weaves the story of a small town community, but somehow it's the most personal and intimate thing you will ever read. The characters are introduced and the array of emotions you go through as those characters make their choice vary from affection to ""I want to kill them all"".‚ÄãThe writing is precise and choppy - somehow perfect for the cold bareness of the Beartown, but it brings more dimensions to the story than any flowery and overly wordy writing ever could. Backman might as well be a genius of human psyche, because man knows what he's doing, and he's doing it really, really well. My WEBSITEMy INSTAGRAMMy WORDPRESS BLOG"

I thought - wow, that's awesome for a book about hockey! I just don't think the majority of females love to read about sports, but females are loving this book!?! Now I see why...this book is not about hockey. There are actually only a few games even played in the book. This book has a very large cast of characters. I listened to the audio version and it was really, really good!! To actually follow the life of each person and remember all the little details is sometimes hard on audio. But, Fredrik Backman has a unique ability to describe his characters. To make you see them, feel them, feel their pain, their happiness, anger, longing - all of the wonderful emotions that happen while you read this. There are more than 10 really fantastic characters that you will LOVE. And very much like his debut A Man Called Ove, this book is about - relationships, actions, friends, confidences, societal norms, jobs. It's also about being part of a team, and being a member of a town who essentially feel as if they are also.......part of the team. Of course, this is happy times when they are the winning team!!! Hockey is LIFE, in their small town. And as we all know.....it's very hard to put LIFE on the shoulders of teens!!Definitely pick this one up, immediately! And be prepared to immerse yourself in Beartown!!!!"

I don¬¥t think I get out all the words that I need to.This book is just...amazing. A book that manages to tug on every emotion I have doesn¬¥t deserve anything less than 5 stars.It¬¥s so realistic and everything that happens, the injustice, the happy things, the sad things...it¬¥s real life, it¬¥s how things can be and often are. As a parent myself, and a parent of teenagers, I felt everything the parents in this book felt (apart from one parent that is). Christ how frustrated and angry I got at times, it was driving me nuts. But that¬¥s how life is and unfortunately we can¬¥t always protect the ones we love, it¬¥s just not possible, no matter how hard you want to and try to and that is so frightening to know. I needed to read this book, it was a wake up call in some ways and a slap in the face in others."

And if you're thinking to yourself, ""It's about hockey? But I hate/don't care/have no interest in hockey."" READ IT ANYWAY. It's about SO much more. Hockey is the canvas and the words are the masterpiece painted over it. I don't know if I'll come back and write a proper review. I'm kind of all over the place with my thoughts right now but suffice to say this was on of the best books I've ever read."

Best sellers and I make strange bedfellows.Some of what worked against it was me, not it. I'm not big on sweeping tales--either vertical in time (one of those generational sagas) or horizontal in scope (huge canvas, dozens of characters). I do not do well with 3rd-person omniscient point of view, either. A bit too clinical for me. I'm much more convinced by the heart and soul of 1st or 3rd limited. And authorial interruptions! The asides about ten years from now, or does-something-he'll-regret-in-a-few-chapters-as-you'll-see, or I-know-something-you-don't-because-I'm-God!No. I don't like to see the author waving. I like him invisible. I like to pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.And a bit too pat an ending? Oh, yeah. Hollywood endings--even in Sweden--have always grated on me. I would be a horrible test audience for a film that has an unpleasant ending. The sole ""keep it as is"" vote, I fear.That all said, I have to respect the design and scope here. It had some surprises for me. It lumbered off the blocks in the beginning, yes; it was entirely too long, yes, again; but it picked up nicely at crunch time. I enjoyed stretches. And I liked certain characters. Precious few. And this despite feeling manipulated a bit by a sentimental and didactic author. Big of me, I know.So overall, enjoyable despite the odds. And despite how claustrophobic (among other phobias) this small town in Sweden (that could've been in Pennsylvania) felt.*That's saying something. Hats off to Mr. Hockey. I hated to sort of like your book, which, in the end, barely escaped the trap of becoming unbearable._____*Note, however, that Backman never locates it geographically. Anywhere hockey is played and human nature is displayed, was his wish. So be it."

272,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108107597-nicole-leigh-reads,Rating 5 out of 5,"Beartown was SO much more than I thought it would be. (CW: sexual assault) Fredrik Backman, why do you cause me so much pain? Why do you make me feel so much love? I'm a mess.How can this novel be described? I'm not sure it can. It is one of the rawest, realest books I've read and it is on a very raw and real topic. This book is chock-full of nuance. It shows you every single perspective, as well as how toxic culture is systemic. And that it can get that way on accident, occurring from a town filled with people who think they're doing the right thing. And maybe they are, maybe they're not. It's complicated. It's so, so incredibly complicated.But boy is it good. It's so, so incredibly good.I truly cannot be more touched by someone's writing than Backman's, this I do believe. And despite that for the first 40 pages the constant jumping of perspectives and introducing new characters right after the other made my head kind of spin, I was totally on board. And I got used to the POV shifts. As well as fully went from ""now wait, who's this? How can I ever remember all of these people?"" To feeling like I knew them all like the back of my hand. So! Off to immediately jump into the sequel. And pray every day will be the day that the third installment of this series is translated into English. (Or that I miraculously learn Swedish just to be able to read it.)"

Amat, who wants so much for his mother to have an easier life, but how much will he sacrifice for that? Maya, who stands strong and tall, throughout trials unbelievable. Benji, who's just about the greatest a person can be. Ramona, who sees everything and isn't afraid to speak out. Fredrik Backman knows people and brings them to life. This story is deep on many sides. Yes, there is hockey....lots of it... but the story is about culture and what we will abide to give our heroes everything.I really enjoyed how this story unfolded and how we learned of people's thoughts & choices."

THIS BOOK IS INCREDIBLE.This book explores the politics of a small hockey town and a scandal that shakes the town. It really explores how people choose to believe what they want to believe to keep their peace of mind and how victim-blaming is unfortunately still a huge issue. It's both heartbreaking and heartwarming and takes you through a whole spectrum of emotionsThis book also jumps from story to story and perspective to perspective, so if that's not for you, just know that going in. I think it's worth it for the overall story.tw for rape"

277,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6450088-tania,Rating 4 out of 5,"""Never trust people who don't have something in their lives that they love beyond all reason.""I've read every single book by this author, and this is now my second favorite after And every morning the road home gets longer and longer. Although I enjoyed his first three books, I'm very glad to see that he is moving away from what was becoming almost formula writing. In Beartown the author shows us the best and worst of humankind, by creating many characters who all make both terrible AND wonderful decisions. The story is not a new one, but this book does not focus on the event, but on how our situation, history and prejudices affect our reaction to an event. I loved that the focus is not so much on the people it happened to, but on everyone else having to decide what they will think/do about it. A point proven by the fact that I have sooo many favorite characters in this book, but the ones I felt least connected to was the involved parties. The reason I read everything this author publishes is his amazing way of saying something about everyday life that we all already know, but saying it in such a way that it resonates very deeply with me. On being a poor kid: He doesn't want possessions. He just wants to lie in bed one single night without having to count.  (money)On a parenting: If she does everything right at work, things usually go as planned, but if doesn't matter if she does absolutely everything in the universe correctly as a mother; the very worst can still happen.I highly recommend this thought-provoking, unique and touching (I had tears rolling down my face for the last 20%) story."

First of all, there were SO MANY characters. Second, it was a bit too slow for my taste. So it took me a long time to warm up to the story and because of that, I lost some of my interest. Fourth I‚Äôm not a sports fan (especially Hockey) and 90% of the story was around Hockey. Told in multiple POV, 3rd prson, it‚Äôs the first installment in the ""Beartown"" series but it can be read as a standalone. Hope you enjoy it!"

I felt like ""okay, this town loves hockey, ""I get it"", but now can we get on with the story"".. I did connect with a few of the characters but did some eye rolling at the very end. This reminded me of a movie called, ""Mystery Alaska"" but this is definitely not a comedy. Another buddy read with my good bud Mary. "

284,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39152983-peter,Rating 2 out of 5,"This is only the second book I‚Äôve read by Backman, the first one was ‚ÄúBritt-Marie Was Here‚Äù. They are much the same in many respects (just swap out football in ‚ÄúBritt-Marie Was Here‚Äù for ice hockey in ‚ÄúBeartown‚Äù and you‚Äôre there) yet also very different in other ways: whereas ‚ÄúBritt-Marie Was Here‚Äù is witty, funny, and quirky, ‚ÄúBeartown‚Äù is preachy, woke, and predictable. Evidently the author felt it necessary to write ‚Äúseriously‚Äù because he dealt with serious social problems: rape and homophobia. However, notwithstanding the scourge these practices truly represent, the narrative is just a little too sentimental and obvious for my taste. Everything that happens is pretty much what you would expect and I often had the feeling that the story was written for emotional effect, but perhaps that is unfair to the author. I was also not overly impressed by the translation into English (serves me right for not attempting the book in Swedish, a language I have a basic working knowledge of). E.g. the rendering of the Swedish word ‚Äúsnus‚Äù as ‚Äúchewing tobacco‚Äù is misleading. Snus is a form of wet tobacco that is placed between the upper lip and the gums (it is not ‚Äúchewed‚Äù), from where the nicotine is absorbed directly into the bloodstream. A very effective and clean form of nicotine consumption, apart from the spitting! Snus is illegal in the EU, except in Sweden, where it is very common."

This does not effect my opinion in any way.Actual rating: 4.5 stars rated up!--‚ÄúWhen you lose in hockey it feels like having your heart scalded. When you win, you own the clouds. Beartown is a heavenly town this evening.‚ÄùWow. Just wow. I have never read anything by Fredrik Backman before, but let me tell you, I definitely plan on picking up his other novels as soon as possible. Beartown is one of the best books I have read all year. It was unexpectedly dark, yet it dealt with these tough topics perfectly. I‚Äôm still thinking about this book more than a week after finishing it.--What I LikedThe character driven story. I absolutely love character driven stories, even more so than plot driven stories. I loved that Beartown jumped back and forth between the perspectives of multiple characters throughout the entire novel. I love hearing a story from many points of view and while it can sometimes be confusing and hard to keep track of all the characters, Fredrik Backman masterfully made this story easy to follow. The characters were all phenomenally written and while there were a few characters I absolutely DESPISED, there were many that I kept wanting to read more about. Amat, Benji, Sune, Ramona, Maia & Ana were by far my favourite characters throughout the story and I couldn‚Äôt wait to learn more about each of them.The writing. Fredrik Backman has most likely just become a favourite author of mine. I have literally only read Beartown, but I‚Äôm already thinking about ordering his other books ASAP. The writing is just phenomenal. As mentioned, I loved that Beartown was a very character driven story told from many perspectives and Fredrik Backman wrote it perfectly. It flowed so well considering the fact that it jumped from character to character constantly. There was just something about his writing style that makes me want to read everything he has ever written.The hard hitting topics. Let me just preface this paragraph with a spoiler warning. This paragraph also calls for a trigger warning around the topic of rape. What started as a story about small-town hockey, turned into a much darker story about rape and white male privilege. I wasn‚Äôt expecting this story to go in the direction that it did as it turned out to be really hard-hitting and quite unexpectedly dark. A young teenaged girl is raped and while that was hard enough to read on its own, it was even harder to read about how some of the other characters dealt with the situation. I have never felt more disgusted in my life than when I read what some of the other male and female characters opinions were on the situation. What was most disgusting about all of it is that it isn‚Äôt far fetched. It isn‚Äôt unrealistic. This is all too common. Rich white boy with a promising future rapes someone and people come to his defence because they don‚Äôt want to see his career as a professional hockey player tarnished. It‚Äôs disgusting and completely unacceptable. Fredrik Backman writes about this terrible crime in a way that is sadly so realistic, but he also writes it in such a way that as a reader, we know that he is completely aware and understands that this is reality. That if this really happened, people would actually defend this scumbag. I was honestly completely blown away by the way Fredrik Backman wrote this story and how he was able to make me feel countless emotions while reading it.--What I Didn‚Äôt LikeA tad slow moving. The only little tiny minor thing that I didn‚Äôt like was the pace of the novel. Yes, it flowed well and I couldn‚Äôt put it down, but it did kind of take a while to get going. The first quarter or so was a little slow, but once the story picked up, it was all I could think about. As mentioned, this was a little tiny minor complaint. Otherwise, this story was flawless.--‚ÄúThere are thousands of ways to die in Beartown. Especially on the inside.‚ÄùI just can‚Äôt stop thinking about this book and the characters within. It was good and so well written. I need more. I can‚Äôt wait to dive further into the work of Fredrik Backman!--Initial post reading thoughts:Damn. That was a tough one. I was definitely not expecting the subject matter to be so dark and hard-hitting. There were moments that made me happy, but mostly there were moments that made me feel so angry. It is completely disgusting that events such as the one that takes place in this novel are so common. I need some time to properly assess my thoughts and feelings, but just know that this was one of the best books I have read so far this year."

So, if you were like me and haven‚Äôt read it yet ‚Äì well, you know what I will say next: what are you waiting for?!In Beartown hockey is everything. The town is counting on the junior hockey team to win a championship ‚Äì not just for the glory ‚Äì but for the economic success that would come with it; that is a lot of pressure for seventeen year old boys. The town (parents, former players, board members and sponsors) all say to act in the best interest of the team, but their viewpoints are more selfish than they will ever realize? How far would you go to win? One of the players will commit an act of violence and a young girl will be forever changed. Who will the town rally behind and why? How does one act when the truth could ruin everything?You will love and you will hate, really hate, some of these characters. If you are like me, you will wish you were written into this story as a character so you would have the opportunity to shut one of them up. My goodness did I despise this character. If you read this, or decide to read, you can only guess who I am talking about. Let‚Äôs discuss! The characters you love, you really love. It is pretty simple, you either love them or hate them: the character development ‚Äì hero or villain ‚Äì was strong.There were many characters introduced in the beginning, but I was so engaged in the story that it was easy to keep track.

Also, good lessons on being who you truly are, and the pain that comes from hiding that in order to fit in or to become popular.Teen years are fraught with dangers, and parents try to do their best. Sometimes their own issues get in the way. I found it really interesting how some of the (main) characters are not given names. Only ""Kevin's dad"" or ""the mom.""I also notched down one star because of the vulgar language which was overdone, and too prevalent. I can tolerate some profanity and some sexism, but not sure this extent was necessary.Still, Backman is a fantastic writer and I will likely read the sequel (once I recover)."

Absolutely brilliant. My first book by Backman and it was so good, I‚Äôm worried how the others will measure up to this. Beautifully written and deliberately slow, this is not a book to chomp down on overnight, for it demands attention and introspection, with lots of lovely passages to mull over. And yet its true strength lies in the characters, each so real and relatable, with their all-too-human moments of triumph and weakness, no clear villains or heroes anywhere.And yes, so feminist and empowering, and handled so right.

294,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/671638-sharon,Rating 4 out of 5,"I gobbled this up in two days. It's a terrific, important read that really tugs at the heartstrings and simultaneously makes your blood boil.This marks my third novel by Fredrik Backman. I thoroughly enjoyed A Man Called Ove but found the storyline and main character a little too familiar and a lot too precious. My Grandmother Asked You To Tell You She's Sorry was awkward and borderline unreadable to the point I almost gave up.I had heard fantastic things about Beartown thanks to the good folks here at Goodreads: I managed to skim over the reviews to remain relatively ignorant about the plot. I knew it was about a hockey town. (I like hockey.) Miracle and Mystery, Alaska this was not, however.This is a story that can really test you: there's difficult subject matter in here. Characters are complicated and significantly flawed. Life is tough. Heroes have not earned their place in the spotlight.In the age of soccer moms and little league dad brawls and sports hero worship and ultra competitiveness, I could see--and completely understand--a lot of people not enjoying this story for the simple fact that it hits way too close to home. I was on the other side, however: 1) totally impressed at how deep and dark Backman went (I haven't pegged his style yet; the three novels I've read to date are so, so different), and 2) nodding my head up and down in earnest at his portrayal of teenagers carrying the weight of a town on their shoulders: a town that is unknowingly--or knowingly, but looking the other way--harming their young for ""a greater good."" It's a cautionary tale about ""group think"" (examined at the sports team level, the school level, the community level, and town). It's about the outliers that come forward in the midst of group think, despite the consequences. I don't think I've read a book as successful at illustrating the dangers of youth sports and its ugly underbelly.I'm at a 4.5 or so. I can't get to 5, because towards the end, there were still a few ""Ove"" moments: a bit too neatly wrapped up for my liking. But given how engrossed I was in the book as a whole, I'd still pronounce it one of my favorite reads of the year."

By the lake in Beartown there is an ice rink and therein lies hope for the future of Beartown. There the junior ice hockey team is about to skate in the national semi-finals. The hopes and dreams of an entire town rest on the shoulders of a handful of teenagers. The semi-final match is followed by an act of violence that leaves a fifteen year old girl traumatized and will tear the town apart.This is a coming of age story for a teenage girl who must make a choice between whether to speak out or keep silent. It is the story of team mentality. And it is the story of courage and doing the right thing for the right reason no matter the cost. A hockey championship could lure a hockey academy to Beartown and turn around the economy. But at what price?This is a darker novel than ""A Man Called Ove"" but there are several heroes in this story. Characters who exhibit strength and courage. It isn't easy being a teenager and it is made even more difficult if an entire town is pinning it's hopes on you to win a hockey championship. This story runs the gamut of emotions. The characters are flawed and distinct. A masterful storyteller."

Backman clearly understands the human mind, thoughts and emotions so well. This is about far more than just a sport or a town. It‚Äôs a deep look at humankind and a statement on society. The writing style took a little getting used to for me but I liked that there were multiple storylines that are followed individually as well as when they intersect with others. I loved how it jumped between perspectives and storylines, it really helped to get the full picture and see the ripple effect of different decisions. It was interesting to learn about so many different characters and see a lot of growth in most of them. It was hard and sad to read, but brought up a lot of important topics and discussion points. "

Hockey is the game that keeps the town alive, and has long bound the small town of Beartown together. Count on Bachman to deliver a story that is full of ponderable questions about love, loyalty, and how far you will go to win... in hockey and in life.A very good and thought provoking book. 5 stars"

We are reminded about the woes, dramas and mannerisms of the not so likeable characters (what they like or don't like, how they feel or don't feel) in every single chapter.

Gradiƒá koji se nalazi negdje Bogu iza nogu i za kojeg ne bi svi sa stopostotnom sigurno≈°ƒáu mogli reƒái da znaju gdje se nalazi. Dugo bi ka≈æiprsti ≈°arali i lutali po zemljopisnoj karti kada bi nekoga upitali da vam ga poka≈æe. Gradiƒá kojeg dosta stanovnika svake godine napusti, bez ikakve nostalgije i eventualne ≈æelje za povratkom. Ali, unatoƒç svemu ≈°to je izgubio, Medvedgrad se jo≈° uvijek dr≈æi na nogama, a njegovi stanovnici su ujedinjeni iz jednog jednostavnog razloga- hokeja!Hokej kao da je urezan u kamen temeljac Medvedgrada. Prvo ≈°to su tvorniƒçki radnici unatrag nekoliko generacija u njemu napravili bilo je klizali≈°te. Ljubav prema ledu prenosila se s koljena na koljeno. Djeca su dobivala klizaljke i palice i prije nego su konkretno prohodala. Hokej je ono ≈°to dr≈æi Medvedgrad na nogama. Oƒçi cijelog grada uprte su u mlade hokeja≈°e i njihovu utakmicu u dr≈æavnom polufinalu, u nadi da ƒáe njihovi trofeji probuditi staru slavu grada, privuƒái investitore i tako ga jo≈° jednom povesti ga prema prosperitetu. Ipak, nitko nije mogao oƒçekivati da ƒáe sve u ≈°to graƒëani Medvedgrada vjeruju do≈æivjeti potres, ≈°to ƒáe omoguƒáiti nekim starim tajnama da izaƒëu na vidjelo, tajne zbog kojih bi se cijeli grad mogao okrenuti naglavaƒçke, pa ƒçak i ustaljeno slijepo podr≈æavanje svega ≈°to s hokejom veze ima. Nije tako te≈°ko za pretpostaviti za≈°to se romani Fredrika Backmana prodaju u milijunskim nakladama i za≈°to je ono, ≈°to se krije meƒëu njihovim koricama, osvojilo milijune srca diljem svijeta. Ove, Bakica, malena Elsa i Britt- Marie samo su neki od osebujnih likova kojima je ovaj pisac udahnuo ≈æivot. Njih je Backman utkao u priƒçe koje izazivaju ogroman spektar emocija; od iritacije, tuge, sjete, pa sve do neizmjerne sreƒáe. Priƒçe ƒçija se ljepota krije u ƒçinjenici da su tako prokleto jednostavno ≈æivotne, priƒçe u kojima svatko, u jednom malom njihovom dijelu, mo≈æe pronaƒái dio sebe.Backmanovi likovi su ljudi s kojima sam se, unatoƒç njihovoj ƒçangrizavosti, neotesanosti, opsesivnoj ≈æelji za redom ili mo≈æda ru≈°enjem svih pravila, tako lako sprijateljio, dopustio im da mi se uvuku pod ko≈æu, toliko da su mi nedostajali u trenutku kada sam proƒçitao posljednje stranice knjiga u kojima obitavaju i po≈æelio ih imati za svoje susjede. Za razliku od svih dosada≈°njih naslova, glavni junak Medvedgrada nije jedan, obiƒçno osebujan i ≈æivopisan lik, na ≈°to smo se naviknuli u Backmanovim romanima. Nisu to Kira i Peter, odvjetnica i menad≈æer medvedgradskog hokeja≈°kog kluba, roditelji dvoje djece i supru≈ænici obilje≈æeni straviƒçnom obiteljskom tragedijom. Nisu to ni David i Sune, hokeja≈°ki treneri, predstavnici stare i nove generacije medvedgradskog hokeja. Nisu to Kevin, Benji ili Bobo, mladi perspektivni hokeja≈°i u zamahu sa sportskim uspjesima zbog kojih se podi≈æe moral cijelog grada. Nisu to Amat, djeƒçak koji sanja jednog dana postati uspje≈°nim hokeja≈°em; i njegova majka Fatima, koja ≈ærtvuje sve ≈°to mo≈æe kako bi omoguƒáila sve najbolje svome sinu. Naposljetku, nisu to ni Maya i Ana, tinejd≈æerice s tipiƒçnim tinejd≈æerskim problemima, djevojke koje tra≈æe svoje mjesto pod zvjezdanim medvedgradskim nebom. Nisu u pitanju ni svi ostali neimenovani stanovnici Medvedgrada. Ovog puta taj osebujan lik je sam Medvedgrad. Medvedgrad je kao organizam koji na prvi pogled savr≈°eno dobro funkcionira. Iako se svaki od stanovnika grada nosi sa svojim standardnim problemima svakodnevice, kad je hokej u pitanju, graƒëani su slo≈æni; zlatno doba tek treba doƒái. Ali svaki organizam funkcionira dobro dok se ne otkrije onaj nesretni tumor koji ga polako ali sigurno nagriza, sve do potpunog uru≈°avanja. Samo ≈°to ovaj organizam ne zna kako bi se borio protiv njega i bi li se uopƒáe borio. Jer ono ≈°to mu je ispred nosa i jasno kao dan, Medvedgrad uporno odbija vidjeti i povjerovati u to, jer se kosi s onim ≈°to ga dr≈æi na ≈æivotu- hokejom! Tako slijepo dr≈æi leƒëa hokeju da se o≈°trica pravde, one drage gospoƒëe s povezom preko oƒçiju, usmjerava prema onima koji to najmanje zaslu≈æuju. Medvedgrad je veliki Backmanov izlazak iz komfor zone. Svi njegovi prija≈°nji romani tople su ljudske priƒçe s izuzetnim likovima koje pokazuju koliko je ≈æivot lijep unatoƒç povremenim gorkim zaƒçinima koje ima za nas. Medvedgrad je roman koji bi u vama mogao pobuditi sve one emocije koje Ove ili Bakica nisu pobudili; gaƒëenje, nevjerica i u konaƒçnici, bijes. Bijes zbog dogaƒëaja kojima kao ƒçitatelji svjedoƒçite; bijes zbog sljepoƒáe koja onemoguƒáava adekvatan odgovor na njih; bijes zbog nemoƒái. Nemoƒá koja bi posebno gorka mogla biti svim roditeljima kojima se Medvedgrad naƒëe u rukama. Navedeno dovodi do zakljuƒçka kako je Medvedgrad izrazito mraƒçan roman. Da, mraƒçan je, ali tako dobro pokazuje koliko je Backman u njemu sazreo, uhvativ≈°i se u ko≈°tac s potresnim i polarizirajuƒáim dru≈°tvenim problemima, kao ≈°to su vr≈°njaƒçko nasilje, silovanje, odnos prema migrantima i, naposljetku, neka≈ænjeni zloƒçini i odnos prema ≈ærtvama tih istih zloƒçina. Usprkos svemu navedenom, uspio je zadr≈æati onaj svoj peƒçat zbog kojeg ƒáete sa sjetom i toplinom oko srca okretati posljednju stranicu ovog romana. Za kraj ostaje mi samo odgovorno ustvrditi: Medvedgrad je najbolji roman koji je dosad iza≈°ao iz pera Fredrika Backmana. Iako je zakoraƒçio izvan svog uobiƒçajenog okvira pisanja osvrnuv≈°i se na neke gorke, uvijek aktualne dru≈°tvene probleme, uspio je zadr≈æati onu ƒçar koju su imali svi dosada≈°nji njegovi romani. Zbog svega navedenog ≈æeljno i≈°ƒçekujem drugi roman iz ciklusa Medvedgrad, Us Against You, za koji me jako zanima kojim ƒáe nas pravcem Backman dalje odvesti u istra≈æivanju gradiƒáa/organizma Medvedgrada."
300,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2195363-leslie,Rating 5 out of 5,"I should start this out by saying that I'm not a sports fan and that description is putting it mildly. Sports bore me. Usually when I start reading anything about them or watching them, my eyes glaze over and I tune out. This has been the greatest disappointment to my father who has been dragging me to Giants games my whole life. To this day, he has to bribe me with ice cream to get me to go. In other words, this usually wouldn't be my cup of tea. I'm so glad that I gave this book a chance though because it is so much more than a book about hockey. I haven't read Backman's other books besides, ""A Man Called Ove,"" and I will get to them because I own them all and I think he's terrific. But from what I've heard, this book is different from all of them. There isn't a grumpy protagonist at the heart of everything. There's a small town where hockey controls everything and holds the power. The hockey players are treated like kings, particularly the star player Kevin. So when an allegation of rape is made, it throws the whole town out of wack and creates a ripple effect on other issues brewing under the surface.  I don't know if the phrase, ""allegation of rape,"" is correct. To me, it was crystal clear that a rape happened. But for spoiler purposes, I didn't want to give things away. I'll try to think if there's a better way to say that. This book has many themes. Rape, sexuality, friendship, and even more but I can't think of everything right now. I couldn't help but think of the book Missoula: Rape and the Justice System in a College Town and if you've read that, you'll know why. What Backman's done that is similar to Ove is craft characters that will stay in my heart for a very long time. I will be thinking of Benji, Maya, Anna, Bobo, Amat, Sune, David, Kira and Peter for years to come. While many ends are tied up, there are lots of unfinished stories. Normally I would not be ok with this as I ended it desperate for more details about these people I had grown to love so much. However, when I went to hear Backman speak in June, he said he was almost done with a sequel to Beartown. I can hardly wait!I don't usually add personal stories to reviews but I'm going to do so with this one so you can skip over this last part if you'd like. It is a tad lengthy. I deliberately put it at the end so that people could read the book review first and continue on to this only if they felt like it. Part of the story DOES involve Fredrik Backman so it is somewhat related. I don't know about you guys, but so much of what I go through in life trickles down and becomes intertwined with what I'm reading. Or when I think about a book later or reread it later, I'll instantly remember what was happening to me back then. Separate from how beautiful this book is, with characters I'll never forget, I'll forever associate this book with Liz. I've been part of an online book group for the last fifteen years or so give or take a few years. I'm not exactly sure on the specific date I joined. We started out on the ivillage website and then when that shut down, we eventually migrated here to Goodreads and to a small Facebook group. The members live all across the US and we even have someone in Canada and one person in England. These women are my dear friends and I feel as close to them as many of my, ""in person,"" friendships. They have helped me through some hard times.Only one other person besides myself lived in California and that was Liz. Though she only lived two hours away or so, we had never managed to meet up. The lives of introverts right? But when Liz posted on Facebook that Fredrik Backman was coming to the Santa Rosa Library to speak and sign books, we were finally motivated enough to meet. I had loved, ""A Man Called Ove,"" with all my heart and it seemed like a great opportunity.It was such a fun night. We had dinner and strolled around downtown Santa Rosa and then went to the library. Backman was a delight. He was very funny in a dry way which is my favorite kind of funny. My author crush was tripled now. We stood in line after and he signed our books. Liz had a copy of Beartown. I had Beartown and Ove. We got pictures taken with him. I have one that I took at the exact moment she was telling him that it took him coming to California for us to meet after many years of online friendship. He was pretty amazed and his face lit up. He may have also thought we were kind of weird for waiting for so long. When I got in my car to go home, I made tentative plans with Liz to get together much sooner this time now that we had broken the ice. We discussed meeting in the middle to go to the outlets or to have lunch. We both said that we wished we had gotten together much sooner. I was so happy that she was just as kind, warm and funny as she seemed to be online.We did not get to meet again because just a week and one day later, I found out that Liz was gone. I tried not to be mad at myself for not meeting her sooner. Eventually I was just glad that I got a chance at all. Either way, I miss her. I saw that she had finished Beartown right before and that made me happy. She had been very eager to start it and I saw she had rated it five stars. I'm glad she got to finish it."

Hockey is just a silly little game. We devote year after year after year to it without every really hoping to get anything in return. We burn and bleed and cry, fully aware that the most the sport can give us, in the very best scenario, is incomprehensibly meager and worthless: just a few isolated moments of transcendence. That's all. But what the hell else is life made of?
I don't love hockey. I don't hate it. I am apathetic. I mumbled a weakhearted ""yay, good for them"" when our Washington Capitals finally claimed the Stanley Cup in 2018 after a 20-something-year draught of championships for the Metropolitan area. Yeah, all of the DC teams kind of...(suck). Luckily, no excess of tears, frustration, or disappointments for me because I really don't care about that stuff! But I am not apathetic and I definitely do care about this small group of Beartown inhabitants who have captured my own heart and soul with their extreme obsession over hockey.Why? Because Fredrik Backman is unrivaled in his capacity to express the human condition in words. This made A Man Called Ove one of my favorite books, and Beartown is no different. Do not mistake this as a story about just hockey; it is equally a compelling and skilled exploration of the convoluted gray areas encircling good versus evil, silence versus speaking up, and coming of age versus sheltering youth. All of that takes place in Beartown, a dying town in the middle of a snowy forest. There's one supermarket, jobs are dwindling, and roads are deteriorating. The townspeople know that the only hope of ever reclaiming Beartown's former glory and some much needed infusion of capital is for the junior hockey team to be claimed victor of the championship finals. But as Backman meticulously crafts achingly real backstories and glimmering future dreams for numerous community members with their intersectional identities‚Äîof teenagers, parents, hockey players, coaches, friends, colleagues, adults, kids‚Äîand the perspectives they offer, you come to realize that hockey has oh so many more consequences than you could ever imagine in a town. In what appears at first glance a quiet, near-forgotten town, Beartown is in truth a profound and memorable read that grabs onto your emotions and attention from the very beginning. I was alternately biting my nails or hyperventilating at the end of each chapter, dying to know what happened in some combination of fear, dread, anticipation, and excitement. Despite being much more heavily centered on teenagers in comparison to Backman's A Man Called Ove, this one is a much darker, less innocent departure. You are cut raw by emotions and torn by hard questions. Backman succeeds in boldly confronting humanity's capacity to justify or ignore evil, cruelty, and selfishness. But, as one can expect of this author, he is equally adept at championing goodness, compassion, and courage, proffering an uplifting and hopeful note through all the tears and despair. 
If you are honest, people may deceive you. Be honest anyway. If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfishness. Be kind anyway. All the good you do today will be forgotten by others tomorrow. Do good anyway.‚Äù
And somehow, for those of you who never loved hockey or sports in general, you will walk away not so much loving the sport but loving and respecting and understanding and hating the people who do. Mark my words, if I flip accidentally to hockey on a TV screen, I will assuredly and immediately turn it to a different channel, but Beartown and all its myriad emotions and memories will flash in my mind for a split-second before I turn away to a channel that satisfies my very normal, non-hockey-centered life."
302,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6942006-suzy,Rating 4 out of 5,"Update Jan 14, 2021: I follow Backman on InstaGram where he told us that the tv series based on this book debuts on HBO/HBO Max in the U.S. on Feb 22, 2021. I will definitely be tuning in!4++ starsBeartown is a story of loyalty, friendship, love, acceptance of self and others, courage, class, politics, culture and the good/bad/ugly of human beings, all set against the backdrop of an economically depressed, one-factory town in the dense woods of northern Sweden that has one thing going for it - hockey! We see how a town and its people can pin their hopes and self-worth on ""their team"" and how a sports team can both unite and divide. Backman is such a good writer with insight to the human condition that is way beyond his years. In Beartown, he creates memorable characters, including the town itself. I felt like I really knew the town and the townspeople, as if I lived there or nearby. (It wasn't hard to imagine since I live in Minnesota where there are many similarities - obsession with hockey, cold and ice, lots of Scandinavians and many towns that could be Beartown.) I previously read and loved A Man Called Ove and And Every Morning the Way Home Gets Longer and Longer, two very different books, but both touched my heart in a quiet, subtle way. Beartown has a lot more action in a shorter package than Ove and I was swept up in the drama of what would happen to the people, the team and the town. In the last third of the book, the writing becomes almost staccato, quickly shifting from person to person and setting to setting that had me breathless - in a good way! I wanted to know where this would all end up, but I had to slow down in the last hour of the audiobook because I didn't want to leave these people behind.I would have given Beartown 5 stars except that I wasn't as satisfied when all was said and done as I was with Ove. Here it seemed that the resolution of the central crisis of the book was too pat and the people behaved a little out of character to give us a more heartwarming ending. It feels a little like Backman had a movie deal in mind ala Friday Night Lights, but I can't picture a movie of Beartown being anything near as excellent as the movie of A Man Called Ove. (But with that said, if they do make a movie of Beartown, you can be sure I'll go see it :)))I can recommend this as another really good read in the Backman cannon with the above reservations and I heartily endorse the audiobook - excellent narration."
303,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11314204-cynthia-hamilton,Rating 4 out of 5," Beartown by Fredrik Backman is one of those books that completely engulf the reader. Right from the start, I could tell I was in good hands, that I was being led on a journey by a writer who knew what he was doing‚Äîa master storyteller, spinning a yarn‚Äîand all I had to do is sit back and enjoy the ride. I had no idea where the story was going to take me, as I usually don't read the blurbs. I remember thinking, okay‚Äîthis is a book about hockey players and a town that pretty much exists because of hockey, but it's well-written and has a lot of subplots going on, so I'll go with the flow. One act changed all that, and I didn't see it coming. After that pivotal moment, all the groundwork the author had laid came into play. It was all there, ready to dovetail and fall into place like a chain of dominos. Everyone who'd been introduced now flashed a different side of his or her character, be it a piece of personal history that slanted their take on events, or nuanced emotions to the gut-wrenching situation they now found themselves in. It would be almost impossible as a reader to not feel as torn as the players in this drama. There's so much at stake, and so many will be destroyed by the outcome, one way or the other.I take my hat off to this author. It's rare to come across a novel where every character is fleshed out in a way that they become instantly visible in the mind's eye, even though he doesn't go overboard with descriptions. He is a master at giving just the right details to sum up each person. Then he layers their personalities with flashbacks and secret moments of doubt and anguish. I give this book 4.5 stars, not because it is faulty in any way, but because it wasn't an easy journey for me as a reader. Fredrik Backman has the courage to write a tough book that embraces all life can dish out, without judging and without pulling punches. I really respect him for this and I will happily read more books by him. I feel a little conflicted about the rating, but I reserve 5 stars for those books that leave me with a warm glow in my heart. This book is an instant classic and deserves to be so, but it‚Äôs not an easy read, in that it takes the reader places that are far from comfortable."

This is my second book by Fredrik Backman and I have got to say, I highly enjoy his writing style. Both books that I have read by him so far, have had a bit of a slow start but his writing still intrigues me enough to want to continue. Honestly, this book had everything that a book needs to have to deserve a 5 star rating from me; - strong family relationships - strong female friendships <3 - great character development - important topics of discussion - impactful writing"
305,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28831526-jean,Rating 4 out of 5,"Let‚Äôs play HOCKEY! That‚Äôs the cry that signals the start of hockey games in the US, as I recall. As a high school and college student, I witnessed a few battles on the ice. Now, I guess I‚Äôve mostly outgrown it, mostly due to prevalence of fighting, I suppose. But when I picked up Fredrick Backman‚Äôs Beartown, and saw the word ‚Äúhockey‚Äù in the third sentence of the first chapter, a reference to the upcoming youth hockey semifinal game, I fully expected lots and lots of hockey action. Surprise! The actual game isn‚Äôt fought until, gee, about one-fourth of the way into the story! Yet, hockey permeates this book. Beartown, most of its residents feel, would be nothing without hockey. From the time they learn to walk, most boys learn to skate. (Some girls learn too, but there are no teams for girls.) Not long after that, they are picking up sticks and learning to handle and shoot a puck. Families of players are all in, most of them, that is. They drive their kids to practice, attend their games, and make sacrifices so that their kids, their players, can become the best. Every kid wants to be one of the Bears, the Bears from Beartown.Learning to skate, develop skills, build strength, power, and stamina, and blend with other players to form a cohesive unit takes time. I felt like the plot and character development of this book was much like that. At times, I found it hard to be patient, partly because the prologue foretells a terrible event, and then leaves the reader to ponder and wonder who, what, where, when, and why. There are so many characters ‚Äì the Anderssons ‚Äì Peter, who is the GM of the hockey club, his wife Kira, a lawyer, their 15-year-old daughter Maya, and their 12-year-old son. There are hockey coaches, Sune and David, teenage hockey players like Kevin from a wealthy family and Benji, his best friend, who is not wealthy. Then there is Amat, an immigrant kid who lives in ‚Äúthe Hollow‚Äù and skates like the wind. There is Maya‚Äôs best friend Ana, who spends most of her time at the Anderssons‚Äô home. Initially, there were too many names that made it hard to connect with any one individual. The story jumped from one person or family to another, showing slices of life in the small town. Was it effective? I suppose, because it eventually began to take shape, but it took me a long time to feel at ease with this story.When it does all begin to coalesce, things happen fast. There is hockey action! One criticism I have is that Backman‚Äôs third person omniscient narrator often tells rather than shows us what‚Äôs going on. He speaks, sometimes in clich√©s, sometimes much more eloquently, but also many times it seemed edifying, and there were moments when I wished he would refrain from instructing and just let a comment or an action sit there for the reader to consider. However, the hockey scenes made me feel like I was there in the crowd.The party afterward is where things go wrong. Up to this point, the setting could be Warroad, Minnesota, or Thunder Bay, Ontario, or any other small town in Sweden or a village in any other cold climate. Then it happens. It could happen anywhere. A party where teens and alcohol and hormones mix. A town that has been united by hockey is suddenly torn apart. What is unity? What is community? What is loyalty? What is courage, and what does it cost? Along with the shock comes blame. He said; she said. Blame the parents, the coaches; even blame hockey. It happens in high schools and colleges everywhere. People in the US and around the world know about the case of Brock Turner, the Stanford student athlete who got an extremely light sentence for felony sexual assault. This novel brought up feelings of anger and sadness for that victim and for women and men all over the world who have faced these situations. Don‚Äôt blame hockey. Don‚Äôt blame sports. Ramona says, ‚ÄúBlame the f*ing MEN!‚Äù Even that is oversimplification.Backman understands the culture that allows girls and women to become dehumanized. He portrays the female characters as both strong and vulnerable. His male characters are also both vulnerable and strong. His depictions show great perception and sensitivity. The thing is, in Beartown, no one really talks much. I‚Äôm not sure Beartown is all that different from small towns anywhere in that regard, or even large cities. The verses ‚Äì indeed, pieces of his writing are poetic ‚Äì capture the hearts and souls of the men and women as they struggle to raise their children and to protect them and of kids who scramble to fit in, to find their place, to learn, to love, to accept, to win, and to heal. He seems to get it, to really KNOW the intense fear of the dark that won‚Äôt go away‚Ä¶and finally - Bang! We know what the prologue teased us with nearly 400 pages earlier. And it's not quite what I expected. It's so much more.Beartown is an uncommonly good book. And no, you don‚Äôt have to be a hockey fan to love it.4.5 stars"

307,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4949011-sally906,Rating 5 out of 5,"Opens: Late one evening, toward the end of March, a teenager picked up a double-barrelled shotgun, walked into the forest, put the gun to someone else's forehead, and pulled the trigger. This is the story of how we got there.My Thoughts: Although the events before, during and after an ice hockey match are the bones that the story is pinned on ‚Äì the focus is NOT ice hockey. For which I was truly thankful because I know nothing about the game ‚Äì other than it looks very dangerous! No, the book‚Äôs focus is on the individual characters that are directly involved, and also on the emotions of the township as a whole ‚Äì this quote sums it up:‚Äú‚Ä¶Hate can be a deeply stimulating emotion. The world becomes easier to understand and much less terrifying if you divide everything and everyone into friends and enemies, we and they, good and evil. The easiest way to unite a group isn't through love, because love is hard, it makes demands. Hate is simple. So the first thing that happens in a conflict is that we choose a side, because that's easier than trying to hold two thoughts in our heads at the same time. The second thing that happens is that we seek out facts that confirm what we want to believe - comforting facts, ones that permit life to go on as normal. The third is that we dehumanize our enemy‚Ä¶‚ÄùThere is a diverse cast of characters and their different viewpoints are each recorded meticulously. Being a small isolated town in a remote area of Sweden the community of Beartown is tightly knit ‚Äì they all know each other, and pull together to survive. The upcoming ice hockey match is currently the sole focus of the town, with the expected win to potentially turn the town fortunes around.So, summed up, the hopes of the whole town all ride on the shoulder of one young star player. So when after a pre-match party he is accused of rape the focus of Beartown turns onto his alleged victim; she now becomes the only thing standing between Beartown finally declining and it‚Äôs rebirth as a society. You can imagine that sympathy is not a common thought towards her. The resulting furore becomes a catalyst for a very traumatic time for the community. With accusations and counter accusations flying; lies, innuendo and rumours being taken as fact ‚Äì the citizens of Beartown almost immediately start to show their true colours and the lines are drawn. But what is more important ‚Äì an ice hockey match or a human being? Friends become enemies, and enemies team up in a common cause. The many different actions taken are slowly woven together as each action causes a reaction that ripple-effects across the town and adds to the progress of the story. I became utterly engrossed as the story gradually unfolded.Beartown was an emotional rollercoaster for me as my reactions to the events and conversations triggered my mood to swing from happy to angry to upset and back to happy again ‚Äì sometimes in the same chapter! Often, the actions of the characters surprised me in how they reacted, especially when it was different to how I thought they should react. Beartown tackles some heavy issues - peer pressure, homophobia, rape culture and hero worship of sportsmen and women. All very current themes faced daily by different societies around the world.An edge of the seat story ‚Äì and, as I have said, an emotional rollercoaster that left me panting in exhaustion at the end.With thanks to Atria Books and the author via Netgalley for my copy to read and review."
308,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59633249-debsd,Rating 4 out of 5,"There's a problem with the Goodreads rating system, and I'm not talking about the ""only 5 stars, why can't we have 10"" complaints. I'm talking about how it wobbles between how good you think a book is, and how much you liked it. These are two completely separate things: quality and enjoyment are not the same thing or even necessarily related. Some enormously enjoyable reads aren't particularly deep, aren't especially well-written, don't say anything new or important - indeed, there might even be serious problems with a book which still provides reading enjoyment. 4* for ""really liked it""? Or 2* for ""it was ok""? (And what if it doesn't come up to ""ok""? I tend to strongly dislike poorly-written books, but some of them get good reviews from others.) And then there are books which address important subjects in hugely perceptive ways, or shine a new light on an important topic, or show astonishing writing skill, or which have characters so real that you miss them when you finish the book, but which are depressing, or cover subject matter which is intrinsically not pleasurable. 5* for ""it was amazing""? Or 1* for ""did not like it""?Beartown is one of those books. I cannot honestly say that I ""really liked"" a book about the rape of a young woman and the aftermath of that event. But it is a great book. Backman handles heavy subject matter in a sensitive way, within a clever format. This book demonstrates such a clear understanding of the perspectives of a wide range of characters, showing the humanity and frailty in all. This is wonderful story-telling with a strong impact.I picked this up because I had very much enjoyed other books by this author: A Man Called Ove and My Grandmother Sends Her Regards and Apologises. Like those, this offers many beautiful phrases - I highlighted too many sections to quote here - and has strong characterisation, but this book is driven more by events, and it is certainly much darker.Is it a book about sports? Yes and no. Backman uses ice-hockey as framework and analogy and certainly in the early part of the book, I wondered if I was getting as much out of it as I would if I had the least interest in ice-hockey. But it's about life, family, power, denial, strength, love. If this is a book about sports, then Backman should be applauded for getting me, with my near-absolute lack of interest in sports, to read and be awed by a book about sports.Note: I've read one or two reviews from readers who didn't find it credible that so much of the community stood behind Kevin, the boy who rapes Maya. To those, I'd respond: just look at what happens when celebrities - athletes, actors, directors - are accused of harassment, assault or worse. So many people stand by them and/or refuse to believe allegations despite ample evidence, sometimes even proof or admission of guilt. 2017 has been a year when a lot of powerful people have fallen, but in many of those cases, their abuse of power was known about and tolerated for many years - and in other cases, they are still directing, acting, playing, presidenting..."

2020 review

""Bitterness can be corrosive; it can rewrite your memories as if it were scrubbing a crime scene clean, until in the end you only remember what suits you of its causes.""
I am utterly incapable of a speaking single syllable right now. Quite possibly my new favorite book of all time.So, before I break down, I will write a very short but hopefully proper review. The most observable strength of this book is definitely the writing. Fredrik Backman will absolutely astound you with the way he crafts a sentence into a masterpiece. You can tell by reading any chapter in this book that the words spill straight from his heart onto the page. And the result is pure beauty.Once you get over the writing, other things start to hit you. Such as the flawed and endearing characters. The characters in this book are so three-dimensional, so complex, so human that I was entirely too close to screaming out in delight, because that is a very rare thing to find in books nowadays. The story, at its core, is about a small town deep in the woods in Sweden called Beartown. Life in Beartown revolves around the sport of ice hockey, and the people in this town have stacked all their hopes of becoming a bigger town onto the shoulders of the boys in their junior ice hockey team. The team is about to compete in the finals, and the entire town is buzzing with excitement. Little does anyone know about the horrors to come that will cause a young girl's entire universe to come crashing down. And it couldn't have been told in a better way. There was no sugar-coating. There was no shying away from difficult subjects, such as rape. It was all so raw. And that is part of why I loved it so much. It was so obvious that this book was written by a person understands humans in a way few others do, acknowledges their beauties but also their shortcomings, their joys but also their sorrows, their good but also their bad.I have so much respect for Fredrik Backman.trigger warnings: rape, sexual assault, victim blaming, strong language, drinking, violence‚ûº 5 stars"
310,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4739465-monica,Rating 4 out of 5,"Beartown was an excellent read. Backman's characters feel real and though this is the only book I've read by him so far; I'm putting him on a very exclusive shelf with Marlon James as a male who creates authentic and substantive female characters. I found two unicorns in 2020!! I'm going to keep this review short. Beartown is about a dying town, sports obsessed with hockey and all of the human behaviors that make it run. The book is a character study showcasing a pretty broad range of human emotions and motivations and viewpoints. And it is very thoughtful. All of the personalities are strong, some of the characters are extremely substantive. The readers understand who they are and why they behave the way they do. This is the kind of book that sticks with you and has far more meaning beyond the plot and the conclusion.The book is very white. A remote Scandinavian town with events taking place in the dead of winter with the snow piled high among the monochromatic population. Not every book is meant to be diverse. The book appears to be true to what it purports. I had a couple of issues: Maya was just a little too much. Too wise, too clear-headed, too worldly, too mature, too bold, too certain, too well-adjusted for a 15 year old. Also all of the characters were just a little too good. Maybe I'm very cynical but these characters were capable of deep introspection and I just don't think that is indicative of the average person...or am I judging by American standards? Because there was only one character that did not do some soul searching and that was the uber wealthy father of Kevin. Simplistic: extremely wealthy/big business=bad; everybody else=good deep down. I feel so jaded, but I'm just too old and seen too much to be utterly charmed by this book. But in all honesty, I enjoyed it immensely and the choice of a female narrator for a novel ostensibly about hockey seems bold; but Marin Ireland knocked it out of the park (sorry for the cross sports metaphor)!! There is definitely more Backman in my future. At a minimum the sequel Us Against You. But I see myself going beyond the minimum in this case. He's a terrific storyteller!!4+ StarsListened to the audiobook. Marin Ireland is brilliant!!"

I am speechless and shocked and in awe etc etc. I had the time of my life reading Beartown: a chilly, honest examination of a small, poor town whose future rests on the shoulders of the local teenage hockey team. Unlike Backman's previous works, which focus on one (sometimes two, but usually) one character, Beartown features a large cast. I was very thrown off by this at first, as I'd become used to Backman's style; he really changes it up here. It took fifty or so pages for me to get a handle on all the characters, but once I did I really enjoyed the ride. All these people are endlessly fascinating to read about--they harbor grudges and secrets and hopes; Backman writes about the powerful, underdogs, and everyone in between with precision and raw skill. Topics such as homosexuality, the alluring power of groupthink, small town politics, rape culture, and parenthood are handled with surprising ease and dignity. Backman is a master of misdirection: he leads his readers in one direction, only to reveal it's all a fake out and, instead, takes them to a much more fulfilling place. Sorry, fanboying here. I just really love this author, okay? Beartown is a fabulous novel. It's a relentless tour de force. I couldn't find anything to complain about if I tried. I don't even like hockey, but the author made it not only interesting ‚Äî he actually had me on the edge of my seat during the game scenes. That's a feat in itself! Highly recommended to any and all readers. This is slightly different from his previous work, and I welcome the change. An author has to grow to survive. I cannot wait to see what Backman publishes next! (I'd also like to show my appreciation for Neil Smith, who translated this fine novel from the original Swedish to English. Great job!)"
312,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4984609-sandi,Rating 4 out of 5,"One of the things that will make a whole community ""group think"" is sports. Group think ~ A process of reasoning or decision-making by a group.  That definition does not say that the reasoning or decision-making will be positive. You see just as much negative group think as positive. The community of Beartown weathered both positive and negative. Beartown is a small community like most. It had a wealthy section and a poor section. The overall community was dying and the major players of the community wanted growth and recognition. The thing that brought these two sections of people together was the ice rink - Beartown Hockey - the teenage boys who played their hearts out. We follow a number of hockey players and their families - from both sides of town. The teenagers currently playing and also the men who had played the sport - both those still involved with the rink and those no longer involved. Backman took us deep within family and what that means and where that lays in the heart of each man. He did not mince any words or situations when it came to family life or it's trauma. He highlighted the things that drive any particular man and makes it appear that family is not his main concern. And he also brought family to the forefront as the most important thing in a mans life. Depending on the situation - and there are many situations in this story, both positive and negative - the families in this novel either grew or regressed. The community mentality either ebbed or flowed. As the story concludes a solution is found. Maybe not ideal, but one that most could live with. Each man and family had to make their own decision. Hockey was still the main sport and motivation, however group think was not as prominent as it once had been. "
313,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6526961-deacon-tom-f,Rating 5 out of 5,"A Bang Bang Bang Masterpiece‚ÄúBeartown by Fredrik Backman was an intense story that I thoroughly enjoyed, Backman‚Äôs writing is superb with vivid detail; multiple subplots and precise descriptions. As a hockey fan, I was captured right away and the story builds to where I was left fully immersed in the small town culture of Beartown.So many situations are expressed in the book. After seminal moment in the books captures the plot and spins it beyond a pure hockey story. There's so much at stake, and so many lives can be destroyed by the possible outcomes. All done masterfully. The passionate way he described the feelings and emotions were highpoints of this book. From the pain of abuse, to date rape and eventually revengeful behavior that has as many perspectives like one looks at the plot through a prism. I associated closely with this book. I experienced my personal coming of age in a small borough that was basketball crazy. Because I didn't go to the local school, I luckily only observed many of these uncultured behaviors. Many like the bar crowd continue today--a few still sit on the same barstool. The overall excellence of the storytelling and how he wove the many personalities with flashbacks, current action and finally future views was outstanding. I highly recommend this storytelling masterpiece. "

Besides, the POVs are written in short sketches and we have no time to get bored. My feelings while reading it were not good. A doomed feeling surrounded me, like I borrowed the cloud from Adam's family and kept it with me until the end.That said, I cannot let this feeling affect my rate because the writing carried enough power to pull me into the story even when I was trying not to, even when I was trying to protect myself from feeling what I didn't want to feel, a sense of powerlessness in the face of injustice, bullying and closed minds.Hence the solid 4 Stars."

""What you create, others can destroy. Create anyway. Because in the end,it is between you and God. It was never between anyone else anyway. ""

It took me some time to get into the story. The pace was quite slow but every single detail felt relevant. At last, when I was able to blend into the story, I just couldn't put the book down. I forgot to sleep last night and finished this book. It was mesmerizing and amazing.My favourite thing about the entire book was the characters. There were so many, (more than 20??). And they all were important in building the story. The book was an entire rollercoaster of emotions. I was moved and captivated. Every single character seemed so real that I just couldn't help thinking that I was a part of 'Beartown'. (Do I need to tell you how much I cried. My eyes were really swallowed. üòÖüòÖüòÖ)"

The problem now is how can I possibly find another book to read that will even come close to the awesomeness of this novel? This is not a hockey book, this is a book about life, about children, about parents, about adults, and most importantly about finding out who you really are and about finding your place in this crazy world that we live in. The characters, the writing, the theme all came together to make this an outstanding piece of fiction. "

It‚Äôs such an important commentary on how we view this situation and who gets a ‚Äúpass‚Äù and how that‚Äôs not ok. I loved the different characters and how the situation affected everyone. I found myself infuriated and cheering at times and overall sad at how true this story can be. I loved every word and there‚Äôs were so many quotes that hit me hard.

320,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126347706-zo,Rating 3 out of 5,"TW for rape/SANow I won‚Äôt be retracting any of my previous ‚ÄúFredrik Backman can do no wrong‚Äù statements, but ‚ÄòBeartown‚Äô is definitely my first book of his that I‚Äôve had a hard time enjoying. A big reason I didn‚Äôt love this one was because I identified a bit TOO much with the story, and therefor picked it to pieces until it was no longer enjoyable. I, like Maya, was sexually assaulted at 15 and also faced the repercussions of rape culture, so to say it hit close to home would be an understatement (yes, I knew what the story was about before reading, I just wasn‚Äôt prepared for our circumstances to be so similar and usually am not triggered easily so I thought I would be fine).I‚Äôm glad this book exists for others to understand stories like mine and approach them with more empathy, but as for the victims of the crime depicted in the book? Not so much. Personally, I would not recommend this to anyone who has went through SA, especially if you are experiencing PTSD. One of my biggest pet peeves in media surrounding rape is how hopeless victims are portrayed, and that was unfortunately very present in ‚ÄòBeartown‚Äô. After Maya is assaulted, it‚Äôs brought up continuously how she‚Äôll never really recover, will always be afraid of the dark, etc., and while I think Backman wrote those lines (with nothing but good intentions) to try to ingrain in the reader how terrible rape is; the prospect of one day recovering from that trauma shouldn‚Äôt diminish the horror of it. Yes, sexual assault is among the worst things someone can go through, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be a lifelong wound. I‚Äôm so grateful to be living in a time where issues like this can be openly discussed, and at the same time, I don‚Äôt think the amount of dispair that surrounds survivors is productive to the conversation!! It sounds corny, but whoever said ‚Äúthere is a light at the end of the tunnel‚Äù was kinda right, and I‚Äôve started making my way towards it :‚Äô)VAGUE/MINOR SPOILERS IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPHSAnother thing that I disliked about this book was that climactic ending. Fredrik Backman‚Äôs finales typically tie together perfectly and have a sort of full-circle moment, and while it usually works for me, this one just didn‚Äôt. Something about the whole eye-for-an-eye / trauma-for-trauma situation just wasn‚Äôt satisfying to me, not saying it wasn‚Äôt warranted (!!!) but‚Ä¶ yeah I don‚Äôt know, there really isn‚Äôt a gratifying way to wrap up a story that deals with topics as heavy as rape.However, I did appreciate how Kevin was written as a fully fledged human being, and not just as a cookie-cutter villain like most sexual offenders in media are portrayed. I don‚Äôt think a lot of people really internalize the fact that rapists are everyday people; your neighbors, your coworkers, even your friends or family members. Is this a scary thought? Absolutely, but if we remove perpetrators of their nuance and reduce them to black-and-white we strip them of their humanity, which makes us stray even farther from solving the issue at hand. Props to the author for not taking that route!SPOILERS OVERAll issues aside, this is Fredrik Backman we‚Äôre talking about; I could have infinite issues with his story and it would still be readable and engaging, simply because he wrote it. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll continue on with the series any time soon, but if I do, it will be for Benji and Amat (my sons, actually). Definitely not my favorite of his works or one I would recommend to everyone, but I still think ‚ÄòBeartown‚Äù is an important story and am happy that it‚Äôs out there."

FB writes so so beautifully and captivatingly. you cannot help but fall in love with these characters. "
322,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49089020-sharon-metcalf,Rating 5 out of 5,"I loved this book. Many would say that Beartown by Fredrik Backman is about hockey but please don't be deterred if you are not a hockey fan. In the sub tropical city I live in ice hockey is almost unheard of. I don't know the first thing about the sport but that doesn't matter in the least. Sure the book is about a town that lives and breathes hockey. It is the blood that pumps through the town's veins. It's everywhere and it's vital to life in Beartown, but hockey is not all there is to this story. It's about the people in the community, how they deal with each other, the things they do and don't do based upon their past experiences. It's about people doing what you let them get away with.Beartown is a forestry town in sharp decline. Some say you can't live in this town, only survive it. The Bears Junior team has been training hard for years and are on the cusp of winning a major championship. The town's fortunes are hanging on this outcome and winning is the only acceptable option.  "" There are no almosts in hockey."" WIN!! is what these boys are told. In their club there are posters and pennants that read  Culture. Values. Community.. Without giving away any plot points it's fair to say one event shakes the town to the core and the words on those posters are thrown into question. People's values are tested. The culture of the club is put into question and the community is divided. Morals and motivations are put under the spotlight. Right versus wrong. Loyalty, courage, truth and lies, secrets, trust and betrayals. They're some of the big issues this book forces you to think upon. Fedrik Backman puts readers in the shoes of the characters in this town, some loveable, some not so much, all with human flaws, fears and frailties. These characters, this book is the stuff of life and it's so relatable regardless of whether you're from a hockey town or not. "" There are no almosts in hockey."" and the same can be said of Fredrik Backman's writing. He gives his all and we, the reading public, are the ones that benefit. Excuse me now while I go and start on the sequel. "

Too many characters to juggle (too hard to tell the difference between Bobo and Benji, e.g.), stereotypical characters ( crusty old lady bar owner with a heart comprised of a moral compass; a grandfatherly figure who sees the souls of young athletes as moldable & golden), the requisite gay character hiding his truth from everyone including himself, the one-dimensional glory-bound local sports star with no boundaries or conscience, the power-mongering hockey dad with no first name---ugh.

It does start off obsessed with it but trust me it could be a metaphor for anything. However, it will take you the first 30 to 50 pages to believe it. Regardless, the writing is so superb you will read it anyway. As the story develops there are subtle hints, so you get an idea the direction this tale may turn. Stil I found it almost shocking. This is a novel, this is literary fiction. I would have given it 5 stars, but I was disappointed in the ending (my opinion), I don't want to say anything more about it because I dont want to give even a tiny bit of a spoiler. 4.3 stars"
