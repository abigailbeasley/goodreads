0,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma,Rating 5 out of 5,"welcome to...MIDDLEMARCH MARCH. this book is a calm cool and collected 880 pages long, so elle and i will be tackling three chapters a day...every day for this whole month.join us as we melt our minds. i love a project!DAY 1: CHAPTERS 1-3immediately i am having fun. approx 30 pages per day for 31 days currently seems like the perfect way to read a book, i am walking on sunshine, i am breathing rainbows or whatever.this is beautifully written and a whole blast. i'm gonna live forever.DAY 2: CHAPTERS 4-6somehow i have been cursed with reading not one, but two books about the devil's work on earth (beautiful twenty-something women marrying random dudes in their 40s) at the same time.gotta give it up, though: i'm not even at the 10% mark and i'm invested enough to do all but scream NOOOO at the pages.DAY 3: CHAPTERS 7-9listen to this roast: ""He has got no good red blood in his body [...] Somebody put a drop under a magnifying-glass, and it was all semicolons and parentheses.""insanely good.i like this will ladislaw character!DAY 4: CHAPTERS 10-12there's like a full page of dialogue in this about how dumb men look playing the flute and in other words i think i am in love with this book.DAY 5: CHAPTERS 13-15i could read about rosy for 100 years. i could read about dodo for 50 years. i could read about will for 25 years. i am reaching the end of my patience with mr. old man husband and dr. boring guy.DAY 6: CHAPTERS 16-18for the first time thus far, i almost missed a day.you may be tempted to say ""emma, it hasn't even been a week, how are you already almost missing days"" and to that i would respond a) i'm doing a WHOLE OTHER PROJECT right now and b) i'm lazy.technically it's 1:19 a.m. and thereby i did miss a day, but i ascribe to my own calendar, which is whenever i'm awake it's one day and then when i go to bed and wake up it becomes the next.this was very trying (three in a row of the more town politics-y chapters) but i did it in spite of dawning sleepiness.DAY 7: CHAPTERS 19-21AND WE'RE BACK TO DODO AND LADISLAW!that sounds like a truly unlistenable indie band.anyway, after all those chapters about chaplaincies and town doctors, it's a treat beyond words to read about these two again. speaking of treat beyond words, i just remembered i have Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate-Covered Cherries™️...hang on, middlemarch. let me get my priorities in order. oh man i'm having so much fun. 1,000 pages of dodo and ladislaw dialogue, please and thanks.DAY 8: CHAPTERS 22-24i've straight up been looking forward to this since i put it down yesterday. i don't want to jinx anything buuuuut...if this level of fun keeps up we may just have a 5 star on our hands.we have now entered Book 3, which has the cheery and promising title ""Waiting for Death."" i'm in heaven.DAY 9: CHAPTERS 25-2727 is my favorite number. just a fun fact.this fred vincy character sure is a ding-dong, and a bit of a jerkoff to boot.chapter 26 uses the phrase ""to be caught tripping,"" a moment which i imagine is what people mean when they say a timeless classic.DAY 10: CHAPTERS 28-30wow. can you believe it! almost a third done already. time flies when you're assigning books to yourself like homework.relatedly: best homework ever. this rules. DAY 11: CHAPTERS 31-33anyone else as stunned as i am that i haven't yet missed a day? if you aren't you should be. do not believe in me.a cliffhanger!!!!!!!!DAY 12: CHAPTERS 34-36we are now entering book 4: three love problems.my guesses for the three titular issues in question:1) Dodo's Old Man Husband Is The Worst And His Young Artist Cousin Rules2) Mary Garth Deserves Better Than Fred Vincy But Will Probably End Up With Him3) Somehow Middlemarch's Hottest Single Is Engaged To Some Poor Guy. No Thanks, As A Readernext book is called ""THE DEAD HAND,"" very ominously, and we're getting some foreshadowing as to what that means here on the day of featherstone's funeral.technically that's a spoiler but i don't think ""oldest character dying in a sprawling 1000 page novel"" is much of a twist.already today is so long and i'm not even halfway through the first of the three chapters but!!! ""There would be a satisfaction in being buried by Mr. Cadwallader, whose very name offered a fine opportunity for pronouncing wrongly if you liked.""this is so funny. and i haven't even mentioned yet that there's an oft-referenced place called Freshitt.okay and: “I dare say Dodo likes it: she is fond of melancholy things and ugly people.” me using dating apps.DAY 13: CHAPTERS 37-39okay. i am suddenly multiple days behind.in my defense: on sunday i took medical leave of reading (so scared of slumping again) and yesterday i was equal parts busy and anxious, and thereby effectively illiterate.but the good news is: today is a 9 chapter day!!! (it is really a reflection of how much fun i'm having that this is good news, instead of the sickening impact of procrastination.)""Each looked at the other as if they had been two flowers which had opened then and there."" golly.this is a very witty and smart and beautifully written book, and the nicest thing i can say about it is that there are approx 100,000 characters and i'm not having that much trouble remembering them. huge praise.DAY 14: CHAPTERS 40-42haha. chapter xl.“The lad is of age and must get his bread.” was this published YESTERDAY? i'm losing my damn mindcurrent character ranking:1) dodo2) will3) rosamond4) mary5) fred6) celiaany of these guys as the focus: good with me. when we open up a chapter and i see the dreaded word ""lydgate""...a different story!DAY 15: CHAPTERS 43-45as very witty people in the comments pointed out: IT'S THE MIDDLE OF MIDDLEMARCH MARCH. the ides, even.it is also now BOOK V: THE DEAD HAND, a badass title that only grows more badass because of the aforementioned foreshadowing.nothing is more badass than foreshadowing.I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. ROSAMOND IS SUDDENLY LIVING WITH AND MARRIED TO AND ACQUAINTED WITH THE FAMILY OF LYDGATE. WHAT THE HELL KIND OF PACING IS THIS. NARY A SINGLE WEDDING SCENE IN THIS DAMN BOOK IN WHICH 3 WEDDINGS HAVE TAKEN PLACE AMONG MAJOR CHARACTERS.casaubon and lydgate can be exiled from this book, as far as i'm concerned, for their respective crimes of being a butthole and being boring.DAY 16: CHAPTERS 46-48it's the best time of the day!will ladislaw, a pro-union pro-democracy king. also the first recorded instance of a floor person.this is also such a perfect example of the Every Good Heterosexual Romance Involves The Man Liking The Woman Way More. i'm once again having a blast.I JUST GASPED AT THE END OF THIS CHAPTER. OH LA VACHE.DAY 17: CHAPTERS 49-51i love this book so much (reading it earlier in the day than usual for i can't wait reasons) but it is SO FRUSTRATING SOMETIMES. when a once-major character has a baby I DON'T WANT TO FIND OUT THROUGH A PASSING LINE OF DIALOGUE.jeez. tangled webs here in middlemarch.DAY 18: CHAPTERS 52-54ugh! i like the vicar better for mary than dumb old fred vincy. sure, he's 5th in my character rankings, but i rank, like, the mad hatter pretty highly too. doesn't mean i'd wanna marry the guy.was just thinking ""ah, don't know if i have a long bulstrode section in me..."" and then after two paragraphs this book straight up says ""enough."" i'm in loveaaaaand onto book 6: THE WIDOW AND THE WIFE. ok. three months have suddenly just passed without will and dodo even glimpsing each other, meanwhile if i go like 10 days without seeing someone i'm dating i assume we're ghosting each other.how times have changed.goddamn i am yearning! this book is so f*ckin' good.DAY 19: CHAPTERS 55-57okay. so i missed a day. in my defense i was drunk for like 90% of the friday to saturday block of this week, for reasons of ""It Was 70 Degrees And St Patrick's Day Weekend And I Am Young And Hot.""aaaand i missed another day. i read one chapter but i was very hungover and had also drunkenly bought basketball tickets so time was limited.8 chapter day it is!!!some fun mary and fred action happening. maybe i will have time to turn Team Fred before the end of this.DAY 20: CHAPTERS 58-60immediately this set started out by saying lydgate hates his cousin because his haircut is lame. maybe i'll do a 180 on lydgate, too, because that f*ckin rules.oh my god and it says the same cousin isn't actually hot but girls think he is because of his mustache. i love that this million year old book has the same opinions as the average tiktoker.oh my god and: “If he got his head broken, I might look at it with interest, not before.” PLEASEthis project is really testing my roman numeral reading ability.DAY 21: CHAPTERS 61-63oh man. drama alert.oh god. chapter 61: drama. chapter 62: yearning. onto BOOK 7: TWO TEMPTATIONS.ugh. i was trying so hard to like lydgate but him being an asshole immediately on the heels of a perfect dodo / will chapter is too much to bear. DAY 22: CHAPTERS 64-66read over 100 pages of this yesterday. now i feel invincible going in for what will surely be, like, 22.rosamond is a complete and utter b*tch and i love it.DAY 23: CHAPTERS 67-69hehe.this was like...all bulstrode. rude.DAY 24: CHAPTERS 70-72ugh. more bulstrode. at least he's doing crimes.and i guess we have to kill the time somehow until will and dodo can see each other again.onto book eight: SUNSET AND SUNRISE.it's giving ethan hawke.“And, of course, men know best about everything, except what women know better.” so true bestieDAY 25: CHAPTERS 73-75oh thank god, will ladislaw is coming back. i can't deal with all this bulstrode and lydgate action, even if i do keep getting the opportunity to see rosy be an absolutely divine asshole because of it.DAY 26: CHAPTERS 76-78this set of chapters is so dramatic that i just explained the entire plot of this 900 page book to my sister just to try to indicate the massive yearning angsty payoff of dodo and will seeing each other again under unintended circumstances.i am having so much fun it's hard to stop!!!DAY 27: CHAPTERS 79-81I AM GOING THROUGH IT, EMOTIONALLY SPEAKING.DAY 28: CHAPTERS 82-84AAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!honestly in my heart of hearts i find this kinda anticlimactic but still.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!actually i take it back. it's nice just the way it is.DAY 29: CHAPTERS 85-87folks, we are nearing the end and i have to say...I DON'T WANNA.don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened, or whatever, i guess, ugh.also now realizing it's been about a hundred years since we last heard from fred and mary. we're down to the last seconds, george eliot!thereeee they are.all the star crossed dodo-and-will stuff is lovely, but this is so good too: ""I don’t think either of us could spare the other, or like any one else better, however much we might admire them. It would make too great a difference to us—like seeing all the old places altered, and changing the name for everything."" and it's over. i didn't know it was finishing today!!! i'm going to cry.OVERALLthis is a funny, wry, smart, witty, political, historically significant, educating, romantic, beautifully written, basically perfect book.it is worth each and every one of its 880 pages and i would have kept reading far more!rating: 5-------------------tbr reviewam very into pretending i want to read super-long books lately"
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/345211-stephanie,Rating 5 out of 5,"I'm thoroughly embarrassed to admit that this book was first recommended to me by my stalker. Subsequently, I avoided MIDDLEMARCH like the plague, because it became associated with this creepy guy who thought the fastest way to my heart was to stare at me, follow me home, and leave obscene messages on my voice mail. Flash forward 2 years, when I'm purusing yet another of my favorite tomes, THE BOOK OF LISTS. I'm intrigued to see that the one book that consistently turns up on the ""Ten Favorite Novels"" list of various authors is -- you guessed it -- MIDDLEMARCH. With recommendations from James Michener, Ken Follett, and William Trevor, I figured this was a book worth reading.What a beautiful surprise. Nobody depicts the depth and breath of society better than George Elliot. She shows both how people are shaped by their times and vice-versa. Add to this an intriguing story of Dorothea Brooke, a well-meaning woman who wants to make a positive mark on the world. Despite her best intentions, Dorothea soon learns that the world will go on, with or without her help. This book is a sobering lesson for dreamers like myself who are always pondering, ""How can I make a difference?"" After reading MIDDLEMARCH, I suspect George Elliot would answer, ""Stop taking yourself so seriously and get on with your life. Nobody wants your help, so mind your own business!!"" A refreshing attitude, particularly in this self-important culture.So, long story short: If someone starts stalking you, change your phone number. File a complaint with human resources. Get a restraining order. But before you do, be sure to ask el nutjob for some book and movie recommendations. Because chances are, after obsessively watching your every move, this freak probably knows you better than you know yourself. "
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7574349-melanie,Rating 5 out of 5,"Oh, the slow burn of genius.I always tread lightly when it comes to using the word ""genius"" but there is no way around it here.It took me a good 200 pages to fully get into the novel and its ornate 19th-century turn of phrase but very quickly, I was so completely spellbound by its intelligence and wisdom that I couldn't put it down.George Eliot's astonishing authorial voice is something to behold. It takes the (mis)adventures of a handful of characters and peels their layers one by one with so much subtlety that you often have to reread a sentence several times to fully grasp the keenness of its observations.The entire novel feels like a giant lens zooming in and out of human follies with such gusto and empathy that you cannot help but feel privileged to witness the inner workings of people's thoughts and (re)actions. Not only does ""Middlemarch"" make you ponder many aspects of our motivations, desires, aspirations, limitations, ideals, dreams, behavior and inclinations but it keeps you on the edge of your seat like a ferocious psychological thriller.The end will leave you teetering on the brink, revisiting all of your personal, deep-seated assumptions about people, what is a successful life, what is a good marriage, how you measure goodness and your impact on others' lives.A work of vertiginous beauty."
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/132196-siobhan,Rating 5 out of 5,"Best. Goddamned. Book. Ever.Seriously, this shit's bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S. 750 pages in, and you're still being surprised. It's 800 pages long and EVERY SINGLE PAGE ADVANCES THE PLOT. You cannot believe it until you read it. This is a writer's book. By which I mean, and I say this with love, that if you write, but you do not love Middlemarch with everything that's in you, then stop writing. Yesterday."
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline,Rating 1 out of 5,"Page 97:Ugh. I'm trying, guys, I really am. But right now I'm about 100 pages into this book, and the thought of getting through the next 700 is making me want to throw myself under a train. And I almost never leave a book unread, so this is serious. However, since it's on The List, I feel I should at least try to give it another chance. But it's not going to be easy.Here, in simplified list form, are the reasons I really, really want to abandon this book: -It's everything I hate about Austen - boring dialogue and background information, endless nattering on about who's marrying whom - with none of the dry wit that makes her stories enjoyable. -Dorothea is an insufferable, stuck-up know-it-all and I hate her. Also, her sister calls her ""Dodo"" in a horribly misguided attempt at affection, and every time I have to read it it's like a cheese grater to the forehead. -She's nineteen years old and is marrying a forty-seven year old. I...I just can't. I know it's going to end badly which makes it slightly better but come on, Eliot. -Simply put, I don't care. I don't care about these characters. I don't care about their boring lives. I don't care who marries whom and who is happy or not happy, and I really don't care about Dorothea's stupid cottage designs. -I get the sense that none of the things I listed are going to change. I'm strongly sensing that the next 700 pages of this book are going to be the same exact stuff about marriage and unhappiness and Dodo and blah blah blaaaaahhhhh. Unless something really interesting is going to happen, I don't think I can keep going. At this point, it would take a zombie uprising at Middlemarch to make me invested in these characters and their lack of struggle. Page 190:Okay, I need to get to Part 5 before I can reasonably stop reading. Hopefully something resembling a plot will happen soon. Page 300:Nope. Nothin' yet.Page 370:OH MY GOD I DON'T CARE I DON'T CARE SHUT UP SHUT UP WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME ALL OF THIS GEORGE ELIOT WHHHHHHHYYYYYYYPage 409:Okay. I tried. No one can say I didn't give this book a fair chance. But I'm halfway through and NOTHING HAS HAPPENED. I just read 400 pages of some boring people going about their boring everyday business, and I'm DONE. Maybe I'm just not sophisticated enough to understand this book's genius. Maybe I can only be happy with a book if the characters are likeable and doing interesting things besides sitting around and thinking about how fucking miserable they all are. Maybe it's just my fault for having a bad attitude about this book from the beginning. Who knows. But what I know for sure is this: I got to my designated halfway point on the flight back from vacation, and when we landed I made sure to leave Middlemarch on the plane. Hopefully it's adopted by someone who will love it more than I did. ADDENDUM: I just consulted The List to check this book off, and I decided to see if there were any other George Eliot books on it. Including Middlemarch, there are five Eliot books I'm supposed to read before I die. FIVE. Goddamn it. "
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22848274-ilse,Rating 5 out of 5,"Some discouragement, some faintness of heart at the new real future which replaces the imaginary, is not unusual, and we do not expect people to be deeply moved by what is not unusual. That element of tragedy which lies in the very fact of frequency, has not yet wrought itself into the coarse emotion of mankind; and perhaps our frames could hardly bear much of it. If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel’s heart beat, and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence. As it is, the quickest of us walk about well wadded with stupidity.When Alexandra suggested to participate in this year’s alphabetical challenge of reading women, I admit the prospect of finally reading Middlemarch for the ‘E’ was the decisive element for me to embark on the journey –and I had been keeping the novel aside as a precious reward, to be touched if and only if I would manage to finish a demanding work project in time. When that blissful moment came, I couldn’t have dreamt of a more exquisite treat than reading this masterpiece, of which I enjoyed every minute. Although Virginia Woolf called it ‘one of the few English novels written for grown-up people’ reading this novel made me feel sixteen again, catapulting me back into memories of spending hours of reading delight during school holidays in the small kitchen above the grocery store where my mother worked, only having to interrupt reading to wash the dishes, then plunging again into some fat Russian 19th century novel, greedily gobbling up the sentences, floating on cloud nine. Isn’t it odd how memory singles out and connects to some of our experiences as the most delightful ones of our lives, of which we were barely aware when we were living them? Needless to say books which are that overwhelming are rare, and this novel is such one, one that swallowed me whole, only desiring to be in the book, curling up with the characters – I revelled in Eliot’s prowess in bringing to life her wondrous characters and particularly in the strength of her women (most of the men in the novel seem no match for the women, at certain moments some sound like a tenor in an opera who’s faint voice renders his nonetheless beautiful lines and alleged heroism at times perhaps somewhat implausible but all the more human). As so much has been written on this magnum opus (I so far have only skimmed through a few of the magnificent hymns readers here have written to this so well-loved book and hope to read them more thoroughly now having finished the novel) and the issues worth analysing seem boundless – I feel it could easily feed my reading group’s discussions for a year - reading the novel a first time I soon sensed it out of my league to consider writing anything about it and so surrendered to reading instinctively, plunging in naked and unarmed, floating smoothly on Eliot’s fabulous sentences, the gentle waves of her wisdom. If I would focus on one theme for further exploring in a second read it would be marriage as seen by Eliot, to find out if and in which way her views concurred with or differed from the conventional ones in her time, and what her views on relationships tell us today. Young love-making—that gossamer web! Subtle interlacings are swung— are scarcely perceptible: momentary touches of fingertips, meetings of rays from blue and dark orbs, unfinished phrases, lightest changes of cheek and lip, faintest tremors. The web itself is made of spontaneous beliefs and indefinable joys, yearnings of one life towards another, visions of completeness, indefinite trust. And Lydgate fell to spinning that web from his inward self with wonderful rapidity. As for Rosamond, she was in the water-lily’s expanding wonderment at its own fuller life, and she too was spinning industriously at the mutual web.One of the themes which propulses the finely spun narratives and intrigues (Middlemarch has been compared to an intricate emotional spider web, the omniscient authorial voice repeatedly using the web metaphor, considering the recounting of the tale a task of ‘unraveling certain human lots and seeing how they were woven and interwoven’) is the tension between reconciling the vows and demands of marriage and one’s personal vocation in life – a tension mostly conveyed by unfurling and paralleling the vicissitudes of two characters who precipitate themselves headlong into wedlock, a state on which they both harbour illusions which seem to echo each other and which will turn out at odds with their highly idealistic vocations and ambitions in life. We find the 19 year old Dorothea Brooke passionately wanting to devote herself to an scholarly clergyman, many years her senior, Edward Causabon, seeking wisdom and enlightenment herself - while the young doctor Tertius Lydgate dreams of a life of science, to be venerated and supported in this dream by the dedicated wife he sees in the mayor’s daughter, Rosamond Vincy (’his old dreamland, in which Rosamond Vincy appeared to be that perfect piece of womanhood who would reverence her husband’s mind after the fashion of an accomplished mermaid, using her comb and looking-glass and singing her song for the relaxation of his adored wisdom alone’).Both will bump into bitter reality (as in a sense for both marriage serves as a means to an end, the only possible outcome might have been disillusion on the nature of marriage). Dorothea finds her assistance unwelcome to her husband, while Tertius learns a ravishing appearance can hide a disgraceful (and to this reader appalling) selfishness. Their misfit marriages will eventually be counterpoised by a third, wonderfully balanced relationship, one of strong bonding based on ratio as well as emotions, a couple building a future on what could be seen as fundamental resemblances and complementary differences – complementarity far more subtle painted by Eliot than in a simple traditional division of the gender roles. Here is a relationship of mutual support and understanding for which both Dorothea and Tertius - good-natured, but dreamers - longed for in vain – however the initial pangs of disenchantment for both will have quite different consequences. Eliot’s presentation of what seems ideal marriage as a union of free-spirited individuals, united by true companionship as loving comrades, struck me as rather progressive or modern for her times (but I could be wrong in that assessment) as well as touchingly relatable. Reading Middlemarch to me not felt as escapism. As Julian Barnes wrote in his essay A Life with Books ‘Life and reading are not separate activities, When you read a great book, you don't escape from life, you plunge deeper into it. There may be a superficial escape – into different countries, mores, speech patterns – but what you are essentially doing is furthering your understanding of life's subtleties, paradoxes, joys, pains and truths. Reading and life are not separate but symbiotic’. His words ring quintessentially true with regard to Middlemarch – with its gorgeous, gossamer prose, the plethora of fascinating characters, the manifold references to art, the perceptive dictums wearing an aphoristic suit showing a tremendous insight into the human psyche, its subtly humorous asides, its wisdom and sympathy for humankind, this brilliant novel might simply be a reader’s dream, a way of experiencing the harmony of spheres. Following the thread to light and life Eliot is weaving, reminded me that life in all its depth at times can be pure bliss. "
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is the best book ever written, and why would you even think that? Who cares? It seems like a particularly male thing to do, this categorizing, this ranking. When George Eliot introduces Casaubon, a compulsive categorizer who has accomplished nothing of value, it feels like more than a character. It's a warning. She keeps quoting Eve from Paradise Lost, who was impressed by a man and look how that turned out. Eliot's talking about women following men and their dumb, arcane knowledge. Dorothea wants to be part of something grand, and the very idea is patriarchal. She ends up lost in a tomb. This is Casaubon, the archetypal mansplainer: so many facts, so little truth.So she leads with this grand male ambition, The Key To All Mythologies, but she's heading somewhere else. Here's the quote that she's spending 800 pages aiming for:The growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.And you're like oh, fuck yeah, right? Unhistoric acts are my whole jam! This is the truth: most of us will be regular. We can hope to find love, or at least acceptance. We hope that the cumulative effect of very many of us trying to do more or less the right thing will be that the world is more or less nice. A few of us will create great art, or live great lives. Very many of us will wish we had. George Eliot thinks we should settle down.People are surprised when they find out that I read mostly classics. ""What for?"" they ask. It sounds boring. ""What are you getting out of this?"" At its worst, it's some kind of Casaubonesque desire to know everything about something. Better, I hope there's some kind of cumulative effect of empathy and perspective. But best of all: this here, Middlemarch, is the only book I've ever read that changed the way I look at my entire life. It teaches me to settle down. I'm in the process of living faithfully a hidden life here. So perhaps are you. Coming to terms with that isn't just a lesson, it's the lesson, right? It's the whole game. It's either this or buy a convertible and re-pierce my ear. I read classics in hopes of finding something this good again.Okay so the whole game is in here, and the funny thing about this being the best book ever is that for the best book ever it is fucking boring. There's this whole part, like the middle third or so, that's frankly deadly. It happens about a hundred pages in; you've been having a grand old time with Dorothea and her shitty old husband who can't even fuck right, and all of a sudden Eliot starts introducing new people. It's not that they're not great - well, some of them aren't, I'm sorry but Mary and Fred are boring. But Rosamond! She's so awful! She's terrific and she very nearly runs off with the book. Casaubon is a bad man; Rosamond is a bad woman, and her damage to Lydgate is much worse.Rosamond is what Eliot started with, in fact; that was supposed to be the book. She was to be a response to the realist landmark Madame Bovary. Eliot decided she needed a counterweight in Dorothea, and then I don't know what all else happened. (That climactic confrontation between Dorothea and Rosamond, for one thing - what a scene, right? Eliot is one of the most compassionate writers, and here's where she puts her money down.) There's this complicated structure she builds - pretty Ladislaw, the banker Bulstrode, an old scandal, some surprisingly Victorian plot twists, given that Middlemarch is itself a realist landmark. Rather more talk about doctors than you needed. A lot of this stuff is boring.There's a famous quote from Virginia Woolf, who called Middlemarch ""one of the few English novels written for grown-up people."" She called it that despite ""all its imperfections,"" by the way, she thought it was boring too. But that's a grown-up message, that bit about the tombs. So here we are, right? Grown-ups, living faithfully our hidden lives, hoping to find peace with our unremarkableness. Here's the peace. You gotta make it through a boring part in the middle, but at the end you'll look back and find it was the best thing ever."
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,Rating 5 out of 5,"I put off reading this for actual decades : 900 crammed pages about the well-to-do folk of an ordinary small English country town called Middlemarch. I thought it might be tweedy. Jane Austen for those who wouldn't be caught dead reading P&P. . But also I suspected it would be a masterpiece. But a very verbose one. And yes, I was right. It is, and it is. And much of this tangled story is sad – there are two terrible marriages brilliantly described and there is a great scandal. But there’s an awful lot else. Lots. GEORGE ELIOT, CHURCHGOING ATHEIST, UNMARRIED COHABITOR, VICTORIAN BESTSELLERShe has a grand style but she’s also funny :He did not usually find it easy to give his reasons : it seemed to him strange that people should not know them without being told, since he only felt what was reasonableBrooke is a very good fellow, but pulpy; he will run into any mould, but he won’t keep shape.When you get me a good man made out of arguments, I will get you a good dinner with reading you the cookery-book.When a youthful nobleman steals jewellery we call the act kleptomania, speak of it with a philosophical smile, and never think of his being sent to the house of correction as if he were a ragged boy who had stolen turnips. And she’s able to throw out one-liners likeScepticism can never thoroughly be applied or else life would come to a standstillOh and she has a lovely vocabulary for those who enjoy dictionary diving – piluous, worreting, vinous and waternixie for instance.GEORGE IN PERSONOne thing that really aggravates me about every single critic who ever wrote about George Eliot is that they never fail to describe her as ugly, as in, REALLY ugly. Horsefaced. Henry James, who you might have thought was the Vesuvius of equivocation, said she was “magnificently ugly, deliciously hideous.” And came up with h the word “equine” which means “like a horse”. I don’t think anyone else gets this treatment. Look in the mirror, Henry. No oil painting yourself. THE INTRUSIVE NARRATORLike many Victorian authors, she comments on her own characters. Pardon these details for once – you would have learned to love them if you had known Caleb GarthShe calls another character “morally lovable”, and about somebody else she says “For my part I am very sorry for him”. And here she bursts into irritation with herselfOne morning, some weeks after her arrival at Lowick, Dorothea—but why always Dorothea? Was her point of view the only possible one with regard to this marriage?  PRE-FREUDIAN DELICIOUSNESSBut I think the heart and soul of Middlemarch is the intimate and entirely convincing psychological portraits of these characters – many of which you might have met before in other novels– and this just shows that in the hands of a great novelist fairly stock characters (the frustrated intellectual, the hot-headed idealist, the wily banker, the comical clergyman, the scurrilous blackmailer) and pretty familiar plots (will this one marry that one? Will that one get cheated out of their inheritance? Will this one’s shameful past be exposed?) everything comes back to tremendous life. George Eliot kisses the sleeping beauty of the Victorian novel and all those grey shades take on deep and subtle colours and all the people start moving again and nodding and smiling and weeping. Here she is on one young lady’s vision of marriage : In Rosamond’s romance it was not necessary to imagine much about the inward life of the hero, or of his serious business in the world: of course, he had a profession and was clever, as well as sufficiently handsome; but the piquant fact about Lydgate was his good birth, which distinguished him from all Middlemarch admirers, and presented marriage as a prospect of rising in rank and getting a little nearer to that celestial condition on earth in which she would have nothing to do with vulgar people And many pages later :The Lydgate with whom she had been in love had been a group of airy conditions for her, most of which had disappeared, while their place had been taken by every-day details which must be lived through slowly from hour to hour, not floated through with a rapid selection of favorable aspects. THE BEST PART OF MIDDLEMARCHYou can see she will suddenly move up a gear into a gear not known by average novelists when describing a character or situation, and a whole page becomes an effortless fusion of psychology and cosmology, she can dizzle your brain, make you high with her confident whole grasp of human intention and desire, I’d love to quote some of these passages but they are long. Here's a famous bit :If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel’s heart beat, and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence. As it is, the quickest of us walk about well wadded with stupidity. REALLY, DO I HAVE TO READ MIDDLEMARCH?No you don’t. I very nearly didn’t! Patience is required, especially between pages 200 and 400. I thought there weren’t enough of things actually happening. More people should have died or had bizarre farming accidents. My Penguin edition is 900 pages, I see some editions are 600-700, the print must be microscopic. So this is BIG. You have been warned. THE MORAL OF THE STORYIf you’re a lovely young woman don’t marry a guy 25 years older than you who seems to be an impressive intellectual but who only wants to make lists."

I again enjoyed George Eliot's Middlemarch, a pavement of nearly 1000 pages, a fantastic story of a small village in England where several locals' destinies meet, and we embark on a grand adventure from the very first pages!The novel focuses on several couples: Dorothea Brooke and M.Casaubon, a boring clergyman, followed by Dorothea and Will Ladislaw, whom we follow throughout history; the unhappy marriage of Tertius Lydgate, an ambitious but touching doctor, with Rosamond Vincy, a vulgar young woman wishing to arouse the admiration of all her neighbors; finally, the couple Fred Vincy / Mary Garth, whom I most appreciated.Besides, the characters are all more interesting than the others, offering a variety of roles among the individuals that the reader has the chance to meet. I preferred the style of Dorothea Brooke, endearing through his choices, the awkward moments of his life, his generosity to Doctor Lydgate, for example, and finally, access to happiness at the end of the novel. I also liked all the male characters, including M. Lydgate, Will Ladislaw, and Fred Vincy.Finally, George Eliot depicts the society of his time down to the smallest detail, allowing us to participate in animated discussions or participate in scandals upsetting the village and its surroundings.So I loved this excellent novel by George Eliot, one of the greatest of English literature, despite some flaws (though very rare)."

""Become who you are…” 
An epic tale that spotlights marriage, politics, religion, family, women, wealth, class, and reform, where choosing the right path is not just the poignant message but when tempered into words through deeply drawn characters, heavily weighted themes, and such elegant prose, this has become one of my favourite classic novels.Middlemarch is the most comprehensive, weighty, and expansive story for its range of themes and characters. However, the power of the story is the way in which it contrasts good versus evil, rich and poor, but most of all I loved the misguided illusions of self-importance that are pitted against the wisdom of the inquisitive, rational, and virtuous mind. So too is this a story where the morally virtuous are pitted against the moral delinquents in a rigid class system - an all too common ‘noble’ failure.In the end they all ‘become what they are’ !!!! But not all the impoverished are good and the scoundrels rich. George Eliot certainly mixes things up in this, the ultimate ‘Victorian’ character study.Absolutely brilliant.The Plot– This is such a multilayered story I’ve tried to capture the 3 main strands.Dorothea (Dodo), a wilful, intelligent, and independent 18-year-old girl marries, Edward Casaubon, an elderly nobleman, not for his wealth but for the opportunity it presents for her to expand her mind by helping the scholar in his work. Not long into the marriage, it becomes obvious he craves a companion, not a wife, and certainly not someone who would intrude on his intellectual work, often banishing her from his study.Although, the match is not encouraged by either Dodo or Will Ladislaw, (Casaubon’s cousin) after observing their interactions with each other, we as readers can only despair at the ‘perfect’ match that is never to be. Not just out of honour but when Casaubon dies, his ‘will’ states that his wife is to be denied his fortune should she marry Ladislaw. It seems he spotted what we did but not Dodo. Attempting Politics and other means of occupation, Ladislaw makes a few attempts at leaving Middlemarch and building his own fortune but to no avail. I love that these three characters personify the contrasts, in the story, the most particularly in virtue, commitment, reform, principles and kindness.The ambitious young doctor, Tertius Lydgate, is in a parallel but interconnected story, of love, reform, ambition, and the egotistical folly of keeping up appearances that drives him and his wife Rosamond, into debt. However, in this period of change, the most appealing part of their story is the resistance of the elite to maintain the status quo and frustrate progress and reform, while the industrious and ambitious people like the young Doctor are denied opportunity and wealth for daring to challenge. Even the right to vote.The third strand is that of Mary and Rosamond’s brother Fred, a scheming, gambling, and selfish young man who has long held expectations of an inheritance from his uncle, that never appears, forcing him to create wealth from other means, which in a nice way is the making of him.Review and CommentsOh why did it take me so long to read this?. Especially when I was gifted such a gorgeous Folio edition. It certainly wasn’t the 750 pages. No, I can tell you straight off it was the ‘uninspiring’ title of the book. It just didn’t draw me in.On reflection I am surprised that the word ‘vanity’ had not made its way into the title. Or indeed ‘reform’ that I noted was mentioned a lot throughout the story, in fact the title gives no indication of the drama, intrigue and superb storytelling that lies within the pages.Here’s what’s in store...Marriage and Love. It seemed at one stage Everyone was in love with the wrong person or someone out of reach. Yet there are three marriages (plus a lighter one). Apart from the obvious love interest between Dodo and Ladislaw, the one that I chuckled at was Mary, a working maiden, turning down the son of the wealthy aristocratic, Fred, until he proved himself worthy of her affections and hand in marriage!!!The Doctor and his wife, also added much to the marriage theme. Both were very flawed and cursed with vanity but also goodness. A couple who loved, miscommunicated, and forgave continuously as they matured individually and as a couple. As Eliot says of marriage “Some set out, like Crusaders of old, with a glorious equipment of hope and enthusiasm, and get broken by the way, wanting patience with each other and the world."" However, no such failure was the case with a number of our main characters, in others well it is true that some husbands for the sake of peace, learned the value of their ‘wives’ opinion. Characterisation - It was Dorathea and her story that kept me hooked. Typical of women in those days, she bore her displeasure and loneliness in silence. Yet such was her character that she made her presence felt without effort and never forcibly. Her subtleness, strength of mind, her intelligence and goodness puts her up there with Jane Eyre as one of the my all-time favourite female book heroines. “Certainly the determining acts of her life were not ideally beautiful. They were the mixed result of young and novel impulse struggling amidst the conditions of an imperfect social state, in which great feelings will often take the aspect of error, and great faith the aspect of illusion. For there is no creature whose inward being is so strong that it is not greatly determined by what lies outside it.""Although, I confess, I cannot imagine living in a time when women were to be seen and not heard. Branded for the apparent weak minds and sensitive nature. Only it was the men afraid of reform that portrayed them so.The range of characters like the themes is extensive. We have the Doctor, Politician, Judge, Landowers, the clergy, farmhand, judicial peace keepers, the scholars and scoundrels, painters, musicians, authors, and we even have the women who make a industry of ‘gossip’. And so, the characters traits are endless, but the main accomplishment in this novel unlike many other classic novels is the way in which Eliot portrays good and bad in all classes. Ambition and weakness to be found in all aspects of society as many are challenged in following the right path to ‘become who they are’!!!!Middlemarch is a book that is bold for the way it inspires feminism and reform. “A woman who did not want to live in a pretended admission of rules… women hemmed in by a social life which seemed nothing but a labyrinth of petty courses…. For the feeble minded” 'Middlemarch' is courageous in the way it challenges the accepted norms of society and religion but is also respectful. There is beauty in the storytelling, sincerity in the characters, and artistry in the way the themes have been woven into the story. An epic masterpiece in literature where selfishness is met with kindness, the elitist vanity is tempered by humble serenity from those around them, and where matters of the heart when followed with honesty, passion, and by all standards ‘proper’, make for the most satisfying ending, again not always typical of the authors during this period, as most people do “become what they are’!!!.A truly outstanding masterpiece.PS. The book has inspired me to pick up the BBC TV series. I am half way through and it is equally superb. Oh why did I wait !!!"

رمان «میدل مارچ» به‌ رغم سادگی ظاهریشان، زندگی درونی بغرنجی دارند؛ برخی بر معیارهایی پای می‌فشارند، تا همگان آن‌ها را تحسین ‌کنند، دیگرانی نیز بر روابط متکی هستند تا همگان آن‌ها را تشویق کنند؛ «میدل

فقیرانه، انگار جلوه ای افزونتر مییافت؛ دستانش و مچ دستهایش چنان خوش ترکیب بودند، که میتوانست آستینهایی بی پیرایه به دست کند، کم و بیش شبیه آستینهای مریم مقدس، به همان شکل، که نقاشان «ایتالیا» تصور میکردند، و نیمرخ و سکنات و حرکاتش نیز، گویی با جامه های ساده اش متانتی بیشتر مییافت، که در کنار جامه های رایج محل، به او جاذبه ای میبخشید شبیه جاذبه ی نقل قول درخشانی از «انجیل»، یا یکی از شاعران پیش کسوت ما، در میانه ی نوشتارهای روزنامه های روز؛ همه میگفتند بسیار با استعداد است، اما اضافه میکردند که خواهرش «سِلیا» عاقلتر است؛ با اینحال، «سِلیا» چندان آراسته تر از خواهرش؛ لباس نمیپوشید، و فقط ناظر دقیق، تشخیص میداد که لباسش، با خواهرش فرق دارد، و رگه ی ملایمی، از ناز و عشوه، در سر و وضعش هست؛ لباس پوشیدن ساده ی دوشیزه «بروک»، تابع اقتضائاتی بود، که عمدتا در مورد خواهرش نیز صدق میکرد؛ تشخص زنانه، یکی از آن اقتضائات بود، زیرا اصل و نسب خانوادگی «بروک» که البته اشرافی خالص نبود، مسلما « خوب » بود؛ اگر یکی دو نسل عقبتر میرفتید، هیچ جد و سلفی پیدا نمیکردید که کارش گز کردن، یا بسته بندی کردن بوده باشد؛ بله، پایینتر از دریاسالار، یا کشیش، در میان آنها پیدا نمیشد؛ حتی یکی از این اسلاف عالیجناب پیرایشگری بود، که در سپاه «کراموِل» خدمت میکرد، اما بعد کوتاه آمد، و توانست از مخمصه های سیاسی،

بیفزایند، تا منزلت خانوادگی را بیشتر حفظ کنند، اول از همه، از مخارج لباس میزدند؛ برای پوشیدن لباس ساده، چنین دلایلی کفایت میکرد، حتی اگر پای احساسات مذهبی به میان نمیآمد، اما در مورد دوشیزه «بروک»، احساسات مذهبی به تنهایی تعیین کننده بود؛ «سِلیا» هم تا حدودی با احساسات خواهرش موافقت نشان میداد، منتها به این احساسات، آن عقل سلیمی را میافزود، که با آن میشد تعلیمات پایه ای را، فارغ از هیجانهای عجیب

If I told you that my obsession with Middlemarch began with a standing KitchenAid mixer, you'd expect me to elaborate. It started one summer day when I was a teenager. My friend had invited me over to her house for a movie night and sleep over. Though our families had known each other since before either of our births, my friend and I had just recently reconnected with the help of a graduation party and AOL. The joys of dial up Internet. When I arrived, I was shown into the kitchen where my friend was in the midst of baking a batch of cookies with her mother. Her dad sat at the kitchen table reading an economics book, throwing in teasing remarks about our childhood antics while we all got reacquainted. It all seemed so...perfect. I was uncomfortably envious of my friend and her family. Two things in particular heightened this feeling. The gleaming navy blue standing KitchenAid mixer enshrined on the granite countertop. It was a recent gift to my friend, Gabby from her parents, since she was the glorified baker in the family. The other was an enormous, well-loved tome called Middlemarch, not far from the mixer, with a small scrap of paper protruding from the center of the spine, no doubt a thoughtless book marker.I had heard about this book from a few English teachers. It was said to be ""the quintessential British novel"" but that it was overly long, had too many characters, and was overall a political novel. This too was said of other books like Anna Karenina and War and Peace (not the English novel part, but the other stuff). It was such a discouragement! Comments like these made the books seem almost beyond my reach and comprehension. I asked about the book, wondering if Gabby was reading it for her advanced English class, and was relieved when her mom, Linda said that it was she that was reading it, and for the fifth time nonetheless. It was her favorite book, she said, and I learned that she was also a high school English teacher. When we started discussing it, and my love of Thomas Hardy, everyone else just disappeared. She took me into her study, and I had a look around her library. I was overwhelmed that Gabby could have parents that loved reading and encouraged their children to read too. Not only that, but they loved classic literature right along with Danielle Steel and James Michener. Looking back now, I realize it was probably the first bookish discussion that wasn't penned in an essay for my teachers' eyes alone or some other assignment. It was refreshing. From that day on, I vowed to myself that I too would one day own a standing Kitchen Aide mixer (because what kitchen is complete without one?), and I would undertake the reading of Middlemarch.It's essential that you know this back story because it would explain why I own three hardcopy editions, two kindle editions, and an audio edition of the book. It's almost as if I wanted to prevent any excuses I might have for putting it off, and I have for fifteen years. That I've finally read it feels like such a huge accomplishment!I can say with certainty that up to today, this is my favorite book. I adore Dorothea. She is such a unique character, often described as an odd type of woman; one that is both reverenced and respected as a man. I also admire Mary Garth and her father, Caleb, my two other favorite characters. The rest of the townsfolk that round out the novel create a tasty gumbo of gossip and family histories. While politics and reform had a bearing on many of the storylines, it wasn't difficult to understand with the help of a few online tools.On the whole and in my humble opinion, this is a novel of marriage–its disappointments, challenges, and triumphs. It's about the sacrifices people make and the mistakes they make in choosing suitable mates. Having made a poor decision in my previous marriage, so much about this book touched me deeply. Not that one has to be married, unhappily married or divorced to appreciate the book. So many of the genial characters were singletons, and served as a sort of control group, who although having their own share of difficulties, were still quite happy.
""Marriage, which has been bourne of so many narratives, is still a great beginning, as it was to Adam and Eve, who kept their honeymoon in Eden but had their first little one among the thorns and thistles of the wilderness. It is still the beginning of the home epic–the gradual conquest or irremediable loss of that complete union which makes the advancing years a climax and age the harvest of sweet memories in common.""
A friend's review urged that one should really take their time in reading this book, because once finished, the characters would be greatly missed. I've already felt a strong twinge of sadness at saying goodbye, even if only temporarily. Like Gabby's mom, Linda...I'm sure I'll revisit this book quite frequently. As for the KitchenAid mixer? I've never been able to excuse the purchase because I don't bake a lot...but it's still up there on my bucket list, along with ""Become a finalist on The Great British Baking Show."" "

On display was the original manuscript of Middlemarch!Middlemarch is a meandering novel, and it is slow. There are no explosions, dragons, or balls of fire. It doesn’t have the short, snappy dialogue like the Count of Monte Cristo. And it is time consuming to read.However, it has such beautifully developed, complex, nuanced characters—Eliot is the Queen of Imperfect Characters.Virginia Woolf said Middlemarch is “one of the few English novels written for grown-up people.” The characters are not cliches, and they live with the consequences of their actions. For example, one character was crying six weeks after marriage, complaining that she made a bad match. But who wouldn’t be crying after 6 weeks of international travel?These characters felt real, and I grew to love them.

Έχει αρχίσει ήδη η ανεπαίσθητη βαθμιαία αλλαγή του κοινωνικού τοπίου απο ραγδαίες επιστημονικές και τεχνολογικές ανακαλύψεις αλλά και παρακμάζουσες ανθρωπιστικές αξίες. Το Μίντλμαρτς όμως είναι πάνω απο όλα ένα έργο σιωπηλής,διαχρονικής,ιδιωτικής σύγκρουσης ανάμεσα σε δυο αντιμαχόμενα στρατόπεδα, τον άντρα και τη γυναίκα.

Η Έλιοτ ψυχογραφεί με γλυκιά ευαισθησία αλλά και καυστική ειρωνεία τους ήρωες της και ιδιαιτέρως τις γυναίκες στην αγγλική επαρχιακή κοινωνία της Βικτωριανής περιόδου. Σε μια εποχή που δεν επιτρεπόταν οι προσωπικές επιλογές των γυναικών αλλά σιγά σιγά η ανάγκη για ελευθερία ύψωνε μέσα τους το ανάστημα της. Η εξέγερση αυτή διαγράφεται -όπως αναφέρεται χαρακτηριστικά-ανθρωπιστικά στον ορίζοντα και σατανικά στο υποσυνείδητο. Η κεντρική ηρωίδα προσπαθεί να ξεφύγει απο το κατεστημένο και τις συμβάσεις της κοινωνίας,θέλει να ακολουθήσει την ατομική της βούληση, όμως είναι εφοδιασμένη μόνο με ρηχές γνώσεις λογοτεχνίας και ρομάντζα κοινωνικού λουστραρίσματος όπως απαιτούσε το πνεύμα της εποχής, με σκοπό η γυναίκα να διακοσμεί και να ψυχαγωγεί τον μελλοντικό σύζυγο. Η συγγραφέας τονίζει με μεγάλη ευστοχία και τραγική ειρωνεία στο προσκήνιο αυτού του κοινωνικού λαβύρινθου πως η αφύπνιση παντός είδους,η χειραφέτηση,η πραγματοποίηση ονείρων,επιθυμιών και ικανοτήτων,αρχίζει απο την παιδεία.

Εντέχνως κρύβονται οι βαθύτερες σκέψεις τους και τα αισθήματα τους μέσα σε αραχνοΰφαντες πολυπλοκότητες. Το Μίντλμαρτς είναι ένα είδος λαβυρινθώδους μαγικής εικόνας. Ένας ρεαλιστικά μοντέρνος μύθος που δύσκολα αναγνωρίζεται το πραγματικό και το αντίθετο του. Η παλινωδία μεταξύ φαινομένου και νοούμενου. Το τραγικό και το κωμικό. Το σοβαρό και το παράλογο. Το έγκλημα και η τιμωρία. Ο Αντρας και η Γυναίκα. Το μυστικό όλου του έργου κρύβεται στο μαγικό κλειδί που ανοίγει όλες τις Μυθολογίες ανά τους αιώνες. Το κλειδί είναι ο ρεαλισμός και η αφύπνιση συναισθημάτων,ικανοτήτων και σκέψεων με τη βοήθεια πάντα του Έρωτα. Αυτό το κλειδί του μυθοποιημένου φόβου απέναντι στις ""αυθεντίες"" και τις ανισότητες, ανοίγει την πόρτα του υποσυνείδητου και αντικρύζει το Μύθο νεκρό.

Middlemarch will haunt your every waking hour for the duration you spend within its fictional provincial boundaries. At extremely odd moments during a day you will be possessed by a fierce urge to open the book and dwell over pages you read last night in an effort to clarify newly arisen doubts - 'What did Will mean by that? What on earth is this much talked about Reform Bill? What will happen to poor Lydgate? Is Dorothea just symbolic or realistic?'And failure to act on your impulses will give rise to irritation. The world all around you will cease to matter and you will be forced to perform everyday tasks on autopilot mode, partly zombified, completely at the mercy of this wonderful, wonderful book. Even hours after you turn over the last page, Middlemarchers and their manifold conundrums and self-delusions will maintain their firm grasp on your consciousness. What I mean by these not at all far-fetched generalizations, is that Middlemarch is engaging, suspenseful and readable. Profoundly so. Despite its dense outlay of character arcs dovetailing into the politics of the community, subplots jostling against each other for primacy and the reader's attention, vivid commentary by an omniscient narrator who interjects often to shape a reader's perception, and the painstakingly detailed inner lives of its zealous hero and heroine struggling to hold on to their lofty ideals in the face of sobering reality and suffocating marriages, everything moves at a breakneck speed. I never knew when I ran out of pages to tear through. There are few happy coincidences here and certainly no deus ex machinas to bestow easy resolution on conflicts. Characters do not stumble upon gentrified fulfillment accidentally, those persecuted because of their 'lower birth' do not magically acquire status and wealth, thereby proving beyond doubt that Mary Ann Evans meant to contravene the most fundamental of tropes created by her more celebrated contemporaries. Instead they wrestle with their own conscience, hypocrisies, prejudices, mortal desires and fatalistic judgments. The day to day grind deepens their spiritual crisis, derails their noble mission of being a part, however insignificant, of the progress story of the world at large, makes them realize the futility of the individual's struggle against the forces that govern society. Some emerge victorious, able to cling to the passions and ardors that drive them ahead in life despite the inclemency of their circumstances. While others flail and flounder, succumbing to the tyranny of material wants and demanding, selfish spouses. If that's not bitter reality served up on a plate I don't know what is.If I am asked to pick one flaw with the plot and characters, I must confess I had considered withholding a star initially because of the book's treatment of Dorothea and the infuriating Ladislaw-Dorothea arc which made me want to quit reading out of pure frustration. Evans' fascination with subjecting every character's mental makeup to her trenchant irony seemed to expire every time her beloved heroine came into the picture. Frequent comparisons with the Virgin Mary and St Theresa and references to her queenly grace made me skeptical about her credibility as a character of flesh and blood in a narrative otherwise populated with believable, fallible men and women. Is she merely symbolic then of a life dominated by a 'soul hunger', completely immune to the mundane concerns of quotidian living? Why must her womanhood be almost deified and worshipped? But thankfully Dorothea is salvaged and humanized in the end, when she lets her own romantic passions overpower her altruistic zest. 
...the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.
Many may disapprove of the choice but if I had to name one book very similar to 'Middlemarch' in thematic content and in terms of a multiple-perspective narrative structure set against a modern backdrop, then Rowling's The Casual Vacancy comes to mind. In fact, it is hard not to figure out the connection after having read both books. If the slew of unfavorable reviews on GR and elsewhere nipped your interest in the bud, I urge you to give it a shot. Unworthy of literary immortality as it maybe, perhaps, it still offers an intricately detailed portrait of a small town and how individual choices shape the destiny of a society. Of course it is no Middlemarch as no book ever will be but it is where Rowling shows her true calibre as a novelist. And really, it is not as horrid as most reviewers made it out to be. Far from it."
15,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,Rating 4 out of 5,"Since it's still Stalker Week here on Goodreads, I decided to create a new shelf, which I've called older-men-younger-women. I hope that's neutral enough that I won't get flagged. My criterion is simple: a relationship between a man and a much younger woman needs to play an important part in the story.Well, as I was saying to Meredith, I knew ahead of time that Twilight and Lolita would be there. I trust we've already absorbed all the lessons that can usefully be drawn from these books, so I won't dwell on them. My list also contains a considerable number of volumes from the wonderfully trashy Brigade Mondaine series. If you look at these, you'll get rather more offbeat advice: for example, don't get involved with an older man if he's investigating your twin sister for a grisly murder, or don't get involved with an older man if he's just using you to help get his regular girlfriend back from a gang of Chinese criminals who are threatening her with death by poisonous sea-snake. (Note: it's okay if poisonous sea-snakes aren't involved).But it was the classic novels that surprised me most. I'd quite forgotten that some of them belonged to this category, and Middlemarch is the star example. Girls, don't get involved with elderly academics. They'll try and get you to do things you really don't want to do. Disgusting things. I'm having trouble even saying this, but they'll... they'll... they'll try to make you promise to edit their papers posthumously. They will. It's true. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shock you, but it was necessary. Just say no. And run."

As I spent a lot of 2008 and 2009 reading classics, I decided my time was now. This sprawling multi concurrent story arc-ed classic runs over four main plots following the lives and community of the fictitious Midlands town Middlemarch. Despite its length and age of publication this a surprising easy read although the ensemble cast and numerous story threads get a bit much at times. A tale of provincial life, the ingrained dis-empowerment of women and how marriage was just another tool to exact this. I have no doubt that this is a classic, and in its day a book that shook the world. I personally, didn't enjoy it that much, but on the other hand would never put anybody else off, of reading it. A strong Two Star, 5 out of 12. Plus it annoyed me that it took me so long to finish... churlish I know.2008 read"
17,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1642452-kenny,Rating 5 out of 5,"It is a narrow mind which cannot look at a subject from various points of view.Middlemarch ~~ George Eliot5/5Selected by Matthew for April 2021 Big Book ReadFrom time to time, I fall into a novel that invites me to completely rediscover the beauty of the English language. George Eliot’s Middlemarch is one of those rare works. This extraordinary story made me laugh, made me cry, and rekindled my belief that humanity’s creative abilities are worth all the pain and suffering that comes along with them.Yes, Middlemarch blew me away. This may well be my favorite Victorian novel.Middlemarch is awe-inspiring; it avoids the snares that would label it conceited and weighty. Its multitude of characters and overlapping plots allows Eliot to keep the pace of the book progressing quite quickly. The narrator seldom dwells on any one point too long unless it's thematically important, while quickly moving on from aspects of Middlemarch life that are immaterial to its characters’ stories. Eliot gives us an episodic glimpse at the lives of her characters, picking those instances which together form an irresistible novel.Eliot masterfully balances several related but distinct plots that take place in the fictitious town of Middlemarch. Although the story takes place during the Great Reform Bill of 1832, politics, thankfully, play a minor role. The story is largely character-driven and focuses on rural English life, which sounds boring until you realize that it's utterly fascinating. Imagine a highbrow Peyton Place circa 1832.Eliot and Middlemarch owe its success to its characters. Every single character is three-dimensional, with virtues and vices, hopes and dreams, gains and setbacks. Even characters who start out as seemingly two-dimensional foils or antagonists, like Rosamond Vincy and Mister Bulstrode, turn into flesh and blood characters for whom the reader feels a mixture of sympathy, pity, and disgust. Eliot doesn't write down to her readers; her characters do both noble and ignoble deeds.Almost all of the conflict in Middlemarch stems from gaffes by the characters themselves, along with a little external conflict added by wanderers like Raffles and Ladislaw. Eliot loves to pit two very likable characters against each other. Take, for instance, Mister Farebrother and Fred Vincy, who both love Mary Garth. Mister Farebrother’s an honest vicar who's so well-meaning that he in fact sabotages his chances with Mary by acting as Fred's emissary. Fred, while somewhat idle and lacking focus, also means well and eventually determines to get his life together and do whatever he must to earn Mary's hand. As a result, Eliot creates quandaries to which there's no happy answer ~~ a blunt equivalent to real life.Time and again, characters entertain delusions about the world around them that prove false and even often harmful. Fred Vincy ~~ his entire family, in fact ~~ rely on the fact that he will inherit property from the ailing Peter Featherstone; he's left with nothing when Featherstone wills his estate to an illegitimate son from out of town. Dorothea marries the unpleasant Mister Casaubon because she believes it's her purpose in life to help him in his religious scholarship; instead, she ends up an unhappy widow who remarries a erratic man. Rosamond Vincy falls head-over-heels for up-and-coming Doctor Lydgate only to discover that he’s far more in love with treating patients than attending parties. Lydgate experiences a similar dissatisfaction with his spendthrift new bride. In case you haven't noticed, a good deal of the unhappiness in Middlemarch stems ~~ as it does in most Victorian novels ~~ from marital conflict.Eliot's observations about marriage ~~ in fact, about life in general ~~ are precise and clever. She's like a funnier, more cutting, more caustic Jane Austen ~~ yes, I know Austen is funny, cutting and caustic ~~ it’s just that Eliot is more so. In Middlemarch, on the other hand, the marital strife is real ~~ this strife is reflected in the reactions of the townspeople. Eliot's social commentary is much stronger than Austen's because Eliot has constructed an entire microcosm in the form of Middlemarch society ~~ a variety of views are championed by its characters who expose you to perspectives you may otherwise never conceive of. Ultimately, that is what makes this story ~~ all stories ~~ successful. In an era where technology makes it increasingly easier to control the perspectives to which one's exposed, Middlemarch is all the more relevant.Middlemarch is intricately complex. I stumbled thru the first 150 pages, but once I changed my approach to it ~~ thank you, Matthew ~~ I fell in love with the characters, the village of Middlemarch and the universe Eliot created. I will have a hard time leaving this world behind.Middlemarch is an incontestably brilliant achievement ~~ a compassionate portrait of the inescapable fragility of human nature, as well as a testament to our capacities for kindness, courage, and right action. Middlemarch is rightfully referred to as the greatest English novel of all time, and is a tremendous accomplishment. Middlemarch can proudly be placed alongside Eliot’s Russian contemporaries as a towering achievement of literature. "
18,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32532774-lisa,Rating 5 out of 5,"I am leaving Middlemarch!  I can't believe it, after spending so much time with them, I am now done, moving on, moving out, like Lydgate and Bulstrode and Ladislaw and Dorothea. Middlemarch is a state of mind, and you can drop it or it can drop you. In my case, I feel it dropped me, for I would have clung on to it even after turning that 918th page that was the final one! Does that make me more of a Bulstrode then, rather than a Dorothea? Well, obviously I am quite like the Middlemarch men in general, feeling there can't be anyone comparable to the wonderfully stubborn and idealistic Dorothea!The gossipers got it all right, of course. Dorothea was not a ""nice woman"", marrying an illusion first and a passion next. A ""nice woman"" would have married greed first and ambition next, and she would have been the most respected woman in town, if she kept reasonably stupid and pretty.I always feel a bit sorry for my immediate environment when I read one of the ""big novels"" for the first time, for just like Dorothea, I find it hard to play the nice and pretty and detached part that decorum expects of a lady reader. I live and breathe the book, and I get angry and frustrated and annoyed with the course the story takes. I have spent evenings muttering about Bulstrode, and mornings yelling at Rosamond, the female nightmare that the 19th century prided itself in creating as an expensive form of decorative art for conventional society (- all art is quite useless, said a wild and wise man!). I have worried with Fred and scolded with Mary, and felt for Farebrother, and told Lydgate to dump his wife and run.I have meddled with Mrs Cadwallader, telling her that HER meddling is going in the wrong direction, and that she is setting up people for unhappiness and failure. And I have wondered at the genius of George Eliot, who must have been the most intelligent and perceptive person within the country she called home. And I have wondered how lonely she must have felt as a result of that great mind she carried around in that deeply misogynistic and conventional society.How must the Rosamunds of her environment have suffocated her! How must the very concept of matrimony and conventionality have struck her as a road to hell? In Dorothea's brave words, her insight shines through:""Marriage is so unlike everything else. There is something even awful in the nearness it brings.""And as the novel comes to a close, one wonders a bit if Dorothea ever felt a pang of regret that she married twice, nice or not nice as her matches may be called. One wonders if that second marriage wasn't the greatest sacrifice of all, and not because of the lost fortune, but because of the destructive principle she recognised herself. Bound to a man by the disapproval of society, would the passion stay, or would conventional awfulness take its place? Who knows? George Eliot herself only knows why she made Dorothea respectable rather than a free spirit in the end. For after all, the whole novel is about suppressed sex. An affair (or two) would have cured that nicely...Best of the best, and that's my blooming rage speaking in rankings!"
19,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5498525-fionnuala,No Rating,"During the last couple of months I've met the entire cast of characters George Eliot created for her novels. They are a varied bunch but the one thing they have in common is that they are very memorable. I just have to close my eyes to picture each of them, or better still, hear them speak — the tenor of the voice Eliot gives each character goes a long way towards lodging them firmly in the mind. Which makes it very odd that the character I find the most memorable is the one who speaks the least. But he does manage to express himself well in spite of his lack of volubility, and it is Eliot's description of these non-verbal communications that makes him live in the mind long after the story in which he finds himself has ended. Caleb Garth is not one of the main characters in Middlemarch but he is nevertheless a central character, linking the other characters together. By making him a surveyor, a builder and a farm manager, Eliot can move him easily from one part of Middlemarch to another which allows him to play a pivotal role in all the principal plot threads. His quiet wisdom is like a backdrop to the entire narrative. His wisdom reveals itself in the way he thinks carefully before speaking, and in his reluctance to repeat gossip or comment on other people's behaviour in a community in which gossip is everyday currency. He is an unusual character but not an unlikely one, I think. Indeed, I had the distinct impression that Eliot must have known someone like Caleb, that she had observed that person closely and perfectly understood his heart and mind. The impression is strengthened by the minuteness of her descriptions: the way he raises his spectacles to listen, or pushes his chair back to consider what he's just heard, or fits his fingertips together with much nicety. The way he moves his hat about the table, sticks his fingers between the buttons of his waistcoat, or stares meditatively at the ground to avoid an awkward question. It always seemed to him that words were the hardest part of “business.”Eliot catches his every facial expression, particularly the angle of his eyebrows as he peers over his spectacles. And she pays special attention to his hands:He looked at the ground, leaning forward and letting his long fingers droop between his legs, while each finger moved in succession, as if it were sharing some thought which filled his large quiet brow.Because Caleb has many thoughts, and even if the thing he most fears is having to speechify, when he does work himself up to deliver his thoughts, his eyes sparkle and his words come effortlessly. At such a moment he might pause to take a pinch of snuff but he will be so intent on delivering his thought that the snuff will remain between his fingers as if it were a part of his exposition. He was fond of a pinch when it occurred to him, but he usually forgot that this indulgence was at his command.At other times, the words simply won't come, and under pressure, he resorts to biblical phrases: It was one of Caleb’s quaintnesses, that in his difficulty of finding speech for his thought, he caught, as it were, snatches of diction which he associated with various points of view or states of mind; and whenever he had a feeling of awe, he was haunted by a sense of Biblical phraseology, though he could hardly have given a strict quotation.But in spite of quoting the Bible from time to time, he isn't a rigid or judgmental person: If he had to blame any one, it was necessary for him to move all the papers within his reach, or describe various diagrams with his stick, or make calculations with the odd money in his pocket, before he could begin; and he would rather do other men’s work than find fault with their doing.How can the reader not love such a character. And if all that wasn't enough, consider this paragraph:Caleb was very fond of music, and when he could afford it went to hear an oratorio that came within his reach, returning from it with a profound reverence for this mighty structure of tones, which made him sit meditatively, looking on the floor and throwing much unutterable language into his outstretched hands.I rest my case."
20,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48056505-piyangie,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is such a beautiful book and the first George Eliot work that I enjoyed. I've read her before, and although I appreciated their merit, I cannot say that I enjoyed them. In  Middlemarch, I found a work of Eliot that I truly enjoyed.The original title of this work is Middlemarch: A Study of Provincial Life. True to the title, the work portrays the lives of people in a provincial town. Their conventions, their social, political, and religious ideologies, their values, their social status, their pride, their vanities, their jealousies, their suspicions, the way of living, the inter-human relationships, all are discussed at length in the work. The author's observing nature is well displayed throughout the book whereby the ideas, values, and human nature are truthfully and genuinely portrayed. Although many areas are discussed through this lengthy work, it can be narrowed down thematically to three distinct categories: social status, conventions, and relationships. These three themes are interwoven and are brought to light through the numerous characters employed in the story. Victorian Era is well known for its conventional rigidity and the judgmental and opinionated society. Eliot brings them to light brilliantly, all the time subtly satirizing them. There are three love stories here. The first and foremost is the one between the female protagonist, Dorothea, and Will Ladislaw. When young Dorothea's elderly husband dies being suspicious of hers and Will's friendship, he puts a codicil in his will preventing a future union between them. Will is of a questionable parentage although being related to Dorothea's husband. This codicil and the conventional view of her friends that she will fall from social rank by marrying a man beneath him work as a yoke on Dorothea. But her willful, strong and just nature defies convention, dares poverty, and follows her heart. The steady and strong attachment between Fred and Mary despite the difference in their social status (according to Fred's family) is another. The educated yet unstable Fred has no proper vocation, nor has he any wealth. But despite all obstacles, they remain faithful to each other, Mary and her father, slowly helping him to stand on his own feet - Mary through encouraging and Mr. Garth through aiding. The more rigid and artificial relationship is the one between pretty Rosamond and Dr. Lydgate. Both being entered into matrimony through a mistaken conception of each other, they find the marital bond to be rather too heavy. These three love stories were quite interesting. And I was quite surprised at the author's willingness to create happy ending love stories, for I have always associated her with tragedies. The characters, be it main or supporting, were an interesting lot. Eliot has chosen them with care. I couldn't find a male protagonist, but the female protagonist, Dorothea grew on me. She was introduced as an ignorant, naive, and high-minded young girl for whom I didn't care much. Her character is developed through her trials and she becomes a strong, willful yet kind, sympathetic as well as an empathetic young woman. Eliot tends to create strong female characters and it is quite appealing. This story has two strong women. One is the above mentioned Dorothea. The second is Mary Garth who with her influence and love helps Fred become stable in life. Despite her love to have strong female characters, she uses a good number of strong male characters as well here. And through the balance Eliot has been able to portray the true conditions and relations between the two opposing sex during the Victorian time. Eliot's writing is bold and commanding. She doesn't concentrate on poetic beauty but is concerned more in the power with which she tells her story. I have always liked her tone of voice. The story is a mixture of Austenian social criticism and Dostoevskian human psychology and her bold and graceful writing blended well with the story. Middlemarch really is one beautiful work I read in a while. It is quite a complete work which gives immense enjoyment and satisfaction for those who read it. I never thought that I'll be ever able to enthusiastically praise George Eliot, and I'm happy to have been able to do so. Now I can say with my whole heart that she is a great author."

Review soon … going to rest first.Update — review below (ha, not an easy book to review), but I gave it 5 stars for the magnificent magnitude masterpiece that this book is — ( hard to deny it). Sure, I struggled- but I also enjoyed plenty! Ebook — synced with audiobook…. The audio was narrated by Maureen O’Brien (an English actress and author)….. I thought Maureen was terrific. I’ve had no active life recently….(not a happy camper about it)…but I’ve an abundant amount of time to lie around and read. (but it gets tiring sometimes too - so I’ve done a lot of just lying around — [my life is on ‘pause’ these days]….waiting for for brilliant medical answers. And…….You know what I might remember most about this book years from now? My own physical limitations, radiating pain from my spine, and waiting for a diagnosis and a medical miracle quick cure. Ha!…. ….along with the knowledge that most of the time when I read …. it’s a comforting experience, reduces stress and depression, and then if the book is really good — I get excited to chat about it with a friend. ‘Book-phone-chat’ is sooo much more satisfying than ‘sex-phone-chat’.I started out reading the ebook format — I soon discovered the audiobook was a freebie with my Audible membership. Adding Maureen O’Brien’s unique voice — while also reading along with the ebook allowed for deeper concentration, plus I enjoyed the way Maureen delivered the voices of the different characters personalities. Maureen’s artistry was like a full bright-colorful rainbow ….her changes of intonation, inflection, accents, transitions, and variations….were superb. She added charm! And…. By reading along with Maureen —it was easy to stop the audiobook at any time and highlight passages.  ….. the audio itself is 32 hours and 23 minutes.So…..what to share about this book….…..Dorothea Brooke was forthright — often blunt. Smart & savvybut ‘not’ so smart that she married Edward Casaubon, who was twice her age, an unbetting match. I understood Dorothea’s reasoning to marry Casaubon….(an intelligent scholar she felt she could learn from) —but many hidden ‘marriage-match’ flaws continued to unravel. Dorothea was only nineteen at the start. She was an orphan — and had great dreams of doing something meaningful in the world. (we have a clue her dreams won’t be a straight line to proud success). …..Mr. Casaubon was 45 years old, wealthy, high ranking in society—a church going man, socially awkward….and a rather dull husband. He was also controlling, jealous, and basically an all around no-fun husband. …..Tertius Lydgate was the younger stud-doctor. He had medical practice outside of Middlemarch…..and was considered an idealist for wanting to reform medicine. He married Rosamond Vincy. (the shallow beauty every man wish to fuck— oops— marry). Problems - problems - problems continue….( gotta have more then just fantasy love and good looks)….There are tons of characters:…..Celia Brooke was Dorothea‘s younger sister who married Sir James. ….Mary Garth — a loyal woman….writes children’s books. She marries a man named Fred Featherstone, and they have three children..…..there is the town banker, a Polish musician, a grandmother, an owner of a huge estate, a frog face man, etc.There are secrets, feminist themes, sickness, (thyroid fever), wisdom and moral inquiry…. “Life must be taken up on a lower stage of expectation, as it is by men who have lost their limbs”.I’m not sure why this is considered the greatest British novel ever….(I’m an American)….but it’s considered a masterpiece.So, sure, I’ll bite: This book is a work of extraordinary skill. It was not an easy-breezy read — but for my first read I did alright …. I have and had my own flaws as a reader, of Middlemarch ….as much as the characters had flaws….. (But I had compassion for the characters—and compassion for myself)….thankful to Michelle for encouraging me to stay with it. I ‘can’ promise you a rose garden but I can’t promise I’ll read this again. But ….it was an overall valuable experience ….and I’m happy to also be done. Women, marriages, unfulfilling marriages, deaths, more marriages, religion, philosophy, music, political reform, education, heroines and villains, scandals, struggles and weaknesses, criticized and pitied characters, success and failures, identity, community conformity, men taken care of by good wives, complexity,and disturbances of ‘calm’. Perhaps today in 2022, this book could be called “The Problems With Love”…..I’ll end with a small quote that speaks to me…..(wisdom I try to practice myself) “It is a narrow mind which cannot look at a subject from various points of view”. Blessings to my friends…..I soooooo cherish our connectionsP.S.  …..this will be my favorite in the world if I soon become pain free….getting medical help that will help….so I can be a happy spunky - moveable woman again."

""but what we call our despair is often only the painful eagerness of unfed hope.""

middlemarch is a behemoth book at almost 1000 pages. but it’s a book that grows with you.i see a lot of people love and rave about jane austen and the bronte sisters (as do i), but i seldom see anyone talk about the masterpiece that is george eliot’s middlemarch.middlemarch is one of those books that you just know you’ll be going back to time and again, the ones you want to fill the margins with annotations. the ones you want to write over your old ones with new ones because you know your perspective will change over time as the words grow up with you.there is no big plot in this book - it is simply a portrayal of provincial life in the victorian age. the magic, ironically, lies in its mundanity and dullness. the characters are so real and so human, and we as readers grow with them over the course of nine hundred something pages. it is a masterclass in empathetic and sympathetic portrayal of characters. while it does not have a dramatic flair like austen’s novels, middlemarch’s beauty lies in its subleties and mundanities of ordinary life.when i was done with middlemarch, it filled me with an odd feeling of melancholy. like it had made me hopeless and hopeful at the same time. such is the nature of human emotions, but this is what makes the novel so timeless. we get access to the characters’ introspection but we also view them from other character’s perspectives. this sort of intimate connection with the characters allows us to care deeply for them by the end.eliot shows the scene of victorian england through the people of this small town. it paints such a beautiful parallel that this fictional book can almost serve as a historical marker for this era.middlemarch is filled with questions of what it is to love and what it is to live with and for someone else. it’s packed with political criticism, ordinary financial struggles, romantic lines that made my heart hurt, sarcastic humor, and a strong authorial voice.in thirty years, i hope to see the same copy of middlemarch on my shelf - a bit frazzled, flowing to the brim with annotations, and with a record of my life the same way eliot recorded the lives of these characters.———————————ok i completely fell off the radar for the daily updates because i was stupidly busy this month (i'm so so sorry emma i hope you still love me) BUT i am done!!and holy shit holy shit holy shit what a MASTERPIECE. i am literally underqualified to write a review for this. but alas, review to come in a few days.for everyone scared of reading this because of the length: don't let the length deter you!! deciding to read this was the best decision i made this month.———————————the start of a month long experiment where emma and i peer pressure each other into reading three chapters a day and see how far we get.day 1 [chapters 1-3]: three chapters in. so far, i'm pleasantly surprised. the description & narrative aren't redundant and the readability is not as hard as i thought it would be. stay tuned to see if this remains true.day 2 [chapters 4-6]: i kind of wish i had read this book in college because of how much i want to analyze and discuss every little element. i love how different dorothea and celia are and how well politics/commentary about gender roles are woven in. can't believe i like this so much?day 3 [chapters 7-9]: weirdly this feels more modern than jane austen books. like, all the very intense descriptions + 'classic' elements are there, but it reads so nicely. also. the way age + gender & its intersections are explored? love it.day 4 [chapters 10-12]: celia vs dorothea and will vs casauborn is super interesting? also. rosamond !!!day 5 [chapters 13-15]: lydgate is so idealistic it hurts but also...i'm tired of him. also, literally fuck featherstone. also lydgate wanting a ""strictly scientific view of women"" lmaoday 6 [chapters 16-18]: i love the weird political microcosm in Middlemarch and the pro/anti reform. also also also rosamund: ""it was part of Rosamond's cleverness to discern very subtly the faintest aroma of rank.""——————————emma and i decided to read this in march because reading middlemarch in march is poetic and nice.what's not nice is the fact that this book is 918 pages."
24,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4639825-j-o,Rating 3 out of 5,"Read as part of The Infinite Variety Reading Challenge, based on the BBC's Big Read Poll of 2003.Once in a while a book comes along that I can't quite rate. Not because it's brilliant, or terrible, but because it has too many elements within it that make me feel different things-often polar opposites. This is one such book.When I first started reading it I was in a mental slump, which meant I was also in a reading slump. It is lengthy-at nigh on 900 pages-which contributed to the fact that I didn't much want to read it. And, I must say, it is too long. There are some books that need to be that long but they are few and far between: this was written in a double-Dickensian manner. That made it pretty tough going.The characters were not of any interest to me singularly. I felt no sympathy for any of them, nor any empathy, and I didn't much care what happened to them as individuals. That's quite rare in books, but in this case it mattered less than it should have because collectively as Middlemarchers they were sublime creatures. Their intricacies and the way they were threaded together-relying on one another for everything-was spectacularly written. I felt the warm-heartedness and cold-aloofness of the community within my very being.Middlemarch itself as a place is so very intriguing. It was lacking certain elements of world-building in the guise of description, but if you can imagine the English countryside with rolling hills and brick farms and many a cow then you're half-way there. Middlemarch still exists almost today and I almost live there, which adds to the romance of the whole thing. The location of this book is one of the best things about it and, I suppose, the slow nature of the book reflects the slow nature of countryside life.The era is blameless, too. Regency England right through to the end of the First World War is the golden period of English when it comes to book eras. It is a magical period to look back on and the books actually written in those times are almost faultless when considering their era and setting alone. I had a hard time reading through this book but there were still so many little things to be enjoyed. It is quite the behemoth (and was recently voted as the number one best British book by non-British critics) and it can be daunting and perhaps a little tedious, but the way it draws you in a slows down time, lulling you in to a requiem of almost infinite repose is quite something."

The Author is not Marching hidden in the Middle.
One could write a very long review just collating the various responses to this novel by subsequent writers. In my edition the introduction was written by A.S. Byatt who quotes James Joyce and John Bayley. I have also encountered somewhere that Julian Barnes thinks this is the best novel written in English.I will not attempt that collage, but I wish to begin with two other quotes.In a letter to his friend and painter Anthon van Rappard, from March 1884 (that is, just four years after George Eliot’s death), Van Gogh wrote: 
While Eliot is masterly in her execution, above and beyond that she also has a genius all of her own, about which I would say, perhaps one improves through reading these books, or perhaps these books have the power to make one sit up and take notice.
And the second may seem at first from an unrelated book and matter. My suspicion, though, is that Mary Ann Evans would have been pleased for the connection between Carl Sagan’s Cosmos and her novel.
A book is made from a tree. It is an assemblage of flat, flexible parts (still called ‘leaves’) imprinted with dark pigmented squiggles. One glance at it and you hear the voice of another person—perhaps someone dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, the author is speaking, clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you.  (bold letters are mine)So we have one genius recognizing another and showing awareness of the artifice in which an artist engages (‘masterly in her execution’). And we have another genius drawing attention to the time-travel-artifacts that are books, because they allow us to be in direct contact with an Author from a previous age.Author?Yes, Author. And well alive thanks to the books authored. In spite of what Modernist artists and writers have been playing with, and what Roland Barthes defended in his Death of an Author, I felt the Author was very near and clear in the Foreground of this novel.Had I read this book years ago, I may have been irritated by the overt presence of the Narrator. All those morals comments and those directions to the reader would have seemed to me to interfere and hinder the advancement of the action, or obstructed my own independent view. Not in the least. Instead I found myself perking up and underlying whenever I heard or read the Narrator’s clear voice. Sitting up and taking notice, as Van Gogh had written. The utterances came in different tones and flavours. Sometimes warning or guiding the reader:
The faults will not, I hope, be a reason for the withdrawal of your interest in him.""
Or:
must not we, being impartial, feel with him a little?
Or providing us with a little moral aedification:
We are most of us brought up in the notion that the highest motive for not doing a wrong is something irrespective of the beings who would suffer the wrong.""
But fascinating were those of the Narrator’s claim to be acting as a natural historian:
But Fielding lived when the days were longer (for time, like money is measured by our needs).... We belated historians must not linger after his example.""
Or even more astounding, to those which betray the notion that the Narrator is artificer:
And here I am naturally led to reflect on the means of elevating a low subject.
Which means that the Narrator is aware of the rivalry between a painter and a writer. Which of those two arts is more persuasive?
…painting and Plastik are poor stuff after all. They perturb and dull conceptions instead of raising them. Language is a finer medium....Language gives a fuller image, which is all the better for being vague.. The true seeing is within; and painting stares at you with an insistent imperfection... as if a woman were a mere colored superficies..""
And yet, even if this Narrator is also part of the fictional structure of the work, and serves as a mechanism for the reader to enter without participating on the world narrated, and is not the Author, nonetheless I cannot fail to hear that this voice has a very particular tone and timbre. And it was this awareness that kept me so excited during my read.For me this voice has a name: Mary Ann Evans. And I have heard her inside my head, as Sagan says."
26,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3145526-traveller,Rating 4 out of 5,"Since I've been told bigger is better, and long reviews are better than short ones, I've decided to update my short Middlemarch review with a long one:Although Eliot started working on the serialised chapters of Middlemarch around about 1868 (they were published three years later), it is set in roughly 1829-1832, (so writing it took place roughly 40 years after the setting) which gave her the advantage of hindsight.It is partly this, and the fact that Eliot did a lot of conscientious research, that enabled her to render the period with such historical accuracy. Aristophanes, Plato, and Goethe, Feuerbach, Spinoza, and Auguste Comte all had an influence on Eliot's thought; -though she seems to illustrate in Middlemarch a kind of social determinism. It seems to me that she is saying that your class will to a large extent determine how you live (which was largely true still in the era that the novel is set in). Individual character and 'moral fiber' is important to Eliot, but in her novel personal ideals easily become shipwrecked on the rocks of what the forces of society has pre-ordained for you. 19th Century determinism was to a large extent due to Darwinism: The question to be considered in this regard is, do people lack all free will - are their actions predetermined by their genetic make-up, and/or their psychological background, or do people have a real opportunity to make an impact on the world, and to be responsible for their actions? Eliot seems to lean towards the idea that good intentions don't necessarily spell success, and not only character plays a role: choices and environment do too. However, the choices of Eliot's characters are subjugated by the forces of society. The characters play out what seems to be pre-set ""roles"" for them; no matter how they struggle, like flies in a web, they eventually have to conform to the role society has laid out for them. The portrayal of marriages play a large role in Middlemarch, in illustrating various things.In the marriages that Eliot portrays, we see mainly personal character coming into play with the strictures of society, and the ways in which the latter confines these people decides on the final happiness or not of the characters. The good outcome of the marriages don't depend on divine providence anymore, as it tended to in novels written before the realist/humanist/rationalist style that Eliot to a large extent pioneered, came into being; it is now the forces and expectations of society.Material wealth and affluence play a large part, too, in how the characters manage to handle the forces society exerts upon the individual: at least four of the marriages are ""made or broken"" in part by how the protagonists manage to attain their wealth, but there is a very complex interplay regarding how the characters manage or attain their wealth.An important early influence in Eliot's life was religion. She was brought up within a Low Church Anglican family, but she soon rejected religion in favor of the aforementioned schools of thought. The importance of morals and 'duty' still remained deeply ingrained in her belief system, though.The possession of knowledge, and the use of that knowledge is highly praised by Elliot. She makes a distinction between the dead and irrelevant knowledge that her character Casaubon displays, and the living and useful knowledge that her characters Lydgate, Farebrother and Mrs Garth possess. The 19th century saw a great move towards more ""practical"" thought. Scientific thought was starting to revolutionize every sphere of human life.It is probably of use to take cognizance of the industrial sociopolitical background to the period that the novel covers: The 19th century was the age of machine tools - tools that made tools - machines that made parts for other machines, including interchangeable parts. The assembly line was invented during the 19th century, speeding up the factory production of consumer goods. There was a lot of resistance towards automation from the lower classes, since many people were displaced from their work by machines, especially in the textile industry. In rural areas the remains of the feudal system could still be seen in that land tenants gave labour for the right of tenancy, but didn't receive much as payment, and often lived in very poor conditions. The industrial revolution saw a sharp rise in population, and resulting increase in a poverty-stricken lower class. There were groups agitating for reform, but most of them confined themselves to lawful, non-violent means of supporting reform, such as petitioning and public oratory, and they achieved a great level of public support.  The many social injustices such as young children working exceedingly long hours in mines and factories, and being made to do very dangerous work; industrialists preferring to employ women and children because they could get away with paying them less, etc, as well as the aftermath and influences of the French Revolution and humanism on general thought, was stirring winds and thoughts of political revolution throughout English society. The upper classes, as quite humoristically portrayed by Mr Brooke in Middlemarch, would, according to Eliot's portrayal, albeit reluctantly, prefer to ""go with the times"" than to be ""caught up in, or going against an avalanche"" ..and lose their heads as had so many of the French aristocracy. The period also saw the rise of wealthy capitalists - all of these are represented in the novel, there is a family from each walk of life represented in Eliot's cast of characters.Middlemarch also illuminates many aspects of scientific thought at the time. The novel exhibits an extraordinary interest in medical politics, especially. General influences here, were Bichat, Lyley, Claude Bernard, Auguste Comte T.H. Huxley, John Stuart Mill, William Whewell, Herbert Spencer,and G.H. Lewes, Eliot's companion.The 19th century gave birth to the professional scientist; interesting to note, is that the word 'scientist' was first used in 1833 by William Whewell. In Middlemarch, Eliot pays a lot of attention to what is happening to the medical profession at the time. According to her various biographies, she did quite a bit of research into what was happening on the front of medical science.For instance, one of the historically true incidents reflected in Middlemarch, is that in 1932 a worldwide Cholera pandemic reached Britain. Lydgate, one of the protagonists of the novel, is involved in and very much interested in studying and treating fevers, such as Typhoid and Cholera. A note of interest: In 1819 René Laënnec invented the stethoscope, one of the instruments mentioned in the novel; - at that point in time, this was something quite cutting edge and new .Before the advent of the 18th century, the medical profession had not progressed much since classical times. In fact, people were probably even worse off in places like Christian hospitals, where the main cure given to patients was prayer. There had been, throughout the Middle Ages, a belief that the human body should remain intact after death, since it would rise up to heaven in a glorified state. In Middlemarch, we see this sentiment to some extent still prevalent, something which Eliot seems to deplore.Incidentally, it was a common theme in Victorian literature to paint doctors and students of science who wanted to dissect human bodies as ""evil"". Of course, one needs to dissect the human body before you can research what it looks like inside, and how it works, so of course beliefs like these held back the progression of medical science.In the novel, Eliot also focuses on the aspect of gender inequality that existed at the time. Women didn't receive the same education as men, and especially upper class and aristocratic ladies were expected to be merely ornamental;  this is highlighted in especially the marriages of Dorothea with first Casaubon and later Will, as well as the marriage of Rosamond with Lydgate.Time and time again, Eliot illustrates the frustration that an intelligent woman had to endure in Victorian England: ""...there was the stifling oppression of that gentlewoman's world, where everything was done for her and none asked for her aid – where the sense of connection with a manifold pregnant existence had to be kept up painfully as an inward vision, instead of coming from without in claims that would have shaped her energies. ""I noted Eliot's strong interest in Saint Theresa of Avila, whom she introduces in her prologue, and found it rather representative of Eliot's idealistic bent.Dorothea, one of the protagonists, is compared throughout the novel to her. Saint Theresa was an idealistic religious mystic, who fought for reform in the church; Dorothea is similarly an idealistic dreamer, bent on reform, but totally out of touch with the practical realities of life. I think Saint Theresa probably mainly represents reform to Eliot, but also someone who led a dramatic, even heroic ""epic"" life, as the conclusion to the novel suggests. In the latter, Dorothea fails, she never does anything large or heroic, but Eliot suggest that change can also be wrought in smaller, multitudinous pervasive acts. As far as Eliot's illustration in the novel of the institution of marriage is concerned, her different portraits of marriage is various and complex, so the message she seems to bring across is that a marriage can be beneficial to the partners only under a certain set of circumstances: if the marriage fits in with society, but above all, that the two partners be suited to one another.Eliot herself knew only too well the sting of social disapproval, since she was forced to live with a still married man (Henry Lewes could not divorce due to religious reasons), and society in general, even her own family, cut her off because of this.Eliot is known for attempting to establish realism in her novels, and I think she does that well, but for one little niggle I have - that loud very visible intrusion that she as author makes into the narrative.This might be a thoughtful and thought-provoking work, but the best in English Literature? Not quite, in my book.For me there is too much narration and ""interference"" by the author's voice. I know this is part and parcel of Victorian writing, but really, when it's pages and pages apiece, it just becomes unbearable. Victor Hugo, one of my favorite authors, was also guilty of this, but somehow he does it more interestingly, and in less of a schoolmarmish tone. The novel would be more enjoyable if culled by about a quarter of all the pages of narration, (some events and scenes are really carried on in too much detail, like for instance the comments and reactions of the townspeople regarding Lydgate - a lot of it gets repetitive) and the tedious didactic commentary. It's like Eliot hits you over the head with the same hammer a few times, to make sure that what she's trying to get across sinks in properly.Eliot as author/narrator just glares at you from every page.Well, I salute all of you who actually read every unabridged word and still had the mental and emotional energy at the end, to give this book 5 stars. I subtracted at least 1 star for my gripes as mentioned above. :)No doubt MS Eliot AKA Evans/Cross was a very intelligent and learned lady, delightful to those who knew her personally, I'm sure, but her tone is simply too didactic for my tastes. However, given the scope she achieves, this novel is certainly a huge achievement.Bottom line - I reckon that all the work and erudition that went into this novel deserves a 4 at least, in spite of my grumbles. I also laud Eliot's reformist attitudes, so I suppose one should try and look past a less than pleasing style."

Cannot Read One More Page of Telling (Compared to Showing)Reading this now seems akin to being impelled to eat an overcooked steak with a plastic fork and butter knife . After months of pain, I put my finger on one of the reasons why. It was published in 1871 before the literary realism of Flaubert's 1856 Madame Bovary gained a foothold in the lit world. For example, something that especially drives me to the brink is Eliot's constant long-winded commentary on the dialogue and acts, e.g., on how what was said or done makes this female character feel and how she might have felt if she knew what he felt or if he'd instead said or done it a different way, or what the male character should believe the female character might think her mum is going to do in reaction to what the female tells her mum that he said, which might in turn lead to ""X"" or to ""Y."" Instead of giving the reader dialogue, descriptions and characters' inner thoughts from which the reader may draw conclusions, she tells the reader what to conclude, how to feel, etc. ad nauseam, which makes me shout, ""

I am very thankful for online summaries (Shmoop and Wikipedia) as they helped me gather and clarify my thoughts every few chapters or so.While this book is large, I am guessing the fact that it is broken up into several smaller ""books"" means that at the time it was released it was delivered to the public in easier to swallow chunks. I did not look this up to confirm, but it would make sense. Instead of being 1000 pages total, it would have been eight or nine 100 to 140 page episodes.Speaking of episodes, I think this book would make a good BBC mini-series and I think perhaps it already has. As a lot of the subject matter deals with medical care politics, I was reminded of the hospital storylines in Downton Abbey. And, while reading was a bit of a chore, I don't think a mini-series would be.Storywise, despite the book being long, the story itself is not very Epic. There are a few key plots focusing on about 4 or 5 characters, but when you reflect on it in the end, not a whole lot actually happens. In fact, the Wikipedia summary is only a few paragraphs. With that in mind, this is a good book for people who love the writing style of the time period because you get more of that than actual plot.If you like the classics and don't mind a formidable tome, Middlemarch is right up your alley!"
31,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53067896-amina,Rating 5 out of 5,"I have been sitting on this review for about a week. It's hard to put into words, an accurate review of a book that takes on the inner workings and minute details of a provincial town.George Eliot's masterpiece Middlemarch takes about 200 pages to even begin to understand the complexities of each character. The surprising fact is that slowly, without even realizing it, you learn something profound about yourself. Through the characters, you decide what you want to be, and then again what you don't. This book is about decency and goodness. I truly believe I would have been obsessed with Middlemarch in my 20s—learning to navigate my future. The characters, many of whom are young, are still coming to terms with their lives and the direction they want to take. It seemed so relatable. I wish someone had told me...
It is a narrow mind which cannot look at a subject from various points of view
Dorothea Brooke, by far my favorite flawed, yet beautiful character, resonated with me. Dorethea is young and honest, she wants to follow her path, but when she finds herself in tragic circumstances, she tries to make the best of it. She marries a much older man, Edward Casaubon. This marriage early on, sets the tone for the breadth of the book. She is like a trapped bird, living in this unhappy union, but still moving along. Dorothea meets Casaubon's cousin Will Ladislaw-- the two strike up a friendship. This friendship takes a direction that Dorothea is not willing to accept. Within these complicated relationships, George Elliot reminds us of the complexities and sacrifices of marriage. There is a good amount of attention put on married life; the hopes and disappointments.We also meet Teritus Lydgate, a doctor that is an idealist (like Dorothea) and not completely enamored with wealth. He meets the beautiful Rosamund, who thinks Lydgate will be this wealthy man, sweeping her off her feet. Lydgate, (to me), didn't seem like someone who should have been married. He seemed more than anything to be married to his work. The financial burdens and continuous commitment to his career, haunt him and propel him throughout the novel. I also enjoyed the character of Camden Farebrother, a vicar who helps many of the patrons of Middlemarch navigate the difficult moments in their lives. He seems like an overall good person, continuously giving up his dreams for the betterment of others. There are a multitude of interesting characters, but for the sake of sanity, I've touched upon a few of my favorites. The interesting thing about George Elliot's Middlemarch-- it's three different novels weaved into one. Somehow, in the end, the lives of most of the characters intertwine. When the character's finally meet, you feel vested in their relationships. There is so much detailed information given about each character's emotions and feelings, connecting you to their lives. It took me about 4 months to read Middlemarch. I would read and shelf it for a while, but every break drew me back into the lives of the Middlemarch characters. The ending seemed a bit abrupt and surprising in the direction each character turned, but isn't that life? Sometimes ordinary people can take extraordinary turns. I suppose that is why we always say to “expect the unexpected”.Middlemarch is a slow burn novel in its entirety. If you aren't committed to detailed prose and lengthy explanations, entwined with beautiful, eloquent writing, this may not be for you. The words are deep and layered with meaning, it takes time to take it all in. George Elliot explores every aspect of society; from money and greed to progress and reform. Middlemarch is a thorough explanation of all the workings of life in the mid-1800s.This quote resonated beautifully with me: 
 ""That by desiring what is perfectly good, even when we don't quite know what it is and cannot do what we would, we are part of the divine power against evil--widening the skirts of light and making the struggle with darkness narrower.""
I give Middlemarch 4 stars for the setting and plot with an additional star for being such a complex, detailed work of art by a woman who at the time had to disguise her gender to be relevant.5/5 stars"
32,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/117422922-axl-oswaldo,Rating 5 out of 5,"Once I finished reading Middlemarch the first thing I did was to send a message to a friend of mine who told me 'Middlemarch is a difficult read, Middlemarch is boring, it's not even a novel but an essay, I was almost halfway through the book and then I DNF it', and say to him that he was telling me some lies. First of all, Middlemarch is like any other Victorian novel, a story that is mainly depicting the lives of some inhabitants of a small town in England, in short, interpersonal relationships and human bonding; in fact, if I had to describe Middlemarch by saying a couple of words, those ones would be 'marriage and illusions' (perhaps I must not explain why I would choose these words, the reader will have to find out the answer by reading the book and perhaps they will agree with me). Second of all, Middlemarch is by no means a difficult read, or at least not a boring, tedious book; on the contrary, I would say Middlemarch is rather compelling and exciting, with a bunch of interesting characters and topics that are beautifully depicted and developed. As for the essay thing, it was not necessarily true: I was expecting Middlemarch to be an essay that was disguised as a novel, and not the other way around; I was expecting to find long non-fiction chapters focused on politics, society, maybe religion, and even when we have a long chapter talking about medicine, another one describing to a certain point the Reform Act (1832), and a third one focused on a candidate selection (politics), they were neither boring nor difficult to understand.At this point, I could tell why my friend was saying such things regarding this book to me: he is probably not into Victorian novels that much, which would explain his experience reading this novel. As for me, I'm a big sucker for Victorian literature, and so far I have read a decent amount of novels from that period of time (or at least, that's what I think). Actually, reading Middlemarch made me bring other reading experiences to mind, novels that are very similar to this George Eliot's book in terms of the content, for instance, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (Anne Brontë), North and South (Elizabeth Gaskell), He Knew He Was Right (Anthony Trollope), and a little of The Woman in White (Wilkie Collins) due to a secret that someone is keeping. It is true that I wouldn't recommend Middlemarch to anyone who wants to start reading Victorian novels, partly because of its length (800 pages or so), and partly because of the narrative that might be daunting at times. Here is when I would say Middlemarch becomes a 'unique' Victorian novel, since Eliot's writing style is absolutely thought-provoking and precise, even informative from beginning to end, where you can tell the author knows exactly what she is talking about, and in fact, the more she talks about this or that topic, the more you get captivated by the amount of things she knows. In other words, she is a complete genius.Even when Middlemarch as a town is the main protagonist of the novel—or at least this is my conclusion after finishing the book—the author is scarcely describing Middlemarch, physically speaking. We know Middlemarch because of its people, because of their relationships and because of their characteristics as a community. Now, here is when the subtitle of the novel makes completely sense ('A Study of Provincial Life') since the author is portraying beautifully and meticulously the life of these people in the countryside, their behavior along with their thoughts, beliefs, interests, and the like. Complex, memorable and very well developed characters such as Dorothea, Lydgate, Rosamond, and Will Ladislaw are impossible to forget, being those kinds of characters who you always care about, and furthermore, it's difficult not to empathize with them since they are really palpable and profound. In a nutshell, Middlemarch is an unforgettable reading experience, probably one of the best Victorian novels ever written, and a book you have to read at least once in your life. In my case, I buddy-read this one with a good friend of mine—the same guy who I read The Golden Bowl with—and he was also surprised when he found an understandable yet complex story here; as I said before, don't be afraid of giving it a go, don't think Middlemarch is boring, confusing, tedious, or things of that kind. Even, I would say there is one subplot in the novel that is incredibly gossipy, and my friend and I agreed that Eliot's sense of humor is so spot on.Needles to say I'd wholeheartedly recommend Middlemarch* to someone who has read some Victorian novels beforehand, you know, just in case.* You could tell me, if you want, how many times I said 'Middlemarch' in my entire review... just kidding (it was on purpose, by the way).P. S. I almost forgot to recommend the audiobook I listened this time. There is one on Audible that was my first pick; I'd say it was okayish, but the reason why I don't recommend that one is because the narrator is skipping all the epigraphs!, and literally every chapter in this novel has an epigraph. It was kinda disappointing, therefore I decided to do that one on LibriVox, narrated by Margaret Espalliat; this one, despite being free, was much better: a great voice, good pace and the narrator is actually reading the epigraphs. So, this one was my choice from the first third(?) of the book until the end. A great version that brings the story to life, so to speak. ----Favorite quotes:It is so painful in you ... that you will look at human beings as if they were merely animals with a toilette, and never see the great soul in a man’s face.We mortals, men and women, devour many a disappointment between breakfast and dinner-time; keep back the tears and look a little pale about the lips, and in answer to inquiries say, ‘Oh, nothing!’ Pride helps us; and pride is not a bad thing when it only urges us to hide our own hurts–not to hurt others.If I did love you, I would not marry you: I would certainly not promise ever to marry you.What have you had such an education for, if you are to go and marry a poor man? It’s a cruel thing for a father to see.They were bound to each other by a love stronger than any impulses which could have marred it.Indeed we are most of us brought up in the notion that the highest motive for not doing a wrong is something irrespective of the beings who would suffer the wrong.All existence seemed to beat with a lower pulse than her own, and her religious faith was a solitary cry, the struggle out of a nightmare in which every object was withering and shrinking away from her.There are answers which, in turning away wrath, only send it to the other end of the room, and to have a discussion coolly waived when you feel that justice is all on your own side is even more exasperating in marriage than in philosophy.The soul of man, when it gets fairly rotten, will bear you all sorts of poisonous toad-stools, and no eye can see whence came the seed thereof."
33,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/381149-martine,Rating 5 out of 5,"Widely regarded as the quintessential Victorian novel, Middlemarch is a superb study of life among the upper and upper middle classes of a fictional rural community in 1830s England. It takes 900 pages to draw its conclusions, but they're 900 pages of some of the richest realist writing nineteenth-century literature has to offer, full of insights into society, human nature, what to do in life when one can't quite make one's dreams come true, and how to make a marriage work. I've seen it described as a book everyone should read before getting married, and I agree -- all the lessons you need to learn about human relationships are in here, and much more besides.To a large extent, the success of Middlemarch is due to its characterisation. A character-driven novel if ever I saw one, Middlemarch features some of the most memorable characters Eliot ever came up with: an earnest young lady who wishes to make a difference; her husband, a petty and jealous scholar; a hot-tempered doctor who is a little ahead of his time; his wife, a living embodiment of the fact that pretty girls don't always make the best spouses; a pious banker who is not the good Christian he has always professed to be; his nephew, who desperately wishes to win the heart of the girl he loves despite his mounting gambling debts; a talented outsider who doesn't quite know how to make the most of his gifts -- they're all here, and they're described in admirable detail. Like a scientist, Eliot puts her characters under a microscope, describing their every flaw and weakness, but always in a sympathetic way; even her worst characters have redeeming features, which makes it very easy to take an interest in their vicissitudes. Like an anthropologist, she then puts her characters into a socio-cultural context, showing the whole through the parts and the parts through the whole. The historical background (political changes, the industrial revolution, new medical theories) is magnificently drawn, and the stories (there are many here) are as fine as they come, featuring love triangles, thwarted prospects, intrigue, political aspirations, blackmail, gossip, characters meddling in other people's lives from beyond the grave, and a clash between old values and modern science and technology. Granted, the book takes a while to hit its stride, but once it does, it's unputdownable. As for shortcomings, one could say that Eliot is occasionally a tad too intellectual for her own good. Frightfully well-read herself, she sometimes has her characters refer to things which seem a bit outside their scope. Likewise, she occasionally loses herself in technical and political details which slightly detract from the main stories, and takes so much time setting the scene for the great developments which are to follow later that the first half of the book is a tad dull. The second half is brilliant, though -- up there with the great French and Russian realist classics of the period, and then some. It's not the easiest read, but a patient reader will be amply rewarded for his/her trouble, especially if he/she takes the trouble the read the book more than once. Middlemarch is one of those books which yield new gems every time one reads them, and I cherish it for that."

The novel provides one of the finest studies of place and character ever put into words, which was amazing. But at times, Elliot handed just a bit too much focus to the minute details of Middlemarch and its people, and for that, it loses a star."

That being said, this book was amazing. Also long, extremely long and I had to make myself read it but once I got into it... there was no going back. I’ve been in a reading funk of sorts for the past couple of months and I’ve found pretty much everything I read unsatisfying, until this (and that’s saying something, since I started about 50 books give or take which I’ve since abandoned) I gave myself time and space to really savour this a few pages a day and it only made the experience of reading it even more pleasant.There’s a lot of thoughts and ideas in there. A lot of reflection and a lot of realism.What baffles and amazes me is that no matter the times we live in, the human condition never really changes. We are slaves to the same emotions, worries, problems, needs and wants. I don’t plan on expanding much in this review since, this is a classic and there’s plenty of reviews already for reference. I just wanted to make a note of my enjoyment of it in case I decide to pick it up again in the future. As far as English classics go, this is a winner."

Asistimos, acompañados de los irónicos comentarios de la propia autora, al devenir de diversos personajes, multitud de tramas que poco a poco irán confluyendo para dar lugar a una obra titánica, que, no lo voy a negar, puede abrumar en sus primeras cien páginas. Pero ¿Qué novela que ronda las mil páginas no impone? El caso es que una vez que nos habituamos al estilo de la autora y pasado el lío de nombres y parentesco (EDITORIAL ALBA QUÉ MENOS QUE UN LISTADO DE PERSONAJES, PERO NO), empiezas a disfrutar con esas descripciones de lugares y personas tan pintorescas como reales. Todos los personajes terminaron resultándome maravillosos y eso que al principio del libro muchos me resultaban insufribles... ¡Aquí tenemos una buena evolución de personajes, amigos! Desde luego la autora realiza un estudio minucioso de las personas y de la vida en el campo, del matrimonio que no siempre tiene que ser feliz, de las constantes peleas entre la ciencia y la religión, de los cotilleos y los oscuros secretos, de las familias, de los amores imposibles... En este libro hay sitio para todo, cuando lo terminas tienes la sensación de haber leído algo trascendental.'Middlemarch' tiene un poco de Thomas Hardy, tiene algo de Elizabeth Gaskell y también algo de Jane Austen... Es un libro que me ha encantado.Y pronto haré reseña en el canal :)"

George Eliot’s Middlemarch sets out to create a commentary of provincial life, and with such great detail and narrative arc, achieves just that. Each character represents a pillar of community and their varying storylines reflect all corners of society, from relationships to finance and class- the significant elements of societal gossip against an 1800s background. With this, Eliot also explores the role of women, in both marriage and money, their found happiness or lack of, the controversy of choice, independence. The female characters of Middlemarch demonstrate poignant insight into the emotional sides of each narrative, wrapped up in beautifully written philosophy and resonating sentiment.With this read, you begin to feel embedded in the culture of Middlemarch, it’s politics, economics, the people that reside, you generate opinions, bonds- a truly special experience."

Each crisis seems final, simply because it is new. We are told that the oldest inhabitants in Peru do not cease to be agitated by earthquakes, but they probably see beyond each shock and reflect that there are plenty more to come."" A recent BBC poll of literary critics designated Middlemarch, George Eliot's magnum opus, as the best British Victorian novel. Virginia Woolf described it as ""one of the few written for grown-ups."" Frightened by its length, I allowed the book to languish on my shelves for many years. Then, a little over two weeks ago, I tore the meniscus in my left knee, and faced with the open time immobility provides, I decided to tackle Middlemarch. I loved it!The story takes place in the 1830s, at the beginning of industrialization in the fictional English village of Middlemarch. It is a time of change. The novel examines relationships, the institution of marriage, women's roles, social class, and the impact of social norms on the interconnected lives of the village inhabitants. For me, what stood out was the vivid characterization. George Eliot (pseudonym for Marian Evans) provides a subtle and nuanced portrait of human motivation and interaction. In his New Criterion essay, critic Myron Magnet captures the essence of skill when he states what he believes Eliot does best:  In this 1871 novel, George Eliot shows how our  inner feelings and wishes interact with our outer 			 				 	 circumstances, with the social-cultural climate that  surrounds us and with our personal relationships to shape our identity and fate.While I don't want to attempt a plot summary of a close-to 900-page novel, I must add that I felt a sense of sadness when I finished the book, as if I was saying goodbye to people I knew and had come to understand. I decided to watch the BBC adaptation of the book. It is interesting to see how others understand and portray a book I so enjoyed."

Middlemarch, written in 1869-1871 but set in 1829-1832, has remained a classic due to its universality. The ignoble traits of humans as well as their honorable characteristics are recorded throughout history and will be well into the future. Many writers have been keen observers of mankind, but not many have the precision of George Eliot. With a wink of her eye, I felt love, understanding, and an acceptance of her characters. Never judgmental, Eliot’s subtle humor often had me smiling. The town gossip, religious hypocrite, sanctimonious snob, egotistical (but clever) femme fatale, reformer, rascal, and unjustly accused are all represented. Two characters are ostracized from Middlemarch, much like the author and Georges Llewes were spurned by their social class. It is hard to read this novel and not think how little human nature has changed.I learned much about the author’s life having recently read Parallel Lives. This greatly enhanced my reading of this masterpiece. Eliot was intelligent and well-read. She was not a great beauty. Her character Mary Garth seemed to me to be created in her image. All the women in this story are depicted as having positive attributes, not their ability to pour tea elegantly, but they were clever, witty, earnest, and/or ingenious. This alone was refreshing to read in a novel from that time period.Overall, I loved this novel, but the first 100 pages of the 736 took much effort. Eliot’s extensive vocabulary, complex and unusually long sentences, and archaic terminology made it very slow paced initially. I thought I would shoot myself before I finished, definitely not the 4 star review I finally rated it. I became accustomed to her style, an admirer of her command of the language, enamored by the characters. I’m sure the audio version is less arduous, but I loved being able to read and reread those beautifully constructed lines.""For the fragment of a life, however typical, is not the sample of an even web: promises may not be kept, and an ardent outset may be followed by declension; latent powers may find their long-awaited opportunity; a past error may urge a grand retrieval."""
41,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5512657-sara,Rating 5 out of 5,"I finished Middlemarch last night, and I put it down with a sigh made of slight fatigue and complete satisfaction. I have never taken a full month to read a book, and that this one took that long is due in part to the very slow pace of the first half of the novel.Eliot lays us a detailed picture of an entire town and all the people in it. She does not skimp on a single person, so that we know her major characters well, but we also know her secondary characters well. Even the characters who populate the fringe of the novel, like Mrs. Garth, feel full-blown and real. In painting them so thoroughly, she helps us to feel their joys and sorrows, frustrations and accomplishments, and recognize their strengths and weaknesses. Not one character is a caricature, and oh how easily Mr. Casaubon could have gone there. All that character development feels slightly tedious in the beginning, but the payoff is stupendous. We are introduced to Dorothea Brooke at the outset of this novel and we do not realize it, but we have just met one of the greatest characters in English literature. She is perfection, without being perfect, because she is a person who struggles to find a meaningful life. She makes mistakes (whoppers) along the way, but she never gives up on her belief that she can count for something and in doing so lighten another's load or help them to count as well. That Eliot gives us Dorothea without any preaching or proselytizing is remarkable. That she does so without making Dorothea seem wooden is remarkable. That she paints us a world in which Dorothea exists with other human beings who are equally believable is masterful.Obviously, I loved Middlemarch. I think The Mill on the Floss is still my favorite Eliot, but that is comparing one treasure to another and the thing that separates them is probably only that we always lean toward our first love."
42,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,No Rating," Reform, relationships, & railwaysRebecca Mead in The Road to Middlemarch described her longing to grow up and be the kind of person who loved Middlemarch, but maybe one finds that one is the kind of person who would prefer to be sipping hot chocolate and flicking through Tintin books  and if that is you, well that is a good life too, there is one way to find out and that is to read, or in my case re-read, George Eliot's mighty novel.Reading again I find that either Middlemarch has been comprehensively revised and in places re-written or that it has changed in a quite curious way in my imagination in the twenty or so years since I first read it. Now having closed the covers on the last words again, I think I could start it over and read it again, even more slowly looking for the balances and closed character circles that seem typical and at variance with the narrative as a whole but I will not because the library wants it back.Written about the time of the parliamentary reform act of the 186os the novel looks back on the period of the 1832 parliamentary reform Act, while characters can be since as travelling round circles either finishing opposite to where they started, others travel completely around the circle and end back where they started, the world of Middlemarch is itself a closed and viscous circle - inward looking and constrained - it is rocked (softly) by the air of reform - agricultural prices are depressed by the end of the Corn Laws, Catholic emancipation is still ruffling feathers, the prospect of parliamentary reform threatens excitement and change, even while the railway cuts closer and closer through the landscape and we expect that the town and surviving countryside will be changed utterly just as soon as we close the book and let the characters get on with their lives within their paper world. Perhaps as is suggested during the novel what is needed is change to the constitution, continuing as they have done for so long is the worst of all ideas, but this is a novel about people, not the big P politics of the Whigs and Tories.As a story, it is really not much at all, very conventional - three couples (two of which are emotional triads for part of the story) who we see as single persons and then their married lives through various troubles and trials, Eliot steps up the social ladder from her earlier novels she is dealing - true to the title with middle class people in middle England and it is unmistakably an English novel and not a British one, there are some voices of poorer people but we are mostly concerned with people who deal with paper money and cheques. Despite all this it is a compelling, compulsive read.I don't remember how precisely the novel struck me the first time I read it, perhaps I was simply awestruck and pigeon holed it as a significant novel while it grew in my imagination. It feels now less like a book that I have read, more like an experience I have lived through.As you might expect in a story focusing on middle class characters money and marriage, money and marriage go together like a horse and carriage. And the apparent or actual absence of money either makes relations impossible or brings them to breaking point, love in this novel does not conquer anything at best it can help people wait.George Elliot as a young woman withdrew from the Church of England and from formal religious practise, writing as she did in the great age of British church building she is always oblique about her own lack of faith, as demonstrated here in the three clergymen that we see fairly closely - they are all three decent men, one a companionable phlegmatic fellow and enthusiastic fisherman, another for years supplemented his meagre income by winning money in card games, while the third is completely lost in musing over world mythology. They are typical of the town of Middlemarch, insular and unconvincing as spiritual leaders the novel as a teacher of post Christian ethics see for instance the influence of Spinoza (chapter 80 in particular) .Spiritual heroism in the story is represented above all by Dorothea  nomen est omenBrook , for a while by the idealistic Doctor Lydgate, and to an extent by Will Laidslaw  Will is partly Jewish and partly Polish by descent rendering him doubly foreign and a literal outsider, which puts me in mind of Shirley in which story again it is the foreigner from mainland Europe who is shaking up the islanders with their narrow insular ways. The last two are outsiders who come to Middlemarch, they have broader perspectives than the Middlemarchers. Looking at Middlemarch, we might say that if the a relationship is not based on actual compatibility then it must be by default transactional or rely on a dynamic of dominance and submission, the cost of Lydgate's marriage is his soul, it is Dorothea who is to be the St.Teresa (of Avila) of this story, the time and the place limit her scope, her spiritual energy can only flow in certain limited ways - but the last words of the novel are a paean to the Dorotheas of the world making life better for all of us through their lives. If she is the heart of the novel, the rest of it shows why her impact is going to be limited  the choice of a Catholic counter-Reformation saint as Eliot's spiritual role model is typical of her pushing towards non-conformity even in the little details.I wonder if in the story of Dorothea's marriage to cramped and withered clergyman Casaubon, Eliot is showing us the opposite of what she did in Silas Marner, there the isolated miser is transformed through his love, here, perhaps Casaubon is too soured or dried up, or too isolated from his feelings by his (mis)education and social status, but instead he remains within himself a frightened little child.This grand novel is didactic, Eliot insists on showing sympathy and creating understanding for most of her characters  apart from the minor ones, the love story between Dorothea and Will is surprisingly formulaic  initial dislike, chance meetings, growing appreciation, miscommunications/non-communications - (on the other hand if we follow the money Eliot's sexual politics is at variance with the legal position of Victorian women - there may be romance and passion but that does not mean in the happier relationships that Eliot describes that 'the Angel in the house' can not also be the chancellor of the (household) exchequer and at the same time in an unhappy relationship it is precisely by performing 'the Angel in the House' and refusing to talk pounds, shillings and pence, that the wife becomes the dominant partner in the relationship) but for me it works, a treasurehouse of a book, I can believe in the inner lives of the characters (excepting the minor ones whose roles are too minor to know them), it was worth reading and reading again, I can imagine it would repay further readings too."

44,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57003346-matthew-ted,Rating 5 out of 5,"6th book of 2021. Paintings in this review by English painter Augustus Walford Weedon.Woolf famously said that Middlemarch is ""one of the few English novels written for grownup people"", and I finally see what she means by that. Or at least I think I do. When my mother was about my age she used to look at her parents and their friends and think to herself, You’re an adult when you start to talk about your recycling. She remembers her parents comparing what they could recycle compared to their friends from different areas, or what day the bins were put out. To my young mother, that was adulthood. Funnily enough, she is self-aware enough to exclaim, “Kill me now!” when she realises she is talking to guests about the recycling and my brother and I are sat watching, mildly bemused. So, by her own standards, my mother has reached adulthood, and did a long time ago. In a way this idea is what I imagined Woolf was talking about: Middlemarch addresses many themes, but there are many parts of the novel dedicated to the running of this fictional town, its politics, its buildings, its hospital…And in a way I felt as if I was a boy watching adults talk about the recycling.   “Paesaggio Lacustre”—1894As Victorian novels go, I was surprised. My old housemate recently finished the novel and asked me to dig up a letter from a young Martin Amis which I had shown him a couple of years ago when I read his memoir Experience—in which a young Amis brags about reading Middlemarch in 3 days to his father and describes it as: FUCKING good — Jane Austen + Passion + Dimension. Very fine. Amis puts it bluntly, and crudely, but he isn’t massively wrong. I preferred this to what I’ve read of Austen. There are two, maybe three, main reasons why:Firstly, Eliot has a sharp wit which weaves it way in and out of the pages. In a Victorian fashion, the “I”, Eliot, enters the story to pass her own judgements on what is happening, though only infrequently. The dialogue is clean and engaging, even when talking about the Reform Bill (the novel’s version of talking about the recycling); and dialogue takes up a large portion of the prose. Eliot rarely bothers to describe a room or a character’s surroundings. Sometimes a paragraph opens seemingly mid-conversation and other than being aware of who is talking, that is all we are offered. One person maybe leaning against a fireplace (they are inside then) and another may be looking out of the window at the rain (it is raining then) but that is all Eliot thinks necessary. This dialogue-heavy prose makes the novel surprisingly easy to read. Its size is deceptive. However, when Eliot does bother to give us slightly more of the setting, we feel grateful: 
…the black figure with hands behind and head bent forward continued to pace the walk where the dark yew-trees gave him a mute companionship in melancholy, and the little shadows of bird or leaf that fleeted across the isles of sunlight, stole among in silence as in the presence of sorrow.
The other principal reason is because of the small grains of Eliot’s philosophy. I found many of the characters’ conversations enthralling, and especially near the beginning, found myself underlining a lot of passages. I read somewhere that critics of the time were put-off by the novel and its constant literary and philosophical allusions, thinking it bizarre and unnatural for a woman’s novel to be so “smart”. Eliot had a hard time with that, it seems, as well as now being infamously remembered for being “ugly”—Henry James called her “magnificently ugly, deliciously hideous.” He also called Middlemarch ""at once one of the strongest and one of the weakest of English novels.”  “Storm Clouds Over Pevensey”—1880James, ignoring his cruel comments on Eliot’s appearance, makes an interesting point on the novel. At times it is overly long (though I partially expect, and forgive that from the 19th century) and at times the novel becomes a little loose, and perhaps loses its way slightly. Towards the end, rather than speeding up as I usually do, to reach the climactic moments and resolutions, I found that I was slowing down. Eliot descended into telling prose and insignificant characters gossiping about recent events, which as the reader, we had just read first-hand. The novel’s ending sentiment made the final, slightly disappointing, journey worthwhile though. Eliot conjures great characters and sets Middlemarch against and around the 1832 Reform Act, early railway construction, cholera and ideas and philosophy of medicine at the time, through the rather interesting character of Lydgate. Where the novel is loose, I will also say at other times it stretches at the seams, addressing ideas I didn’t expect to find in a novel of its time. It could even be our (England's) greatest novel. I've let it soak in my mind for a long time now and it only reinforces my already high opinions of it. I want to end with some snatches of dialogue I have found underlined in my copy as I leaf back through it:
 “It is painful to be told that anything is very fine and not be able to feel that it is fine—something like being blind, while people talk of the sky.”“But selfish people always think their own discomfort of more importance than anything in the world.”“…you must love your work, and not be always looking over the edge of it, wanting your play to begin. And the other is, you must not be ashamed of your work, and think it would be more honourable to you to be doing something else. You must have a pride in your own work and in learning to do it well, and not be always saying, There’s this and there’s that—if I had this or that to do, I might make something of it.”“I am not quite sure whether clever men ever dance.”“Oh, he dreams footnotes, and they run away with all his brains.”“After all, people may really have in them some vocation which is not quite plain to themselves, may they not? They may seem idle and weak because they are growing. We should be very patient with each other, I think.”He was one of the rarer lads who early get a decided bent and make up their minds that there is something particular in life which they would like to do for its own sake, and not because their fathers did it. Most of us who turn to any subject we love remember some morning or evening hour when we got on a high stool to reach down an untried volume, or sat with parted lips listening to a new talker, or for very lack of books began to listen to the voices within, as the first traceable beginning of our love.
I could write many more but I won’t. Though I don’t want to spoil the theme of Middlemarch, or one of its themes, that becomes clear at the end, I would like to simply say that Eliot urges us to live our lives in hope of finding something we love, and not worrying about any grander design. To live a relatively normal life is, perhaps, the greatest thing we owe ourselves."

I have not taken a bribe yet. But there is a pale shade of bribery which is sometimes called prosperity.
The afterword to my edition compared one of its many cruxes, this one dealing with the slow grave robbing of sin, to the machinations of Macbeth. I will raise those stakes from plot device to the narratology of equivocation: Shakespeare, previously under investigation for suspected connection to the Gunpowder Plot, currently in the thrall of absolutist witch hunter King James, is made to write a play. Antigone is not Dorothea as Shakespeare is not Mary Ann Evans, but the ideal that spreads through science and reform and literature still bumps up against colonialism and antisemitism and orientalism with nary a flickering of the critical gaze. Blink and you'll miss this amongst the much, much, much else of the quotidian world there is to see, but when such a humanitarian intellect has its tropes, therein lies equivocation.
Our sense of duty must often wait for some work which shall take the place of dilettantism and make us feel that the quality of our action is not a matter of indifference.
I start with the lackluster to demonstrate how one may take in all without losing one's shit over the people whose differing personal stakes means taking this book at the usual level of academic would mean a sacrifice in their realm of the physiological. This work is great because of the effort, because of the reach, because ""the sign of the times"" wasn't used as an excuse to stick to the safety of domestic over here, politics over there, skimming the surface of the banal and forgoing pulling up the roots for generating the Other. If you want to assure me all's well and good in the land of canonical English literature, bring me the likes of this and Lear and Canterbury, where the existence of said Others does not preclude a lack of bashing one's skull into the rock in order to get at its maser, meaner, more equivocating instincts. Doctors do the devil's work, riots couldn't possibly fulfill an ethical purpose, the matters of politics must always be off limits cause no one died by keeping mum. You can't talk gender and class and heretical leanings in any way other than the prescriptivist in the halls of classical literature, let alone discomfort without offering an answer. It would be weak. It would be vulgar. It would be too close a demonstration of the author's own sleepless nights spent wrestling over the questions of the realities of women, the violence of poverty, and the part God plays in all of it.
Obligation may be stretched till it is no better than a brand of slavery stamped on us when we were too young to know its meaning.
Does Evans succeed? Does Eliot succeed? The world succeeds in calling her the latter, until I remind myself that my ""world"" is a tiny fraction of the population that has only been on top for an even tinier fraction of oblivion-exploded time. Then it, as it always will be until we've cracked the mathematical code of brain waves, fear chemicals, and the fabric of those apocalypses we like to pretend we've tamed into natural disasters, is natural selection. Write long enough of a tale that interweaves as many of those systems of order we fragile humans tuck ourselves to bed under as does Middlemarch, and you'll get a inkling what we've lost by splitting it into facts, then fields, then categories, then major requirements, then job description, then experience, then a way of putting food on the table. We may not yet be able to calculate the random to the point that purity or supremacy or hierarchy on the human level is intrinsically understood and may be taught from grade school to be the surest way to annihilation, we may still pay those to demonstrate understanding without an ability to transmute the most ""difficult"" concept to the grasp of a ten-year-old, but connection. But voice. I am not one of the ones who believe that a death of the old guard will guarantee the eradication of bigotry and all its cries of ""rationality"" (try reclaiming the mad and the crazed and the insane in the halls of the Millennials and see how far you get), but one who knows what it's like to live in a state where the smallest comment in the smallest corner of the Internet justifies the world entire. As Dorothea said, you would have to feel with me, else you would never know.

""No dear, you would have to feel with me, else you would never know.""-DorotheaAny idiot can face a crisis; it's this day-to-day living that wears you out. -Anton Chekhov
A week ago, I had been having a fruitful discussion with a dear friend about the wide reaching parameters of social justice (my favorite), when I noticed a reoccurring theme. Boil all the difficulties down into the components of society, then humanity, then the mind, and you get a single word of surprising power: perspective. It was an idea that I had never seriously considered in its fullest capacity, and it is a coincidental fortune that I had been reading Middlemarch at the time, a book that exemplifies this curious construct that belongs to all and as a result holds a mighty sway over the complexities of daily life.There are many books that choose an event of deep and bone-quaking significance and extrapolate, playing out through the combination of imagination and reasoning a story of coping with such and such disaster, crises of faith, function, and physical form. The severely destabilized environment offers a fireswept soil for fertile thoughts, which coupled with the reader's attempt to grapple with whatever disaster is in the pages makes for a powerful method of delivering lessons to a receptive mind, should they find them agreeable. However, the issue lies in the fact that whatever diabolical happenstance the author chooses, it is something that is not frequently encountered by the majority of audience, and the learning is less likely to stick if the occasion never arises. This is where books like this one, trenchant in the daily life and seeming mundanities with a concern no less piercingly compassionate than those who find success in concerning themselves with the more vicious calamities, become incalculably valuable.The grand experiment of life. You are as a result, as am I, and countless others. Many are collected in this book concerned with the English provincial life of the 1830's, a time long gone in a country that I for one have never lived in. What all these human beings hold in common with I and you, dear reader, are the rules by which they live, and the selves by which they are alive. What they may not have in common, or at least they do not with me, is the sensitive web of information that runs through their community, and the ways by which the inhabitants treat this information, their perspective of things. More often than not, if the title of Middlemarch been replaced with that of Vanity Fair, the implications would be no farther off from the story told.Men, women, and the disparate channels by which it is ""proper"" for them to run. Noblemen, farmers, and the methods by which those of different classes see fit to formulate their interactions. Priests, scientists, and the surprising paths faith will make itself known along the lines of knowledge both blessed and dissected. Youth, age, and the impossible question of determining who knows ""best"", and for whom. Intelligence, integrity, and the definitions of such valued institutions that choke on pride as quickly as they culture it. The character of hope, the calumnies of coincidence, and all the stories spawned out of a breath that breed as fast as flies and leech opportunities for triumph into broken faith and resignation no less despicable or undeserved than the severest injustice. Your sense of self, your lot in life, two dice that fall in an infinity of possibilities where success cannot define itself by the standards of society alone, no matter how much it may beg and plead.

There is a power in seeing the story behind each and every one of these individuals, as great a power in seeing and accepting that the compatibility of one's self varies with each and every of these souls, by dint of the facts of their existence as much as one's own. There is a power in judgment in light of the fair and the true, as great a power as reserving said judgment in light of the lack of the fair and the true, despite the judge's inexperience with said lack of the fair and the true. There is a power in the viewing of the great events with careful consideration, as great a power in the viewing of the small highs and the small lows with as careful, perhaps even moreso due to the increased resonance one's own life may have with said small highs and lows. There is a power in resignation to the woes of tragic realities, and an equal power in acceptance of the small coincidences whose resulting happiness does not lower the possibility of their happenstance in the slightest. There is a power in saying that the author of this book is Mary Ann Evans Cross, and an equal power in saying that it is George Eliot, although this particular writer prefers the former for reasons fully reconciled with their being. As there is as great a power in saying, read this, and wipe all thoughts of soap operas and petty tales of petty concerns from your assumptions and standards of judgment. There is a voice here that occupies itself with empathy as much as it does with truth, with hope as much as despair, with faith in humanity as much as deep insight into the human condition. And she will not be denied."

Some gentlemen have made an amazing figure in literature by general discontent with the universe as a trap of dullness into which their great souls have fallen by mistake; but the sense of a stupendous self and an insignificant world may have its consolations.
I did not think a book like this was possible. A work of fiction with a thesis statement, a narrator who analyzes more often than describes, a morality play and an existential drama, and all this in the context of a realistic, historical novel—such a combination seems unwieldy and pretentious, to say the least. Yet Middlemarch never struck me as over-reaching or overly ambitious. Eliot not only manages to make this piece of universal art seem plausible, but her mastery is so perfect that the result is as natural and inevitable as a lullaby.Eliot begins her story with a question: What would happen if a woman with the spiritual ardor of St. Theresa were born in 19th century rural England? This woman is Dorothea; and this book, although it includes dozens of characters, is her story. But Dorothea, and the rest of the people who populate her Middlemarch, is not only a character; she is a test-subject in a massive thought experiment, an examination intended to answer several questions: To what extent is an individual responsible for her success or failure? How exactly does the social environment act upon the individual—in daily words and deeds—to aid or impede her potential? And how, in turn, does the potent individual act to alter her environment? What does it mean to be a failure, and what does it mean to be successful? And in the absence of a coherent social faith, as Christianity receded, what does it mean to be good?As in any social experiment, we must have an experimental group, in the form of Dorothea, as well as a control group, in the form of Lydgate. The two are alike in their ambition. Lydgate’s ambition is for knowledge. He is a country doctor, but he longs to do important medical research, to pioneer new methods of treatment, and to solve the mysteries of sickness, death, and the human frame. Dorothea’s ambitions are more vague and spiritual. She is full of passionate longing, a hunger for something which would give coherence and meaning to her life, an object to which she could dedicate herself body and soul.Lydgate begins with many advantages. For one, his mission is not a vague hope, but a concrete goal, the path to which he can chart and see clearly. Even more important, he is a man from a respectable family. Yes, there is some prejudice against him in Middlemarch, for being an outsider, educated abroad and with strange notions; but this barrier can hardly be compared with the those which faced even the most privileged woman in Middlemarch. For her part, Dorothea is born into a respectable family with adequate means. But her sex closes so many paths to action that the only important decision she can make is whom she will marry.Dorothea’s choice of a husband sets the tone for the rest of her story. Faced with two options—the young, handsome, and rich Sir James Chettam, and the dry, old scholar, Mr. Casaubon—she surprises and disappoints nearly everyone by choosing the latter. Moreover, she doesn't even hesitate to make this choice, insisting on a short engagement and a prompt wedding. Dorothea does this because she knows herself and she trusts herself; she is not afraid of being judged, and she does not care about status or wealth. The first important decision Lydgate makes is who to recommend as chaplain for the new hospital, and this, too, sets the tone for the rest of his story. His choice is between Mr. Tyke, a disagreeable, doctrinaire puritan, and Mr. Farebrother, his friend and an honest, humane, and intelligent man. Lydgate’s inclination is towards the latter, but under pressure from Bulstrode, the rich financier of the new hospital, Lydgate chooses Mr. Tyke. In other words, he distinctly does not trust himself, and he allows his intuition of right and wrong to be swayed by public opinion and self-interest. Also note that, unlike Dorothea, Lydgate agonizes over the decision for weeks and only finally commits himself in the final moment.Dorothea’s choice soon turns out to be disastrous, while Lydgate’s works in his favor, as Bulstrode puts him in charge of the new hospital. Yet Eliot shows us that Dorothea’s choice was ultimately right and Lydgate’s ultimately wrong. For we cannot know beforehand how our choices will turn out; the future is hidden, and we must dedicate ourselves to both people and projects in ignorance. The determining factor is not whether it turned out well for you, but whether the choice was motivated by brave resolve or cowardly capitulation. You might say that this is the existentialist theme of Eliot’s novel: the necessity to act boldly in the absence of knowledge. Dorothea’s act was bold and courageous; and even though Mr. Casaubon is soon revealed to be a wearisome, passionless, and selfish academic, her choice was nonetheless right, because she did her best to act authentically, fully in accordance with her moral intuition. Lydgate’s choice, even though it benefited him, established a pattern that ends in his bitter disappointment. He allowed himself to yield to circumstances; he allowed his self-interest to overrule his moral intuition: and this dooms him.(Eliot, I should mention, seems to prefer what philosophers call an intuitionist view of moral action: that is, we must obey our conscience. Time and again Eliot shows how immoral acts are made to appear justified through conscious reasoning, and how hypocrites use religious or social ideologies to quiet their uneasy inner voice: “when gratitude becomes a matter of reasoning there are many ways of escaping from its bonds.” Thus the authentic Dorothea acts unhesitatingly while the inauthentic Lydgate constantly vacillates.)Eliot’s view of success or failure stems from this exploration of choice: success means being true to one’s moral intuition, and failure means betraying it. Dorothea continues to trust herself and to choose boldly, without regard for her worldly well-being or for conventional opinion. Lydgate, meanwhile, keeps buckling under pressure. He marries almost by accident, breaking a strong resolution he made beforehand, and then goes on to betray, one after the other, every other strong resolution of his, until his life’s plan has been lost entirely, chipped away by a thousand small circumstances.Dorothea ends up on a lower social level than she started, married to an eccentric man of questionable blood, gossiped about in town and widely seen as a social failure. Lydgate, meanwhile, becomes “successful”; his beautiful wife is universally admired, and his practice is profitable and popular. But this conventional judgment means nothing; for Dorothea can live in good conscience, while Lydgate cannot.But is success, for Eliot, so entirely dependent on intention, and so entirely divorced from results? Not exactly. For the person who is true to her moral intuition—even if she fails in her plans, even if she falls far short of her potential, and even if she is disgraced in the eyes of society—still exerts a beneficent effect on her surroundings.Anyone who selflessly and boldly follows her moral intuition encourages everyone she meets, however subtly, to follow this example: as Eliot says of Dorothea, “the effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive.” Eliot shows this most touchingly in the meeting between Dorothea and Rosamond. Although Rosamond is vain, selfish, and superficial, the presence of Dorothea prompts her to one of the only unselfish acts of her life. From reading this review, you might get the idea that this book is merely a philosophical exercise. But Eliot’s most miraculous accomplishment is to combine this analysis with an immaculate novel. The portrait she gives of Middlemarch is so fully realized, without any hint of strain or artifice, that the reader feels that he has bought a cottage there himself. Normally at this point in a review, I add some criticisms; but I cannot think of a single bad thing to say about this book. Eliot’s command of dialogue and characterization, of pacing and plot-development, cannot be faulted. She moves effortlessly from scene to scene, from storyline to storyline, showing how the private is interwoven with the public, the social with the psychological, the economical with the amorous—how our vices are implicated in our virtues, how our good intentions are shot through with ulterior motives, how our hopes and fears are mixed up with our routine reality—never simplifying the ambiguities of perspective or collapsing the many layers of meaning—and yet she is always in perfect command of her mountains of material. A host of minor characters marches through these pages, each one individualized, many of them charming, some hilarious, a few irritating, and all of them vividly real. I could see parts of myself in every one of them, from the petulant Fred Vincey, to the blunt Mary Garth, to the frigid Mr. Casaubon, to the muddle-headed Mr. Brooke—almost Dickensian in his comic exaggeration—to every gossip, loony, miser, dissolute, profilage, and tender-heart—the list cannot be finished. Perhaps Eliot's most astounding feat is to combine the aesthetic, with the ethical, with the analytic, in such a way that you can no longer view them separately. Eliot's masterpiece charms as it preaches; it is both beautiful and wise; it pulls on the heart while engaging the head; and it is, in the words of Virgina Woolf, “one of the few English novels written for grown-up people.”"

49,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,Rating 5 out of 5,"I shelved this as a romance on a whim, but if I'm being perfectly honest, this is just a work of brilliant realism. :)George Eliot, nee Mary Anne Evans, was a fascinating woman who lived a life by her own ideals, living out of wedlock with a married man in Victoria's England, working for the Westminster Review and writing novels under a man's name. And for all that, she brings it out pretty swimmingly in what appears, at first glance, to be a heavily moral tale surrounding a very moral Dorothy who turns out to be an idealist of the first degree. Not idiotic in it, but always looking out for ways to make it work in a world that is quite as flawed as we all know it.You can guess how it might go. Decide everything on high ideals, let others walk all over you and grin and bear it because of your high ideals, get roped into truly atrocious circumstances where your lifestyle and your happiness is curtailed because you refuse to bend your high ideals... yeah. Well. That's a tragedy and pretty uplifting at the same time, assuming you, as a reader, can bear to sit through it. :) (Did it affect me? Yeah. It did.)But this isn't the whole story. It's just Dorothy's story and she remains a good person throughout it all. The rest of the tale is a whole village of characters, some of whom take front row seat during the tale, hopping from marriages to politics to deathbed wills to rumormongering, firesales on reputation, finance, and absurdity. This novel is pretty fantastic. It's just like our modern epic realist modern novels, dealing with almost every single important issue of the day while always remaining very grounded and it never becomes a spectacle.The thing is... it doesn't feel like Austen or the Bronte sisters or Dickens. It never comes close to Collins, either. It just feels comfortable with a very deft hand at personal philosophy and making the very best out of your life despite everything. Do not assume this has anything (much) to do with religiosity, for all that. She has plenty to say against the church, social conventions, and the idiocy of everyone, but it's not a satire. It's earnest, thoughtful, and really gorgeous. :)Am I a fan? Maybe a few minutes ago I wouldn't have said so, but as I wrote this review, being thoughtful about what I read, I suppose I am. :) "

51,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick,Rating 4 out of 5,"What happens after a happily-ever-after? Middlemarch begins where so many novels before it had ended: with the central couples pairing off and getting married. But we're made to see almost immediately that this romantic ideal – like everything else – is founded on misconception and hypocrisy, and that every ‘happily ever after’ must give way to a daily working-out of duties, compromises and quotidian battles.Eliot gives herself seven hundred pages to demonstrate this, and then to work her way back towards some kind of more plausible happy ending, one that will take into account these realities. Given how much accumulated understanding has built up by that point, it's hard not to see the book as not just well observed, but genuinely wise. Perhaps that's what Woolf meant with her famous pronouncement about this book being one of the few novels for grown-ups.Still, I can't pretend that reading it was always an enjoyable experience. The final two hundred pages have an incredible power, but you have to read through the first five or six hundred to get to them, and this sometimes calls for reserves of patience and application. While the plot has this extraordinary ambition, the prose itself is not, most of the time, something I relished for its own sake. Eliot's style is dense and, while it's not exactly humourless, the humour is buried under so much ironic formality that it can sometimes get suffocated.Sometimes she overwrites: we are told that one character, struggling to finish a book, rids himself of ‘that chilling ideal audience which crowded his laborious uncreative hours with the vaporous pressure of Tartarean shades,’ where Eliot manages to cram six adjectives around just four nouns. And occasionally clarity suffers – try this for a sentence that needs to be read at least a couple of times:But Mr Casaubon was now brooding over something through which the question of his health and life haunted his silence with a more harassing importunity even than through the autumnal unripeness of his authorship.A bit of dialogue comes as a welcome relief after a few pages of this kind of thing. Still, if you're someone who reads books mainly for character, which I'm not, then Middlemarch should be hugely appealing, since Eliot's characters must be among the most authentic and fully realised in literature. She captures them all with many deft, perfect descriptive flourishes: conventional Celia, ‘hardly more in need of salvation than a squirrel���, the scholarly Casaubon, ‘as genuine a character as any ruminant animal’, or pretty, idealistic Rosamond, ‘clever with that sort of cleverness which catches every tone except the humorous’.Eliot observes them all from an imperious distance, not allowing her sympathies to interfere in their downfall. Everyone has some great work or achievement they wish to accomplish; none of them accomplishes it. This process of disillusionment is ruthless and protracted but not gratuitous; the book is supremely unsentimental without being cruel. At times it brings to mind the trajectory of a Greek tragedy, except that here tragedy is not seen as the work of some quasi-supernatural ‘Fate’ or ‘Destiny’, but rather as the result of innumerable concrete human decisions, compromises, and illusions. Everyone is allowed (as Eliot says of Dorothea) ‘perfect liberty of misjudgment’ – which is a decent four-word summary of the book.We mortals, men and women, devour many a disappointment between breakfast and dinner-time; keep back the tears and look a little pale about the lips, and in answer to inquiries say, ‘Oh, nothing!’There is something fascinating about watching the slow, believable process of adjustment as people come to terms with these misjudgments, and accept that ‘life must be taken up on a lower stage of expectation, as it is by men who have lost their limbs’. Eliot herself lived for twenty-four years with a man who was in an open relationship with his wife, so she must have been well aware of the many strange practicalities of married existence. This is a big book, but there's a lot that's not here. When I compare it to all the novels of the late eighteenth century I've been reading over the last couple of years, which are concerned with the slave trade, human rights and international revolution, Middlemarch seems remarkably parochial in its concerns. Sex has also disappeared, or rather, to be more accurate, has been sublimated into Victorian social conventions: a kiss near the end of this book hits with something like the intensity of an orgy scene. But it's not something Eliot can address directly, which is a shame, because it must be an important factor in Dorothea and Casaubon's marriage.So real are these characters, and so intricate is the way their lives are interweaved, that despite my reservations I found myself completely overwhelmed by the climax. The extraordinary eighty-first chapter, where Dorothea goes to speak to Rosamond, had me in floods of tears – though little is really expressed. It simply depends on such a wealth of accumulated understanding and past history. The narrowness of the horizons becomes the whole point, and I was very moved by Eliot's conclusion thatthe growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.Here, at least, the beauty of the prose is equal to the ambition of the book."

I will admit that. It had always intimidated me. Large size and dense, winding prose will tend to do that to one.However. It did have some things to say. The problem, of course, is that most of the subject matter it tackles- marriages, love, children, the various problems of country life are things that people can read about in many forms, and they don't need to come to such a Serious book to do it. Especially one that adds in highly unnecessary tangents on the subjects of politics and industry written into whatever chapter Eliot happened to be working on at the time (or so it seemed). The light touch of Austen is just a hand wandering down a bookshelf away, after all. But I really must say, taking it for a book about just those things would definitely be missing a whole lot of the point. It's astoundingly accomplished and witty and her knowledge on a wide range of subjects is truly impressive.My issue with this book is that it can be quite dry, for all it's interesting ideas. And even with all it's intelligence and sharpness.... it's very hard to connect with or care about any of the characters. If you do, it's generally not the characters you're supposed to connect to, or not for the right reasons. I connected with the heroine, but only because some of her delusions happened to match up with my own in my teenage years. But that's superficial and doesn't matter. The only person I felt that I genuinely understood and wanted good things to happen to was Mary, and she didn't have anywhere near enough screen time, so that was irritating.Anyway, it's wonderful, it's just... quite a chore, and I can't give any more stars to a novel that was so difficult to get through."
53,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins,Rating 5 out of 5,"From the Intro...'The book that Virginia Woolf characterized as “one of the few English novels written for grown-up people” is also a book about how to be a grownup person—about how to bear one’s share of sorrow, failure, and loss, as well as to enjoy moments of hard-won happiness.Part of what it means to grow up is that a person undergoes a movement away from an immature self-involvement, into more sympathetic recognition of the differing internal experiences of others. Eliot hoped that her books would urge that process along.....A really great novel can work in this uncanny way upon us. It can give us the sense that we are being read by it— that we are being moved to new understandings of ourselves and greater empathy for those around us.""==========During the time period of this novel, 1829–32, Evangelicalism in England was still strong, but in the era in which Eliot published this masterpiece, 1871–72, it's influence had markedly begun to fade. This is reflected in a change in Eliot's own beliefs and in certain characters in this book, not only Dorothea, but Reverend Edward Casaubon and Will Ladislaw.By the mid-19th century in England, many who were raised in evangelical households, including Eliot (Mary Ann Evans), felt alienated. She would provide a strong voice articulating her generation’s frustration with the faith. Her doubts seemed to have begun early, in adolescence, and her view of her childhood, articulated years later, was not positive.“My childhood was full of deep sorrows,” Eliot wrote, “colic, whooping-cough, dread of ghosts, hell, Satan, and a Deity in the sky who was angry when I ate too much plumcake.”Eliot was a prodigious reader of philosophy, science, as well as European literature in five languages. Her knowledge of German enabled her to read and translate some German theological works that were far more critical of the historicity of the Bible than most British scholars or clerics would accept. She was also influenced by another work, Inquiry Concerning the Origin of Christianity, by Charles Hennell, which also challenged the historicity of the Bible. The consequences of the English ignorance of German scholarship shows up in Middlemarch. The idealistic Dorothea marries an older man, an Oxford rector, The Reverend Edward Casaubon. Casaubon has been laboring for years on a futile academic endeavor. Dorothea does not realize this, but soon learns how pedantic the research is and how reluctant her husband is to publish anything, even a journal essay based on his work.Dorothea meets a man her age, Will Ladislaw, who falls in love with her. He tells Dorothea: “If Mr. Casaubon read German, he would save himself a great deal of trouble.”The dialogue continues: ""I do not understand you,” said Dorothea, startled and anxious.   “I merely mean,” said Will, in an offhand way, “that the Germans have taken the lead in historical inquiries, and they laugh at results which are got by groping about in woods with a pocket-compass while they have made good roads. When I was with Mr. Casaubon I saw that he deafened himself in that direction: it was almost against his will that he read a Latin treatise written by a German.”Generally, because of such willful ignorance, Eliot had no respect for Evangelical clergy the likes of Casaubon. In an essay she describes them as…“Minds fettered by this doctrine no longer inquire concerning a proposition whether it is attested by sufficient evidence, but whether it accords with Scripture; they do not search for facts as such, but for facts that will bear out their doctrine. It is easy to see that this mental habit blunts not only the perception of truth, but the sense of truthfulness, and that the man whose faith drives him into fallacies treads close upon the precipice of falsehood.” (Evangelical Teaching)Eliot “came out” one Sunday in 1842 (her 23rd year) when she refused to accompany her father to church. Her pious parents threatened to disown her, but her siblings prevailed upon them to change their minds. After mid-19th century, the conservative English church had largely lost the younger generation to atheism, agnosticism, and aestheticism, even as the older believers passed away. The Church never recovered. Today, only 3.7% of the English people are evangelical. And the Church of England membership is half of that.Meanwhile, the late 19th century remnant of Evangelicalism in Victorian England became the birthplace of literalist Christian fundamentalism, including all the apocalyptic stuff with the rapture and all of that. It quickly hopped the pond to the U.S.--------------Middlemarch was released a volume at a time, 8 total, in 1871. The critics of the day were grumpy. They complained that the book was ""depressing"" and ""melancholic."" Some were displeased that it did not have a fairy tale ending like a Jane Austen novel. Because, you see, Dorothea was supposed to marry Dr. Lydgate, presumably so they could create a foundation to benefit global health or something. And, of course, her overbearing, judgmental evangelical father dismissed the book entirely.It seems that Virginia Woolf (quoted above) was rare in recognizing the brilliance of this realist novel. So no surprise it had to be ""re-discovered"" in the 20th century, some now ranking it as the greatest British novel.Instead of a fairy tale ending and the elusive achievement of ""greatness"" that few attain and that leaves untold people frustrated who don't achieve it, Eliot offers the realistic alternative of a good enough life that many more can obtain and can be happy with. Eliot expresses it in the final lines of the novel in reference to Dorothea...""But the effect of her [Dorothea] being on those around her was incalculably diffusive [i.e. spreading to others], for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on un-historic acts, and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life and rest in unvisited tombs."" ==============So what is this “Key to all Mythologies” that the Rev. Edward Casaubon devotes all his energies to in the Middlemarch story? The Key is meant to demonstrate the correlations and confluences that link “all mythologies” (all cultural belief systems and superstitions) to Christianity. In the novel, the Key is specifically portrayed as something that would unlock the mysteries of the ancient Greeks and Egyptians and simultaneously bind them to Christian theology. As mentioned above, George Eliot was a very learned and scholarly person and this shows in her complex novel. There was increasing awareness in the late 19th century, when her novel was published, that there were ancient myths that pre-dated Christianity that spoke of dying and rising gods, including in Greek and Egyptian mythology. The capacious record of this was published in the 12-volume “The Golden Bough” by James Frazer. Needless to say he was way ahead of Joseph Campbell. The knowledge of these myths in the time of George Eliot raised a very uncomfortable question for orthodox Christians re: the uniqueness of the death and resurrection of Jesus. Was it nothing more than just repackaging of an old story, or was it, as Casaubon hoped to prove, and C.S. Lewis later to argue, that the Gospel is a “true myth” foreshadowed by these other myths? Casaubon’s project is onerous and ultimately doomed, as is Lewis’ rationalization. ===========The influence of Cervantes on Eliot...Turning to his squire, the knight remarks:“Just tell me: don’t you see that knight riding toward us on his dappled grey horse, wearing a golden helmet on his head?”“What I can see,” answered Sancho, “is just a man on a donkey, a drab one like my own, who’s wearing on his head something that glitters.” “And that’s Mambrino’s helmet,” said Don Quixote. As if to announce that Middlemarch will continue Cervantes’s project, Eliot chooses the dialogue, quoted above, between Don Quixote and Sancho at their first sight of the barber as the epigraph to her novel’s second chapter—the episode in which the pious young Dorothea Brooke meets her future husband, Mr. Casaubon, for the first time. As Don Quixote sees the golden helmet of Mambrino beneath the surface appearance that Sancho sees as a barber’s basin, near-sighted Dorothea sees in the face of this aging scholar a “great soul,” with whom she could share “some spiritual communion.” Of course, her sister Celia, playing Sancho to Dorothea’s Don Quixote, sees only “a dried bookworm towards fifty” with a “sallow” complexion and “two white moles with hairs on them.”Unlike her namesake, the plucky Dorothea of Cervantes’s novel, who disguises herself as a boy to escape disgrace, then sets out to find her noble lover—Dorothea Brooke lives the sheltered life of a young Victorian heiress. Her passionate longing for “the completest knowledge” that would lead to “an ideal life” is mocked and thwarted at every turn by her family and friends. So, after her first glimpse of Mr. Casaubon, she transforms this provincial clergyman into “a living Bossuet [a seventeenth-century French theologian], whose work would reconcile complete knowledge with devoted piety; here was a modern Augustine [the fourth-century preeminent Church Father] who united the glories of doctor and saint.” Like Don Quixote, who configures reality through the chivalric romances he has read, Dorothea Brooke creates an imaginary husband out of the scraps of highest wisdom that she read at school. And, like Cervantes’s Dorothea, she too escapes—only Eliot’s delusional Dorothea thinks that she is escaping from the stifling pettiness of her life by embarking on a marriage that she imagines will be a heroic quest: “I should learn to see the truth,” she fantasizes, “by the same light as great men have seen it by.

54,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/529836-phil-williams,Rating 5 out of 5,"When I finished reading this book, I wrote in the front of it that 'This is the most rewarding book you will ever read' and left it on a bookshelf in Fiji, dreaming that someone would go through the effort of reading the whole thing based only on my comment. I doubt anyone's picked it up since then; Fiji is a strange and frightening place.I spake the truth, though. It strikes me that most of those who've read Middlemarch these days are hapless souls who resent it as the mammoth task some crooked professor set them at university. I read it for myself, unwittingly, and was pleasantly surprised. George Eliot conjures a massive spectrum of characters, and gets into the head of every major player in the novel. We are shown what motivates the most despicable figures as well as those we are drawn to, and as a result there is no one in this book who you cannot relate to in some way or another, or at the very least understand. In my opinion that is what makes it such a grand read: George Eliot understood people. She shows you that everyone thinks in their own way, and it makes it hard to judge anyone when you can observe this.Though it is that lasting impression of how we might perceive one another that really makes Middlemarch stand out, the story itself is continually interesting for its sheer breadth. George Eliot set out to give a panoramic view of a provincial town, and she achieves this incredibly. It is a long read, but every step in the story builds up to the picture of the whole. Sometimes I found myself confused as to how I'd ended up in a situation where I was reading what should essentially have amounted to little more a 19th Century soap opera, but what confused me was that I was enjoying it so much. I was desperate to know what would become of these marriages and debts and everything inbetween. This is such a detailed character study that you become genuinely interested in their lives, no matter how mundane the details might appear if you stepped back and really thought about it.Middlemarch is not a book for everyone, I imagine. The insight George Eliot shows might bore rather interest many. But it interests me like hell, so a pox on the naysayers."

George Eliot, pseudonimo di Mary Ann Evans [1819-1880] è l’autrice di questo magnifico romanzo (1872) che presenta le migliori qualità dei romanzi dell’ottocento e nessun difetto: la narrazione vola spedita, senza intralci di sorta, i caratteri e le inclinazioni di tutti i personaggi sono raccontati con puntiglio ma senza prolissità, le loro scelte, le loro azioni condivisibili o meno ma coerenti con la loro indole, il tutto condito da una scrittura dal taglio raffinato e impeccabile; in un’unica parola: un capolavoro!"

In the utmost brevity, if you have found the mere thought of reading Middlemarch too daunting because of its sheer length, it is time to cast the fear aside and take your copy down from the shelf and begin to read. Find yourself immersed in a world of saints and sinners in rural England of the 1830s. George Eliot's novel breathes of life on every page. Joy in it. Revel in it. Do not think of it as a book from which the dust of a distant past must be blown, that means nothing today. It will bring much to you if you simply open it and begin to read."

I found the story much more engaging and loved the ending, although I still agree with my fifteen-year-old judgement that the second half of the book is far superior to the first. Eliot's writing style is growing on me, and I love the characters and themes explored with Middlemarch, especially Fred and Mary. Dorothea and Ladislaw rather grew on my this time as well. "
58,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90786-lee-klein,Rating 5 out of 5,"In college, a respected English Lit professor (Pat Day) mentioned at one point that we like when it's about 65 degrees, not too cold, not too hot, and he associated this preference with Middlemarch, the literary embodiment of 65 degrees, which I didn't read in college because I didn't take 19th century fiction somehow, despite having majored in English Lit. About eight years after graduation, 20+ years ago, I first tried and failed Middlemarch -- got a decent paperback at Avenue Victor Hugo bookstore in Boston but didn't make it beyond the preface. Text was too small, hardly any margins. Never read that copy and donated it at one point. A few years ago got this lovely ""clothbound classics"" edition, read the first few pages, but didn't have it in me to continue at the time. Decided to try again this summer and felt like the text was just a little too small for me, so I downloaded a 99-cent Kindle ""Dover Thrift"" edition and read it on my iPad, with the text enlarged to a comfortable size. The page numbering made no sense (368 pages, but each ""page"" required three or four swipes to achieve a new number). I liked tapping archaic words I didn't quite know (""durance"") and seeing the definition pop-up immediately, and I highlighted in yellow hundreds of comely, graceful phrases, the first being ""vague labyrinthine extension,"" referring to Casaubon's consciousness but also seeming to have some metafictional content too. Early on, it interested me that Casaubon's project is called ""The Key to All Mythologies,"" the subtitle to Franzen's recent Crossroads, so it felt like reading Middlemarch would unlock an understanding of Franzen's project in a way I looked forward to -- and it turns out that for a grand-sounding, apparently grand-standing subtitle, it's actually self-deprecatory and humbled, knowing that Casaubon's project is incomplete, beyond his capabilities, and sort of DOA or at least outdated because he doesn't know German, the language in which all recent related research has been written in. So there's that intertextuality that kept me interested at first, as well as the image of Casaubon as a sort of leaden John Kerry-looking academic who attained dimensionality early on and helped bring the book to life. Also of course Dorothea and Rosamond, a pair of dissimilar lovely ladies that echoed in advance similar dissimilar pairs in War and Peace, Natasha and Helene. Also of course Tertius Lydgate and Will Ladislaw. And to a lesser extent Fred Vincy and Mary Garth. And all their parents and intermediaries, particularly Bulstrode, whose name suggested to me ""balustrade,"" an ornamental railing that to a degree connects or extends and supports the novel's primary columns. Loved generally the phrasal fabric of the novel, the language that elevates what otherwise often seemed if reduced to its plot points like a romance, ""unfortunate"" marriages, thwarted longing and love, difficulties with financial issues, petty local politics, long-concealed impurities of the past coming to light in the present. Loved also the chaotic intrusion of Raffles, who sort of reminded me of Barney from The Simpsons albeit in period dress. Beyond interest in its form and phrasing, I suppose I was interested in the presentation of the casual, nearly universal bigotry of the era, how the townspeople were aghast that Ladislaw's relative had been a Polish musician -- not even purely English! And someone, maybe Lydgate, had a Jewish ancestory, I think?! Sir James Chettam, Celia's husband, objects to Ladislaw on the grounds of not having good blood. ""Peerage"" is another word I learned in this -- as history, it suggests how far we've come but also the sort of classification and stratification that's always been a core feature of human idiocy. Such stratification does serve as an effective restraint in novels, the obstacles of propriety that the characters cannot overcome etc without sacrifice after hundreds of pages of handwringing until climatic scenes underscored by a serious weather event as though the atmosphere itself objects to their actions. Generally, though, after a point maybe two hundred pages in, once the primary players cohered, reading Middlemarch was all I really wanted to do, settling down on the porch after work in the afternoon or later in bed or on the weekends spending as much time as possible on my iPad. Downloaded the complete George Eliot, the complete Brontes (and purchased a lovely ""clothbound classics"" box set that should arrive today), plus North and South, and will now start filling the sizeable gap in my 19th-century reading knowledge."

61,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36408043-mihaella,Rating 5 out of 5,"My first day after ‘Middlemarch’ has started rather airily and confusedly, despite the tender light and dewy freshness of morning. I felt a bit void as if something lost or missing, even a vague but still tangible impression that I don’t feel happy – well, in this transient present. I am saddened and disappointed that my companionship is now ended – for me it felt too soon, notwithstanding it’s 992 pages. It took me 7 weeks to complete it (so it shows the GR schedule) – not because of the content, or any other of the book faults (which are non-existent in my opinion) – on the contrary, everything was there to make it a fast read, but as I felt so nicely involved into it, then it came just naturally that I should take as long a journey as it is but without any compulsory reading action. So, now how to avoid or surpass current disappointment? First strong impulse is to admit that for this year it’s been my favorite read. From the very start I have acquired a passionate interest in the book’s flow. And, every now and then, within the book’s read many reposes (the real time reserved for reading was too limited and very fragmented over the course of these 7 weeks), I loved to think how all these stories – because there happens to be many stories in it – have existed in the imagination of the writer before she has put it down in a written form, giving them all very diverse layers of colours in order to create the ultimate effect, that of a work belonging to a creative genius.This is a book that – indisputably – I loved wholly and with no reserve. I don’t even try to find any reason of fault with it. Except, of course, the short length ;) – which previously had been the chief hindrance why I have not read it, as I felt always demoralized when seeing the fatty tome, with small fonts and child palm fit pages.What I loved most was to try seeing the book’s pages through the writer’s eye – together with her constant soothing and comforting voice – tremendously attentive to the details of the actual creative labour – and, at the same time, keeping in view the idea which that labour was to fulfil. For the background relief – it’s been, personally, a melancholy journey also into my distant past, in the sense that I have remembered lots of the episodes I have spent at my maternal grandparents place, a village which is also a mark of my birthplace (well, actually my mother had time to reach the closest city by bus before I eventually said a final “I am coming‼…”). Life in a provincial town – well, in this case the village was not so small and it was just 20 min by bus from the closest town- has always seemed of a different milieu than what I have been accustomed to living in the city (I have been here almost all my time except the first 3 years of life). I know that my grandparents and all their proximity neighbours seemed to have had similar habits and behaviours as the neighbours from the Middlemarch. And, especially with same on-going surveillance on manners, gossips, changes that were affecting their routine life, struggles to show or pretend who is more respectable, who is doing more for the living community, what things need to be amended so that their current life be improved in the sense of living conditions, etc etc.Message-wise – well, in a short sentence I would say this is an image of what Life should be – that is to say, a continuous series of efforts directed to the production of a personally contemplated or imagined integrated whole. In this way, each and every one of the main characters in the book is trying to paint the picture of his/her life, recognizing that there should be a purpose in life, perfectly identified and definite. That can be summarized up: in the determination to make oneself rich and respectable, to choose a wife of a certain level, to raise and educate the children to the highest possible level, also by sending them to the University, to have entertainment activities – well, in line with the book’s time period, giving dinner parties, going to the balls (was there any ball actually, or I miss-match with another book?), going to the church, being a man/men of public spirit – devoting life to some project that can help society, to go every day to the library and read books, getting and giving lectures, travelling and, eventually, just the fixed idea that you have to travel and move on this earth and, if possible, in heaven, but still being in this life, here and now, on this planet.Conclusion-wise is to have a distinct purpose in life – and, if you’re among the fortunate enough, to make that kind of life that resemble a work of art, that is to say, to extract out of these purposes also that thing that can still exist after all is gone, something that can continue its existence beyond them. Eliot has a special way to emphasize this concept which would mean in simple words: to live for the good, the true, the beautiful. For my part, this novel is a great source of plentiful original ideas, as well as true ones, that ensure a delightful intellectual cultivation, by helping the mind to reach to that state of wonder and interest with which you might look on everything when it touches your inmost core. As life shows it, it is always hard to return to that state of purity and simplicity before our senses have been perverted, but still, it is so much worth while to be able to restore that state of wonder – doubtless of a different kind than that of a child, but more as of a result of wide experience and knowledge, and certainly some attained self-principles. Also, this is one of the very few novels I’ve read lately where I could enjoy tremendously a very refined, graceful, witty, judicious style of writing, as if someone – very much resembling the author - wrote what they saw, thought and felt with their own language, without any intention to prove a model for themselves.Some very good hours have passed since morning and now being affected differently from the strength and brilliancy of the mid afternoon sun, I realize this is not precisely what I had in mind to write, maybe just a little so. So, I think I better leave this open… For now, I feel like I would just lie on the grass gazing at the burning sun (today it’s really warm for a last day of September) with a look of intense yearning – which of course I won’t be able to sustain too long, mostly because I don’t have a grass around here…"
62,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24672869-nastya,Rating 3 out of 5,"A great historian, as he insisted on calling himself, who had the happiness to be dead a hundred and twenty years ago, and so to take his place among the colossi whose huge legs our living pettiness is observed to walk under, glories in his copious remarks and digressions as the least imitable part of his work, and especially in those initial chapters to the successive books of his history, where he seems to bring his armchair to the proscenium and chat with us in all the lusty ease of his fine English. But Fielding lived when the days were longer (for time, like money, is measured by our needs), when summer afternoons were spacious, and the clock ticked slowly in the winter evenings. We belated historians must not linger after his example; and if we did so, it is probable that our chat would be thin and eager, as if delivered from a campstool in a parrot-house. I at least have so much to do in unraveling certain human lots, and seeing how they were woven and interwoven, that all the light I can command must be concentrated on this particular web, and not dispersed over that tempting range of relevancies called the universe.Isn't it hilarious how every generation thinks back on the works of their predecessors? I keep chuckling because here I am, reading her leisurely prose with the omni-present narrator going on tangents and I am thinking this way about her work. It has to be be tongue in cheek, right? Her going on a tangent that pokes fun at writers going on a tangents.This book is so frustrating! There's a novel in it that I respect a lot, I appreciate Eliot's intelligence and her effort to write a realistic provincial town without crazy ghost roaming the moors or crazy women living in the attic. People tend to praise the character work and I just don't know. As far as I can see, we have a cluster of saintly characters, silly ones (Vincys) and three main dreamers. Yet I don't find Ladislaw being particularly well-written or have a personality, so the great sacrifice in the end rings extremely hollow. I was also surprised how little empathy Eliot had for Rosy. Rosy, who is a silly flighty person, whom we are supposed to compare to her foil, St Dorothea, and yet all the way I was thinking – but what about Fred? Why silly Fred gets to be reformed and helped over and over again, yet Rosamond is a life ruiner? Why Eliot has so little curiosity interrogating a young woman who lost her first child in an incident she was responsible for? If you will deny these people complexity and love as an author, then at least I prefer Austen's cutting scrutinizing through comedy. When I look through my friends' reviews of this book, I keep seeing the word ""masterpiece"" over and over, that makes me feel like I am missing something. I can't tell you how happy I was to encounter Henry James' contemporary review where he said: "" Middlemarch is a treasure-house of details, but it is an indifferent whole."" and ""Many of the discursive portions of Middlemarch are, as we may say, too clever by half. The author wishes to say too many things, and to say them too well"". My thought exactly! Eliot sacrifices the flow, simplicity and any emotional connection to the story. And then that downer epilogue, but that's realism for you I guess.I don't know, while I can respect Eliot, and even enjoy little parts here and there, yet I seem to be unable to love her writing. I guess I'll be in that corner with James for now. And I only hope that when I encounter another one of those gushing reviews calling this book a masterpiece, I’ll show restraint and faith in my own judgment and won’t rush into another reread."
63,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is the book that I would answer if I were hypothetically asked what book could have single-handedly become the reason that my relationship would ever fall apart. More so than Infinite Jest or Proust, other examples of books that have consumed or are consuming my life in one way or another. I didn't realize I had a reading problem until I realized that my boyfriend was unpacking around me; literally unpacking boxes right from under my feet - while I sat there and turned the pages. Or when I realized the house was suddenly quiet because he had taken the dogs out for a walk. He could have lit his face on fire and I'm not entirely sure I would have even noticed. Even while I was helping with the moving, or at work doing work-y types of things - I was usually thinking about Middlemarch. So, people in my daily life? The glazed look on my face, all of the, ""I'm sorry, what did you say""'s? It was because of this book. And there's not even a good reason for that.Infinite Jest is the kind of book that it seems okay to let the rest of your life fall apart around you as you read it. It seems appropriate to become one of those people while reading Infinite Jest. It lends itself to that sort of behavior. But George Eliot? Middlemarch? Pshaw! I would have said before I read it. Are you kidding me? Get a life, woman!But, dude. I totally became that person. Admitting there is a problem is the first step to seeking help. So I'm here. Seeking help.Just like Infinite Jest it's a book that could be re-read numerous times and you'd probably get something different out of it each time. That Eliot was a whip-smart woman, and I bemoan the fact that I just don't know enough about history at times to keep up with a brain like hers. The notes in the end were exceptionally helpful, though annoying at times when they pointed out chronological mistakes - like the characters couldn't possibly have known about a certain popular book yet because in the real world it hadn't been published yet during the time in which the story was to take place. Whoops! I don't need to know those sorts of things, but thanks anyway.If you don't like details about every little thing, you won't like this book. There's so much detail it makes the whaling chapters in Moby Dick sound almost appealing. (Never mind, I just got over it. Whew.) I can't imagine writing a book like this, just like I couldn't imagine David Foster Wallace writing a book like Infinite Jest. The amount of time, and energy - holy cats, the psychic energy that must have gone into putting down so much information that covered such a wide variety of topics - it makes me need a nap just to process it.Middlemarch - the 19th-century answer to Infinite Jest? Hmm.Highlight: Oh dear, I just found out that there was a 1994 TV version of the story - with Rufus Sewell. You know how most women are all ga-ga over Colin Firth and none of them can really explain why? I'm that way about Rufus Sewell.He's the dreamboat in the red coat. Just in case anyone thought I was all drooly-cup over the old guy."

Great English authors like Charles Dickens look seriously deficient when compared to George Eliot. The woman hidden beneath this masculine pseudonym managed to reach an unprecedented depth, realism and beauty of writing. Both her male and female characters are well-developed, true to life and diverse, and she seems to be equally well acquainted with the life of clergy, land-owning aristocracy, farmers, businessmen and scientists. And in addition to all this her writing is a treasure-trove of fascinating images. An amazing novel."

That in itself is a special gift. "
67,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,Rating 4 out of 5,"If I was to offer gratuitous advice to young people – and I guess I’m getting to an age where offering such advice seems almost mandatory – then it would be that just because everyone you know thinks that you are about to make a terrible mistake doesn’t automatically make them wrong and you right. There is a character in this who goes against the crowd twice in the novel – the first time she is dead wrong and the next time we are meant to feel that she is right. I guess, in the end, there is no advice to be gained. Sometimes going against the views of everyone you know is the right thing to do, sometimes it is the wrong thing to do – life’s a bit like that, really.I was enjoying this quite a lot and then got near the end and had to finish it in a rush – always a good sign with a novel. Although, to be honest, at the start I probably could have given up a few times and so if you are thinking of reading this I really must warn you that you probably will need to stick with it. The problem is that this is a book that really couldn’t have been written today and that might get in the way of your reading. I mean, many of the main characters are not introduced at all for a very long time. The first hundred odd pages of this are pretty much a single story – the story of the courtship of a young woman to a very old man (that is, a man about my age chasing after a woman a bit younger than my daughters, well, Yuck!). And that was fine – everything turned out as I had predicted, which is also often a good sign with novels, but then Ms George suddenly started talking about a completely different set of characters, seemingly completely unrelated to the people in the first hundred pages of the book. You know, you really can’t do things like that on your poor reader. I had one of those, “Who’s this now, where’s what’s-his-face gone?”I kept comparing this with Austen – and there are similarities, but in many ways this is a much more serious book than any I’ve read by Austen. It is probably closer to Persuasion than any of the others – and in part also comparable to Madame Bovary. There are some jokey characters in the book, but if the book has a problem it is perhaps that there are just too many terribly earnest characters wandering about. The female leads are all as beautiful as can be and their men are all loving and endlessly devoted, you know, ‘I may never be able to have the woman I love, but I will pine for her regardless, the best is behind – all ahead is nothing but memories. There is a sense in which this is all just too much and the romance is a bit overwrought. But still, I’m a bit of a sucker for a good romance and this is a particularly good one and like I said, I did need to pick up my pace towards the end. I mean, this book meets all of the necessary criteria for a good romance. Impossible barriers set in the way of true lovers, scandals, sordid intrigues, you know the kind of thing, near fatal misunderstandings. And all of this with a good dose of irony about the position of women in society and unconcealed revulsion at a world in which some have more than they can make use of and others have far too little.This is a book of pairings – a novel where the desire to ‘compare and contrast’ is uppermost in the mind of the reader. There are marriages you’d rather take your own life than to be trapped in and these are held up against marriages that are loving and kind and then even against others that are just bland and nothing. There are people who have all the show of goodness and none of the reality and vice versa. The problem with structuring the book in this way, as a kind of series of compare and contrasts, of the author virtually saying, ‘look, see, black and now, look at this one, white’ – is that the author also wants very much to show shades of grey, but the need for contrast calls for strong contrast and shades of grey are rarely strong enough for such contrasts. For example – the two wills. Both of them can be compared – they both aim to determine the course of the world after the death of their author (and all I can say is that this can never be a good idea). That they both finally fail to meet their original purpose matches George Eliot’s major theme in this book, I guess – which I take to be you need to play the cards you have been dealt and you need to play them as honourably as you possibly can. But these two wills are also compared with the shattering of the living ‘will’ of one of the characters that brings about the great fall in the book. Perhaps it isn’t the shades of grey that are the real problem here – I came away from the novel, although not exactly fond of Bulstrode, feeling at least I understood him and believing his actions. I know that probably doesn't make sense - but I'm trying to avoid spoilers.There is a nice aside story between Fred and Mary – Fred starts the book with expectations that might make him seem ‘above’ Mary, but he loves her best and can’t imagine a life without her. Then there is a change and Mary has the better expectations – but they are presented as the happy couple and proof that love conquers and redeems. All the same, the bits of the novel I found least convincing where the grey bits. That is, the bits where good characters go a bit bad or bad characters suddenly act well. The two characters where this least worked, I thought, were also married to each other – Lydgate and Rosamond. With Lydgate this hardly mattered to the story as a whole, but with Rosamond her least convincing moment had to sustain what was the most important scene in the novel, and this involves her acting completely out of character – this came close to spoiling the book for me. The person who recommended this book mentioned that they liked the fact George Eliot ‘talks to camera’ in the novel. Now, she only does it a couple of times and only fairly early on. I have thought about this a lot now. I’m not sure I like it. The problem is that it makes the author – and this book is already written in omniscient narration – a character in the book. But a character that we are not really allowed to ‘judge’ as we can with the other characters. The idea that she is passing judgement on the characters she has created seems a little too much for me, I think. I know authors do love to play God – but they should only be God the creator, not God the judge of our sins. If authors must judge they should do it only in the fit and proper punishments they make their characters suffer and respond to – that is telling enough. I’m not going to say ‘show, don’t tell’, because that would be a cliché, and I don’t like using clichés.A really good sign with a book like this is I come away really disliking some of the characters. Mr Casaubon, for example, even has George Eliot defending him as not as bad as he seems (part of the reason she shouldn’t have bothered talking to camera) – and perhaps we should have some sympathy for him given he does have the great discomfort of marrying someone infinitely better than him in virtually every way – morally, intellectually, and well as her being young and beautiful. Worse yet, he has to ‘be the man’ in the relationship, so that does tend to mean a lot of silences between them – as they say, sometimes silence is golden, sometimes it is plain yellow, in his case it is an object necessary. Here is a woman that loved to speak her mind who is trapped in a relationship with a man who cannot match her on any field and so therefore all he can reasonably do is demand her silence. Hell on earth for both concerned, I should think. But understanding his predicament didn’t make me like him any the better. And while we are on the subject of yucky characters, the character I disliked the most in the book was Rosamond – what a cow! But someone who is so beautifully self-centred that she is also immediately recognisable – we have all known Rosamond. I think she is probably one of the masterpieces of the novel. Marriage to her would test the patience of Job. She has married to a doctor, so I did keep thinking that if he couldn’t work out a way of poisoning her what hope is there for the rest of us? She was the character I was most pleased with being beautiful – she really did need to be beautiful. But I really don’t think either Mary or Dorothea needed to be raved about as much as they where. I know Mary isn’t ‘beautiful’ – but she also seems a bit ‘too good to be true’.I really enjoyed this book, although I think it would have worked better if the ‘other’ stories were introduced earlier and perhaps there was more of the old ‘and meanwhile…’ All the same, there are very few miracles in the text – people lived out their lives and not everyone gets either what they want or deserve (although there is quite enough of both for me to still call the book a romance). The scene with the thunder storm towards the end – no sex, but the next best thing, I guess – is the sort of thing I mean by romance. But it would have been much more clichéd if it had happened earlier in the novel or in reference to virtually any of the other marriages – look, the book is a classic for a very good reason. "

I never thought that I’d find an author that could make me think of Charles Dickens as a man of few words but, in MIDDLEMARCH, George Eliot achieved it … and some! There is no question that the decision to read what is often touted as one of the greatest novels in English literature is also a decision to challenge some of the most labyrinthine, bewildering, abstruse, meandering, and often directionless grammatical constructions that any author ever decided to commit to paper.Why say, for example, that Will Ladislaw is lazy when you can say, ""Doubtless; but I fear that my young relative Will Ladislaw is chiefly determined in his aversion to these callings by a dislike to steady application, and to that kind of acquirement which is needful instrumentally, but is not charming or immediately inviting to self indulgent taste. I have insisted to him on what Aristotle has stated with admirable brevity, that for the achievement of any work regarded as an end there must be a prior exercise of many energies or acquired facilities of a secondary order, demanding patience.""?The speaker and Ms Eliot clearly have a different notion of what constitutes ""admirable brevity"" than I do!That said, your commitment will be rewarded as long as you also reach the decision to read past what, on the surface, appears to be little more than an extended soap opera that makes mock of the lifestyle of 19th century small-town (and apparently, for the most part, small-minded and parochial) British gentry. As Eliot unfolds the often bitter story of her lengthy cast of characters, the list of issues that underlay the development of their lives is as lengthy as the book itself – misogyny, patriarchy, feminism and women’s right to self-determination; reactionary social antipathy to the evolution of modern medicine and the administration of hospitals; the nature of marriage, inheritance law, bankruptcy law; the trials and protocols of Victorian romance and courtship; and political reform and the construction of railways across England.There are at least four major sub-plots which weave at length in and out of each other and pass in and out of the limelight of the story-telling. But suffice it to say that they all can be summarized under the major heading of “a portrait of Victorian gentry life in a 19th century fictional town in central England”. I’m glad I read it but I have to admit that I’m also glad that I finished it. Recommended but tighten your belt before you start. You’re in for a very long ride!Paul Weiss"

Se centra en todos los ámbitos que envuelven al pueblecito ficticio de Middlemarch, no sólo en la psicología de los personajes sinó en la política del lugar, sus conflictos sociales, las vidas cotidianas después del matrimonio, etc. Es realmente complejo. Una vez acabada la historia y viendo el cuadro completo me alegro de haberlo leído y creo que hasta lo valoro más y que me ha dejado poso, pero no puedo decir que fuese para mi una lectura ligera ni que tuviese siempre ganas de ponerme a leerlo.Las reflexiones finales me hicieron mejorar mi visión global de la historia, y me quedo con el último párrafo: más que los grandes hechos históricos son las vidas y luchas anónimas las que muchas veces llevan adelante el progreso social."

However, with a comparable event to the denouement of the latter novel occurring after a mere 50 pages in this one, it was clear that the heroes and heroines of this book were going to pass through many heavens and hells. Eliot's writing is of the kind that values depth in the inspection of any element, whether it be an event, person, conversation, action, sentence, glance, or slight tremor of the lip. Her characters are incredibly real, and I could see various parts of myself in so many of the characters that you can only appreciate what a keen observer of homo sapiens she was. At the same time, there is enough humour present that you feel safe that you are not listening to a preacher with a pen, but a relatable voice from a retrograde age, who could conceivably be cheeky enough to conclude a serious story with a common joke.The multi-layered web of human relationships develops, strengthens, lacerates and shines in different gradations of light and shadow with each page and chapter, and towards the end of the reading over three weeks, I was left with a pleasant sense of the book being one of those that highlights and gently prods us to reflect on both our follies; the time we waste, the base thoughts we have, the weaknesses we occasionally run to; as well as the opposite, that of our natural compassion, reticent intelligence and conscious understanding of others' daily toils.In the same vein, the main impression I had from early on in this novel was the great equaliser at work in this universe, that when one meets fortune, you are apt to expect misfortune; and a misfortune only continues until a fortune comes rolling along. To the inhabitants of the town, who could easily be you or me, all of us who are, on average, walking along the path carved at the midline between our most joyous nights and gloomiest days.

L'analisi che la Evans conduce e il ritratto di questa piccola cittadina di provincia non hanno nulla da invidiare al Naturalismo del ben più famoso Zola. Tre storie d'amore e i rapporti che intrecciano con gli altri (numerosi) personaggi, offrono il destro all'autrice per tratteggiare minuziosamente caratteri e limiti di una società profondamente patriarcale, moralista, irregimentata secondo i dettami protestanti, ma anche di tracciare l'inizio d'un fecondo clima di cambiamento che nella volontà di riforma e nello spiccare di caratteri più liberi, vede il preludio a un cauto Liberalismo."

Dorothea Brooke, thirsting for knowledge and a meaningful occupation, deludes herself that she would gain those things by marrying Casaubon, a cold, obsessive scholar more than twice her age. Casaubon himself is mired in self-delusion about his life-long research, which Dorothea soon finds out to be obsolete. The idealistic Lydgate deludes himself that by marrying the pretty but high-maintenance Rosamond Vincy he would gain both beauty and love, without having to give up the ideals that he lives for. Rosamond's delusion is that by marrying Lydgate, whose fledgling medical profession she despises, but whose aristocratic connections she covets, she would gain status while being maintained at the high standards that she has gotten used to. Bulstrode, MIddlemarch's banker and pious benefactor, has successfully deluded the whole town of his decidedly unpious past before it came back with a vengeance in the form of a certain Mr. Raffles. Mr. Brooke, who champions the liberal spirit of the Reform Act, is under the delusion that by merely being idealistic, he has changed the world, while neglecting to reform his own estate. The main interest of the novel consists of seeing how these very human characters cope with the consequences of their delusions. Dorothea soon realizes that Casaubon and his work are not what she thought they were, but she holds up her end of the bargain by being a loyal spouse to him, though her heart sinks when she imagines the loveless and futile years that stretch out before her. Casaubon's sudden death mercifully terminates the disastrous marriage, and Dorothea's integrity, after further trials and tribulations, is ultimately rewarded by her finding love with Will Ladislaw. Lydgate discovers how his love of a pretty face slowly compromises his ideals and ends up in mediocrity, very far from what he aims for as a young medical reformer. Rosamond selfishly persists in her delusions without any regard for what it costs her husband. She finally gets what she wants, but at what price? Bulstrode's past misdeeds eventually catch up with him and destroy the life that he has so painstakingly constructed in Middlemarch. Mr. Brooke's political dilletantism never change the world, but it successfully opens up a path to meaningful occupation for an otherwise aimless young man.Meanwhile, all of these characters' struggles are contrasted with the Garths' earthy integrity. Mr. Garth is an estate manager who does his job capably and honorably, without any pretensions to status or unearned wealth. Fred Vincy and Mary Garth are the only couple that is not under any delusions of each other's characters and goes on to a long and happy union.Eliot's writing is infused with penetrating insights into human nature without ever losing compassion and understanding for their frailties and errors, a quality that she shares with Tolstoy. She never sentimentalizes her characters, except perhaps for the idealized Garths. They are all believably human, and they drive the narrative instead of the other way around. Eliot also has a great eye for the ludicruous and her wicked sense of humor constantly enlivens what could have been a ponderous account of provincial English life. One may read Middlemarch for the portrait of a Midlands town on the cusp of industrial revolution in 19th century England, which Eliot admirably delivers, but ultimately it is Eliot's insight into the universal human condition that makes it eternally relevant.Finally, this book is a profoundly wise, if rather melancholic, reflection on the loss of youthful hopes and ambitions, and their replacement by the more realistic (and inevitable) compromises of maturity. Which, Eliot says, is not a bad thing in itself, as "" the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs"".

Wilde να δώσει μια πρώτη απάντηση: ""Τα πάντα έχουν σημασία στην τέχνη, εκτός από το θέμα"". Όσο όμως κι αν τα αποφθέγματα είναι ενδιαφέροντα, ιδίως εφόσον τεχνηέντως έχει εμφιλοχωρήσει κάποια αυθεντία ως επιχείρημα, δεν αρκούν. Συνεχίζω…Δεν διαβάζω το Middlemarch για να μάθω ποιες είναι οι σχέσεις εξουσίας, σε κοινωνικό, ταξικό, φυλετικό, οικογενειακό, προσωπικό επίπεδο την εποχή της Eliot. Δεν αντιλέγω πως κάθε έργο εκτυλίσσεται σε ένα συγκεκριμένο χρονικό πλαίσιο, του οποίου λειτουργεί συχνά ως καθρέφτης, εμπεριέχοντας εντός του θραύσματα αυτής, εν μέρει ή εν όλω. Αλήθεια, όμως, τι μπορεί να προσφέρει μια υπόθεση που εξαντλείται, εν τάχει, στο ποιος θα παντρευτεί ποιον, στο πώς κάποιοι εκνευριστικά προνομιούχοι αριστοκράτες θα διατηρήσουν τα προνόμιά τους, δίχως να χάσουν κάτι από το κύρος τους ερχόμενοι σε επαφή με ""κατώτερους"" ανθρώπους, ενώ ταυτόχρονα καταπιέζουν και καταπιέζονται σε βαθμό ευνουχισμού, όντες έρμαια των απωθημένων τους παθών; Εφόσον επιθυμούσα να μάθω περισσότερα για τη Βικτωριανή εποχή (ή όποια άλλη), θα ήταν προτιμότερο να αναζητήσω απαντήσεις σε κάποιο από τα πάμπολλα ιστορικά έργα με σχετικό αντικείμενο. Δεν υπάρχει χρεία ανάγνωσης 1050 πυκνογραμμένων σελίδων για το σκοπό αυτόν. Δεν υπάρχει λόγος, επίσης, να διαβάσω το Middlemarch για την ""κοινωνική του κριτική"" στα Βικτωριανά ήθη (τα οπισθόφυλλα των περισσότερων βιβλίων χρησιμοποιούν ανερυθρίαστα την κριτική μιας εποχής ή συστήματος ως κράχτη). Η απελπισμένη (και απελπιστικά φτηνή) ανάγκη αιτιολόγησης/ωφελιμότητας της ανάγνωσης, αποτελεί διαχρονική ""πληγή"" που έχει δυναστεύσει την τέχνη από καταβολής της. Συγκεκριμένα, η ανάγκη αποκόμισης κάποιου οφέλους, κάποιου νοήματος, κάποιου διδάγματος, η οποία προκύπτει από την ενοχική αμφισβήτηση της απόλαυσης που δεν απορρέει και δεν συνδέεται άμεσα με κάποιον κοινωνικά αποδεκτό σκοπό. Και έρχομαι στην ουσία του επιχειρήματός μου: Δεν χρειάζεται να διαβάσω λογοτεχνία για όποιον ""σοβαρό"" εξωγενή και αλλότριο σκοπό. Εξηγούμαι: Η λογοτεχνία είναι ατομική υπόθεση και δεν (πρέπει να) έχει άλλο στόχο πλην της προσωπικής απόλαυσης. Η λογοτεχνία σε όποια μορφή (εύληπτη, δυσνόητη δεν έχει σημασία) δεν ενέχει τέλος (σκοπό), δεν αποσκοπεί στην κοινωνική αλλαγή, δεν στοχεύει στο να φτιάξει ""έναν καλύτερο κόσμο"" και τα τοιαύτα, διότι τότε εκπίπτει στον διδακτισμό, αυτοκαταργούμενη ως έννοια και ουσία. Η τέχνη ΔΕΝ είναι η ζωή (το αντίστροφο μπορεί σπανίως να ισχύσει)! Η τέχνη ""αρδεύεται"" από τους παραποτάμους της πραγματικότητας, από το ίζημα και τον αφρό της, ώστε να μεταστοιχειώσει τα στοιχεία αυτά σε μια ποιοτικά διαφορετική ολότητα. Η τέχνη είναι μια μεταγλώσσα που απλά χρησιμοποιεί τους κανόνες (και αυτό όχι πάντα) της επικοινωνίας για τους απόλυτα και ""αυτιστικά"" δικούς της λόγους. Αν θέλει να είναι τέχνη και όχι διαφημιστικό φυλλάδιο ή -χειρότερα- πολιτικό μανιφέστο για ενοχικούς ζηλωτές που αναζητούν τη χρησιμότητα σε κάθε ανθρώπινη εκδήλωση. Η τέχνη, τέλος, δεν έχει ουδεμία ηθική διάσταση (γι' αυτό και σώζει ψυχές), υποχρέωση ή δέσμευση, πλην εκείνης μεταξύ του συγγραφέα και του αναγνώστη. Μπορεί, παρεμπιπτόντως, κάτω από ειδικές περιστάσεις, να λειτουργήσει ως καθρέφτης, φέρνοντάς μας σε επαφή και αναδεικνύοντας ασυνείδητες πτυχές του εγώ μας, μέσα από την –εξίσου σπάνια κι αυτή- σύνδεση με τον συγγραφέα και το έργο του. Γιατί να ζητήσει κάποιος οτιδήποτε περισσότερο; Διαβάζω το Middlemarch, για να επανέλθω, διότι προσφέρει υψηλή αναγνωστική απόλαυση. Διότι στις σελίδες του η Eliot χρησιμοποιεί την αφηγηματική της τέχνη για να εισχωρήσει εις βάθος στην ψυχοσύνθεση των ηρώων της, ενδοσκοπώντας, αναλύοντας κίνητρα, σχολιάζοντας ανθρώπους και καταστάσεις με τρόπο απαράμιλλο. Διαβάζω το Middlemarch, όντας εχθρός του λογοτεχνικού σχετικισμού (του ""ό,τι μου αρέσει είναι καλό!"", λες και το γούστο δεν διαμορφώνεται επίπονα και σταδιακά μέσω της παιδείας, αλλά είναι αυτοφυές), διότι είναι ένα κείμενο κλασικό με την εξής έννοια: Αυτό που θα αποκομίσει ο σύγχρονος αναγνώστης από πλευράς αφηγηματικής απόλαυσης (και όχι νοήματος, γνώσης κ.ο.κ.) παραμένει αυτούσιο σε σχέση με την εποχή που γράφτηκε. Γιατί; Διότι, κατά βάση, η ανθρώπινη κατάσταση (τα πάθη, οι φόβοι, οι επιθυμίες, οι ματαιώσεις) παραμένει αναλλοίωτη και ο μεγάλος Συγγραφέας ""υπερχειλίζει"" τα όποια χρονικά ""φράγματα"" φύλου, τάξης, θρησκείας, έθνους, συνομιλώντας με τον αείποτε Άνθρωπο. Όταν αφαιρέσεις τη ""φλούδα'"" της εποχής, παραμένει ολόδροσο και μεθυστικό το άρωμα του λόγου. Δεν ισχυρίζομαι πως η ανάγνωση του Middlemarch είναι περίπατος ""εν αιθρία"", καθότι απαιτεί έναν εν γρηγόρση αναγνώστη, περιπαθή, ευεπίφορο στην απόλαυση που βασίζεται στην αργή και μεθοδική ανάγνωση, στον στοχασμό και στην επίγευση του λόγου, της φράσης που κλωθογυρίζει στο μυαλό, ακόμα και μετά το πέρας της παραγράφου, αναγκάζοντάς τον συχνά να επανέλθει, διακόπτοντας τη ροή της υπόθεσης προς χάριν της κατανόησης. Εφόσον, βέβαια, κάποιος επείγεται να ολοκληρώσει ώστε να προχωρήσει στο επόμενο ανάγνωσμα, έχοντας δεσμευτεί στο challenge των 50, 80, 100 βιβλίων του Good Reads, μάλλον θα απογοητευτεί από τον χρόνο που θα απαιτήσει αυτό το βιβλίο. Αν όμως αποφασίσει να του αφιερωθεί ως να είναι το πρώτο και ίσως το τελευταίο της χρονιάς, θα έχει κατακτήσει έναν πολύ πιο ουσιαστικό στόχο και μια ψυχαγωγία (αγωγή της ψυχής) καθαρτήρια. "

Plot, people, society, egos, fears, doubts. You name it; she got it right. Middlemarch follows a handful of people through life; individually, societally and within the context, limits and pressures of the times they live in. What Eliot shows is that both inside (personal) pressures and outside (society, the times, experiences) shape a person into what they become. Change one; you change the person. Each of us is bound by the times we live in and those we come into contact with. It's also about personal courage to take charge of one's life. Courage to face one's ideals, one's faults, one's surroundings, the pressure of the times and not bend to it if not desired. It's also about consequences of not facing these circumstances with courage to lead the life one wishes to lead (or the goal one wishes to work towards). These words can't tell how genious Eliot is at stating so much about life, it's worth, personal goals and our ability to achieve (or not) our destinies. "

Maybe what got me out of the story were the countless protagonists: they were so many that it was quite tricky to follow especially at the beginning. I didn't really like any of the main characters and most of their storyline, although there's no denying that Eliot talent at characterization and analysis of the human condition is impressive. Great execution but the story didn't really work for me."

As it is, the quickest of us walk about well wadded with stupidity.”Middlemarch certainly is a great classic, but I found that, in the end, it lacked the certain something I need to find to be able to say this is one of those classics, the ones which get their hooks in your heart and never let go. While one can't help being awed by how wide-ranging, far-reaching it is in its scope, I was disappointed with the effect, or lack thereof, its characters had on me. I could try to explain myself with a stream of words, as many as I can come up with, but the truth is that the truth of my relationship with this book is disappointingly simple: it didn't make me feel a thing. I appreciated it in a cerebral way, but my feelings were left untouched. The want of any emotional response on my part is all the more frustrating in that each and every character is allowed plenty of space for their characterization, which should have made it easier for me to connect with them, and instead, on me, failed miserably. Personally, I believe, or so it felt to me, that George Eliot's approach to everything is so strikingly cerebral (once again I use this word because it's the one that best conveys my meaning) that the pregnancy of her discourse overshadows our response to it. I am not sure that Middlemarch was a pleasant read for me, and for that I can only be sad, but it was also a reading experience I couldn't possibly afford to miss out on."
81,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42294189-roger-brunyate,Rating 5 out of 5,"Happy Endings Don't Come EasilyVirgina Woolf famously said that Middlemarch is ""one of the few English novels written for grown-up people."" Surely one of the things that led her to this assessment is that Eliot saw beyond the usual mechanisms of her 19th-century predecessors. Neither the happy marriages which seem to be the end-all in Jane Austen, nor the plot contrivances that manage at the last moment to break some impasse in Dickens, are of much interest to her. She has them, of course, but the story never stops there. Happy endings don't come easily in Eliot, and grown-up people know not to expect them in real life either.A little over a third of the way into the novel, with Chapters 33–35, come a series of scenes concerning the death of a rich character and the reading of his will. They reminded me of how important to Victorian novels are wills and inheritance generally; for characters of a class who seldom work for their living, inherited wealth plays a very important part. But the majority of characters in Middlemarch do have to work; it is Eliot's strength to recognize the fact. The chapters about the will struck me more because of the comparative absence of the inheritance motive during the previous 300 pages. True, there is one young character who, preferring to lead the life of a sporting gentleman, manages to live beyond his means on the expectation of coming into property, and the will-reading comes just in time to help him out of a tight spot. But Eliot denies him this easy solution. Instead, the young man, Fred Vincy, is forced to think again about his responsibilities; by the time he achieves his goals 500 pages later, he is a changed character who has earned his happiness and the respect of the woman he loves.It turns out, in fact, that the old man, Mr. Featherstone, had drawn up not one but two wills. Lying on his deathbed, he tries to get Mary Garth, his young housekeeper, to help him burn one. But she refuses, both out of a general sense of propriety and more particularly because she loves Fred Vincy (though fully aware of his faults) and it would put her in a questionable position to do anything to affect his prospects one way or the other. Such a finely tuned moral sense is not unique to Mary, though it gives her a particular beauty despite her plain appearance. Time and again, characters in this novel make difficult decisions, often to their own disadvantage, simply because they are right. I cannot think of another Victorian novel so suffused with moral goodness, especially when the exercise of that goodness seldom leads to immediate happiness.======
Marriage, which has been the bourne of so many narratives, is still a great beginning, as it was to Adam and Eve, who kept their honeymoon in Eden but had their first little one among the thorns and thistles of the wilderness. It is still the beginning of the home epic—the gradual conquest or irremediable loss of that complete union which makes the advancing years a climax and age the harvest of sweet memories in common.
This is the second paragraph of Eliot's ""Finale."" She has arranged two marriages, and salvaged another that for a while had seemed in doubt. This his her way of saying that ""Reader, I married him"" is not necessarily the end of the story; her brief epilogue will look forward three or four decades and tell us what became of her main characters. But I am most struck by the fact that her explanation is really not necessary at all. For she has already shown at least two cases where the ""irremediable loss of that complete union"" seemed a real possibility. Her heroine, Dorothea Brooke, wanting to do something useful in her life, rejects the eligible Sir James Chettam to marry and assist a man old enough to be her father, the scholar Edward Casaubon, only to find that his projected magnum opus, ""A Key to All Mythologies,"" is as desiccated as he is. Their marriage comes in the first of the eight books that made up the original edition. In the fourth book, the progressive young doctor Tertius Lydgate marries the beautiful but vapid Rosamond Vincy. These are two cases of good people making bad choices, and the results of their choices will pursue them for the rest of the novel. I remember being impressed by the frank way that Thackeray treats marriage in Vanity Fair, (1847) and Hardy does something similar in 
Far from the Madding Crowd
 (1874), but neither author devotes so much time to the aftermath of marriage as George Eliot did in 1872. Perhaps because Mary Ann Evans (the novelist's real name) was in a far from conventional relationship herself, living with a man who was nominally married to someone else.This was my third attempt at reading the book. The first time, I gave up somewhere in the middle of the first volume. I could see Dorothea heading into an emotional cul-de-sac with Casaubon, and could not bear continuing with it for 700 pages more. The second time, I believe I got into the section where Eliot begins to introduce the other main characters, such as Lydgate and the Vincys. But Dorothea is such an unusual, strong, and deeply drawn creation that for a long time all the others (even the impressive Lydgate) pale by comparison. It takes the better part of 200 pages for the other strands of the plot to gather an equivalent momentum—but when they do, there is no stopping them. This is partly because the characters themselves deepen and evolve as the book goes on; unlike Dickens, there are very few even secondary figures who are the same people at the end as they were at the beginning. And it is partly because the novel gets more and more copious, as Eliot casts her net wider and wider still, eventually taking in just about every aspect of English life in the 1830's.Eliot called it ""A Study of Provincial Life,"" and it is just that. Not provincial in the sense that you get with Jane Austen or the Brontes, as life led at a slower tempo, away from the excitements of London. But provincial in the sense that it takes in the life of an entire town, plus several neighboring villages, as a teeming tide-pool in which all classes of society are represented. Middlemarch is amazing because of its capacity, because of its variousness. Lydgate is not the only doctor in town, there are six or seven of them. Casaubon is not the only clergyman; there is a particularly fine clerical gallery, including the bachelor Camden Farebrother, a particularly delightful character who is secretly in love with Mary Garth, yet helps Fred Vincy to win her. There is a thriving community of merchants, publicans, gossips, and men about town. And the range of subject matter is equally extensive: chapters on the history of medicine, the coming of the railways, the conduct of elections, and the 1832 Reform Bill are merely a few that come to mind.======Dorothea Brooke. For all its variousness, Middlemarch remains her book. Strong, earnest, compassionate, apparently beautiful, and ultimately wise, she has no female equal in the novel except perhaps for the modest Mary Garth. Unfortunately, she has few equals among the menfolk either. Her marriage to Edward Casaubon was a mistake, but her long-unconfessed attraction to Casaubon's young relative, the dilettante writer and painter Will Ladislaw, does not quite answer either. Like all the major characters, Will grows over the course of the novel, but then so does Dorothy, and I fear he never quite catches up. Her relatives look down on him because he is not her social equal; I am left slightly unsatisfied because he is not quite her moral one. Few people could be.
One morning, some weeks after her arrival at Lowick, Dorothea—but why always Dorothea? Was her point of view the only possible one with regard to this marriage? I protest against all our interest, all our effort at understanding being given to the young skins that look blooming in spite of trouble; for these too will get faded and with know the older and more eating griefs which we are helping to neglect.
So begins Chapter 29. George Eliot, in one of her occasional first-person incursions, suddenly switches the point of view from Dorothea to Casaubon himself. And she treats him favorably. He is no less pedantic and domineering, but we begin to understand his insecurity, which comes from fear; dare I say we even begin to sympathize? Eliot maintains Dorothea's stature as her heroine by the tactic of not allowing her eminence to go unchallenged. And she is even prepared to laugh at her. Knowing that there is a danger that she might be seen as a prig, Eliot very gently laughs at her, as in this remark near the beginning of the book:
Riding was an indulgence which she allowed herself in spite of conscientious qualms; she felt that she enjoyed it in a pagan, sensuous way, and always looked forward to renouncing it.
Or this one near its end:
What was there to be done in the village? Oh dear! Nothing. Everybody was well and had flannel; nobody's pig had died; and it was Saturday morning, when there was a general scrubbing of floors and doorstones, and when it was useless to go into the school.
I have a habit of using postcards to keep my place in a book, and have built up a large collection. But selecting one for Middlemarch was particularly hard, as most Victorian pictures seem vapid by comparison (look at the dreadful illustrations that accompany the Wikipedia article). Except perhaps the one above, A Lady in Grey, painted by the Scottish artist Sir Daniel Macnee in 1859. It has been my companion now for two weeks. The modesty, the charm, the seriousness, that is certainly Dorothea. And yet, is she not perhaps a little too compliant, too domestic? Perhaps what I really needed was a portrait of Eliot herself? Is her secret that, in describing Dorothea, she was looking, honestly but not uncritically, into a mirror?======I read this in the Penguin Classics deluxe edition. It is easy on the eye, as comfortable in the hand as an 800-page tome could possibly be, and has short but stimulating introduction by Rebecca Mead, author of the best-selling memoir My Life in Middlemarch. But it has no notes—and Middlemarch is a book that absolutely needs annotating. On the other hand, neither of the other editions I consulted (the Barnes & Noble and the earlier Penguin) has more than the briefest notes; one phrase I looked up, ""He is like the fine old Crichley portraits before the idiots came in,"" remains as obscure now as ever—and it is far from the only one.But that's a quibble. Is Middlemarch, as others have claimed, the single greatest Victorian novel? The nearest competitor I can think of is Dickens' Bleak House. A strong challenger and perhaps Eliot's equal in range. But I feel that in moral outlook, in the evolution of its characters, and—thank you, Ms. Woolf!—in maturity, Middlemarch is second to none."
82,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,Rating 4 out of 5,"With Middlemarch George Eliot certainly has given us a unique study of life in a fictional English provincial town, around 1830. That was a period in which England was in full evolution: industrialization had already started but had not yet fully pervaded daily life (in this novel the first train track is just being built); the bourgeoisie already was predominant in politics, but still pushed for a further extension of the right to vote (the Reform Act) while imposing its values of decency and meritocracy on all of society; and it was also a time when science and technical ingenuity became tangible (in this novel mainly through the new approach to medicine). All these changes provoked opposition and debate and that controversial aspect is constantly addressed in the novel, in other words it gives it a realistic character. In that respect, Eliot approaches the near-contemporaries Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy.But Eliot distinguishes herself from them by the ingenious composition of her novel, with circular movements around several main characters, each of which is very beautifully drawn psychologically. The protagonists each go through a whole evolution, which takes them from ambition, stubbornness and self-overestimation to despair, bitterness, and modesty. That is a striking difference with, for example, a Jane Austen or a Charles Dickens: the characters that Eliot presents almost all are failing people, who constantly make wrong assessments. For example, they choose the wrong marriage partner and, above all, expect far too much from marriage; they are too ambitious and, without realizing it, they make lots of enemies; or they treat other people rude and unscrupulously until they are confronted with a situation that is hopeless for themselves. For me, this is the central key that Eliot gave to read this book: perception and judgment are everything, both when it comes to others and yourself, and bitter reality mercilessly punishes all mistakes in this difficult process. With that, this novel even shifts a bit in the direction of naturalism.This rather harsh theme is both sharpened and softened by Eliot's very own use of humour. She constantly uses the weapon of irony to either draw her characters or highlight certain situations. That irony, which sometimes balances on the edge of sarcasm, bears witness to a daring attitude, especially in the time in which she lived.This is also where the gender aspect comes in view. The female characters play the main role in this novel and quite frankly are the most interesting ones. Eliot constantly highlights how they are forced to play second fiddle and regularly are put in place by their husbands. But it is not a one-sided picture, for Eliot underlines with the same ease how the female characters entangle themselves and their environment through misjudgements and self-righteousness, and the men aren’t faring any better.It had been a while since I had read a Victorian novel, and especially at the beginning, I struggled to get into the story. In my opinion, that was mainly due to Eliot's style. She combines a very sophisticated vocabulary in long, winding sentences, with pointed remarks or witty characterizations; it's a combination that sometimes creates a demanding read. In particular, the constantly uttering of general wisdoms about human behaviour, often with an ironic and even sarcastic undertone, became a bit much to me in the long run. It is to Eliot's credit that she had very unconventional views in many areas, but in my opinion, she emphasizes them just a little too much in this novel, tending to the didactic and pedantic. And the few times she speaks directly to the reader and muses on how she will develop her story, show her too much as the master wizard. And that brings me to Eliot’s central theme of the man-woman relationship, and especially marriage. Eliot painfully portrays the catastrophe of two failed marriages, but in the end offers a much more positive perspective, with a relationship (a new marriage, of course) that is more based on equality and complementarity, although it certainly is not how we see that in our time. This outcome was a bit too predictable to my taste, and the way Eliot works towards this denouement in the final chapters, triggered my ""over-the-edge romantics""-alarm. The story line of two people at first drifting away from each other due to structural obstacles, the growing yearning followed by a series of misunderstandings, only to fall into each other's arms at the end, well, it was well written but it no longer works, I'm afraid, at least with me. And let's be honest, it's a very cerebral kind of passion Eliot cultivates: in this novel that is all about marriage, there is not a word about sex, there hardly is an exchange of a modest kiss. Apparantly, Victorian prudery is one convention she couldn't or wouldn't break with.In short, this is certainly one of the great novels of the 19th century, for me on par with the best of Austen and Dickens. I enjoyed the character drawing and was certainly carried away by the plot. But the slightly too mannerist style, the all-knowing narrative point of view, and the predictable romantic ending, spoiled a bit of my reading pleasure. So, well, 3.5 stars."
83,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6753400-gabrielle,Rating 3 out of 5,"I will not attempt to summarize “Middlemarch”, because not unlike “Les Misérables” or “War and Peace”, it’s a tapestry of a novel, with too many intersecting plotlines to recap here. Besides, the nitty-gritty of the plot is not what truly matters with this book, or should I say what truly held my interest. I was fascinated with its realism, honesty about human behavior and carefully constructed (main) characters.I was pleasantly surprised by how easy to read “Middlemarch” was, and no, I am not kidding! As classics go, the prose is fluid, something that drives the plot forward happens in every chapter and while it was long, I never felt that it dragged on needlessly. The real problem for me was that it was a bit too scattered: I understand that the idea is to give you a panoramic view of the small town and all its inhabitants and their various eccentricities, but this has more character plotlines to keep up with than “Downton Abbey”! I eventually lost track of which cousin was related to Mr. Featherstone and how; it got to be a bit distracting. I also feel like the book could have used a few historical notes (perhaps it is just my edition that lacks this feature) to give the reader a better grasp of the historical and political context the story is set in; I might be nerdy, by the Whig party is not something I knew the first thing about when I picked up this novel.Reading about Dorothea’s (obviously) doomed marriage made me so glad I didn’t live in 1830. It’s interesting how some books romanticize the past and this one just made me incredibly grateful that I had the luxury of getting to know my husband before we got hitched. Poor, dumb Dorothea! I get it: I like grouchy intellectuals too, but Mr. Casaubon is just horrid: not only does he not give a care to his wife’s happiness, but he also goes through a lot of trouble to make sure she can never live the life she wants. I found him incredibly cruel and heartless. And silly Rosamond and Dr. Lydgate are not much better off, as neither of them even thinks of having a sensible conversation about expectations and basic income management before falling all over each other.So 3 and a half stars, rounded down because I can’t see myself re-reading this one any time soon – mostly because I didn’t get especially attached to any of the characters. They are very well fleshed out and realistic portraits of flawed human beings doing the best they can, but there's just a little something missing... I only feel inclined to revisit books of that scope when there is a truly wonderful character, and this book simply doesn’t have a Jean Valjean to lure me back."
84,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12933866-edward,Rating 3 out of 5,"Despite George Eliot's insight into the human condition, her adroitness at creating entire, breathing characters, and her talent for description, there's simply no avoiding the fact that Middlemarch is an incredibly dull novel. Yes, Middlemarch is a wonderful and subtle account of the realities of middle-class life (what struck me in particular was its mature handling of the subject of unhappiness, not as a dramatic device, but as an earnest exploration of often overlooked human realities, so uncommon for its time period), yet the reality of this novel is page after page of overdrawn descriptions and inconsequential dialogue, all directed towards bringing to life the Reform era, a period I did not find of much interest either politically or in terms of its societal attributes. The problem rests mostly with me: I simply can't stand this level of sustained, pure realism. It's just not what I enjoy about literature, whose power lies in its ability to transcend the mundane, not simply to put it into words. I'm a patient reader, and I live for the occasional moments of transcendence that interrupt the inevitable tedium of very long books. One may equally criticise other novels, such as Moby-Dick, War and Peace, The Brothers Karamazov, Don Quixote and Les Misérables for their length, but I feel each of these contains something singular and fundamentally important about the human condition, such that one would be lessened in some small measure by not having read them. I do not feel this way about Middlemarch. What is so tediously revealed here is not rare, but is captured elsewhere in fiction - if not more effectively, then at least far more concisely. "

Viene de perlas pues es lo que Eliot nos brinda en su obra, donde se aleja del costumbrismo y se centra en ser un ensayo o estudio de la vida en provincias, una retahíla de información intrascendente que nos ofrece sin compasión.Me enfrento a mi mayor decepción del año con pena y culpables. Muchas veces olvidamos el papel que tenemos en esta red social, aquella en la que podemos hablar libremente de nuestras lecturas (o así debería de ser). Sin duda generamos expectativas, sean buenas o malas pero plantamos una pequeña semilla que condiciona la manera en la que empezamos las lecturas.Obviamente la predisposición no es la misma si todas las opiniones que lees son positivas (que pueden serlo, aquí no se está juzgando el gusto literario) pero si además le sumamos que venden la novela como algo que no es: salseante, a la que no le sobra ni una frase y que se lee en un suspiro… comienzan los problemas. La densidad que encontramos es innegable, guste más o menos, pero no disfracemos la realidad. Ojalá haber leído esta reseña antes de disponerme a leerlo, seguramente iría mucho más preparada y con las ideas claras de lo que me iba a encontrar.En cuanto a «Middlemarch» solo puedo decir que en su comienzo mis sensaciones no podían ser más positivas, la admiración hacia la narrativa tan inteligente y exquisita de la autora iba construyendo un camino en el que se avecinaba una relación duradera y satisfactoria. Pero llegó la desesperación, a partir de las escasas cien páginas la obra se pierde entre pasajes eternos y densos. Salen a relucir temas que no aportan nada a la trama y que nos muestran la verdadera naturaleza de la obra.La estructura de la narración no se sostiene, la autora se esfuerza en demostrar con orgullosa altanería su potencial narrativo (que no puedo discutir), le sobran unas 700 páginas (sí, en 200 podría desarrollarse lo trascendental) y encima nos regala un final de lo más precipitado pues durante más de la mitad del libro se olvida de sus personajes principales e intenta recuperar el tiempo perdido a toda prisa.En definitiva, la sensación que me ha embargado es el hastío y la rabia que se ha ido magnificando con el paso del tiempo. Me he aburrido hasta la saciedad esperando que llegara el inexistente salseo. Y no, no ha llegado en ningún momento porque este no es un libro salseante, ni entretenido, ni ningún calificativo similar. Y de ahí proviene mi decepción: me siento engañada. Mary Ann, no es culpa tuya, es mía por dejarme llevar por otras opiniones. Te volveré a leer, esta vez sí, conociéndote y sabiendo que no será fácil."

And second, unlike Jane Austen or Emily Brontë, there just isn't the same name recognition. I know George Eliot was a woman. That's about it. And finally, my Goodreads friends just seemed less enthusiastic. But then I read this amazing review. And it states: ""It's a book...about people who shouldn't have gotten married and did. About people who should have gotten married and didn't. About people who married the right person, and people who married the wrong person.""And honestly, I can't describe it better. Those lines put me in the perfect mindset for tackling Middlemarch. And much to my surprise, it didn't take much effort. I loved it.It is not a super exciting story. The characters are all loosely connected and don't necessarily live in Middlemarch. But their lives and vanities impact one another. It is a character study about motivation with a satisfying ending (I was particularly worried about that point.) And I'm not sure there is really much more to say. It was a lovely audio book. It made me smile. It made me sad and want to shout for the WRONGNESS we bring into our lives. It made me care. And it gave me more insight into the human character.

90,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2482609-captain-sir-roddy-r-n-ret,Rating 5 out of 5,"I have just finished reading Middlemarch, and this pretty much completes my reading of George Eliot's major works. Middlemarch truly is quite the sublime novel from start to finish. At first blush one has this sense of simply being immersed in a rather quiet and pastoral story, but there's really very much more going on here as one turns the pages.It is a story of rural England during the period of great reforms in politics, religion, agriculture, manufacturing, medicine, and even transportation. Mostly though, it is the story of human beings, and what it means to be human.Eliot gives us a wonderful cast of characters in Middlemarch, and they cut across all class lines from the landed gentry, tradesmen and women, and the simple country rustics that work the land and work in the manor houses. While perhaps Dickensian in cast, the peoples that populate the novel are not laden with the satire or comedy of a Dickens or Thackeray novel. No, these are all people that we can relate to even in this modern age. These are your neighbors, some rich, some poor; these are your physicians; your pastors; your shopkeepers, and so forth. The people of Middlemarch are your family, friends, and acquaintances and become even more so as the novel moves along.As much as I truly enjoyed the plots in Eliot's Adam Bede, The Mill on the Floss, and Silas Marner, I'd have to say that Eliot ""kicked it up a notch"" in Middlemarch. This is a stately, sedate, sophisticated, and complexly elegant novel. It really does demand the reader's full dedication and attention as it is read too, much like I found when I read her last novel Daniel Deronda. Boy, is it worth the extra effort, and one can't help but find oneself savoring the pacing and structure of the novel as Eliot lays out the tale.Eliot herself compares one of her primary characters, Dorothea Brooke, to St. Theresa de Avila. She is a genuinely decent human being who very much cares for the welfare of all of those around her, including even the man she marries early in the novel--Edward Casaubon. Interestingly, at least to me, that through the novel there was an almost tidal 'ebb and flow' of how the reader viewed many of the characters. The one exception was Dorothea, as she always stayed above the fray and maintains her 'saintliness'. I suppose that some could say that maybe Dorothea's saintliness was laid on a bit thick, but I think the character of Dorothea and her actions are important in helping to bring home the novel's overall message and moral impact. I think that this was also true in different degrees with some of the other characters, such as Tertius Lydgate, Rev. Farebrother, Caleb Garth, his wife, and their daughter Mary Garth. Perhaps the most powerful aspect of the novel though is Eliot's ability to make her readers empathize and even sympathize with the characters that are not so likeable, e.g., Bulstrode or Casaubon.Finally, I have to again say that somehow I really think that George Eliot had to have been some sort of inspiration for, or influence upon, the later works of Thomas Hardy. I really do see a somewhat similar approach to realism and naturalism in the works of these two important authors. While Eliot's novels don't showcase the impact of Fate or Chance perhaps as prominently as Hardy, they both inject a big dose of reality in the day-to-day lives of their characters. Bad things do happen to good and bad people alike, just like Life. The beauty of Middlemarch is that it depicts the indomitable Human spirit at its finest (and, dare I say, at its worst at times too). Those who wish to do good can; and for those who don't, well they get caught out.Great book! I highly recommend reading this novel. I have to be honest and fess up that I tried to read this book off and on for 20+ years, and it just never took with me. I was finally able to sink my teeth (and brain) into it and just let myself become immersed in the peoples and landscape of Middlemarch, and what a profoundly satisfying and enriching experience it has been. In all reality, I think that I am at a point in my reading and comprehension these days that I was finally ready for what Virginia Woolf described as ""one of the few English novels written for grown-up people."" I do look forward to re-reading it again at some point and thinking about the messages and lessons of this rich novel that George Eliot has crafted and left us."

Reading as a group read always seems to spur me to dig a little deeper, and read with a more analytical eye. I invariably benefit from the comments and insight of my group members, and this also enriches my own reading experience. *** SPOILERS AHEAD ***Although she focuses on a handful of major characters, Eliot manages to introduce us to the atmosphere of a small English town. The people of Middlemarch are like people everywhere--their actions range from caring and generous to judgmental and mean-spirited. All classes are examined. Dorothea and Celia Brooks both marry wealthy men of large property, with Celia becoming Lady Chettam. Dr. Lydgate has high connections, but must work for a living and marries Rosamond, who was raised as though she had high connections but whose father also works for a living. Then we have the Garths--a loving, cheerful family who are rich in everything but money. Caleb works for the local landowners, while his daughter Mary works as a servant for a wealthy miser. This does not stop Fred, Rosamond's brother, from falling in love with her. Some angst is felt by Fred's mother at this unequal match on Fred's part, but the heart wants what it wants. We follow the difficulties and changes in fortunes experienced by Dorothea, Lydgate, and Mary throughout the course of the book.I found the main characters to be likable, if exasperating in their choices, at times. Dorothea's starry-eyed idealism leads her into an unhappy marriage with a much older man that turns out to be mercifully short. Lydgate also makes a disastrous choice in his life partner, marrying the decorative and refined, but extremely spoiled and self-centered Rosamond. I found the most interesting study in the book to be that of Rosamond and her brother, Fred. Both are raised by indulgent parents; both are raised to really only think of themselves. When Rosamond faces challenges in her life, when confronted with adult situations that require her to look outside of herself and think of someone else, she is unable to do it. Her selfishness is monstrous--she is incapable of even thinking about how another person may be feeling, or their perspective of the situation. Fred, on the other hand, when faced with the consequences of his actions on others, is stricken with remorse. Consequently, he grows as a character, learning to adapt himself to situations, seeing things from the perspective of others, while his sister remains stagnant, mired in self-pity, the eternal victim. One of the members of the group read I participated in mentioned how well-suited Dorothea and Lydgate would have been as a couple, and I have been unable to forget that. How marvelously they would have worked together; how their individual hungers to serve their fellow-man would have complemented each other! I know that Dorothea and Will fell in love and were happy, but I never saw in him the burning desire to serve others that possessed her--and Lydgate. Oh, well, maybe someone will write a fanfic where Dorothea and Lydgate end up together!The prose is richly textured, with too many quotable lines to record. I felt involved in the characters' lives, invested in their problems and decisions, to the point of satisfaction when Rosamond finally gets somewhat of a comeuppance. It doesn't transform her--she is who she is--but it does set her back on her heels a bit. That's better than nothing! If you're looking for a book of great prose and insight into the human condition, you've found it."
93,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu,Rating 3 out of 5,"Midway through Middlemarch I was fully through with Middlemarch.Perhaps I've read too many Austen, Gaskell and other books of this genre and era for my own good, because I saw every plot turn, twist and device coming from a country mile away, and I got bored of it pretty quickly. I did not need the multitude of examples Eliot gave for each character's failings or whatever trait she might have been trying to illuminate. While useful to the plot to an extent, the excess wasn't necessary. It only served to tire this reader. Circumstance, circumstance, circumetcetera…I might add happenstance to that, as chance came into play almost too much. But then again, any time a writer relies on chance encounters is one time too many for me. Regardless, back to my main point: This is a story of circumstance. Eliot has laid out various characters on different social strata and painstakingly described their circumstances. The foundation is laid on a grand scale, but if we reviewed the blueprints we'd see the plan calls for nothing more than a modest house. (Double and triple checked to make sure I didn't write ""mouse"".) Surely, this house will overflow with drama, nearly overwrought drama on occasion, and seem to require a veritable castle to contain it, but nonetheless this vast foundation is a waste for all the big huffing nothing it all turns out to be. And what is this ""I think"" business, Eliot? Are you not the omniscient narrator? Do you not know what your characters are thinking? Most of the time you are all-knowing, but then suddenly for no reason it seems that you are shut out of their thoughts and left to conjecture and guesses as to your own creations' feelings. As a writer's device I see no point to this occasional hand-tying of the narrator.The bottom line is that Middlemarch was a perfectly okay read. However, boredom set in and I got nitpicky about details that others probably didn't notice or care about, especially if they were enjoying the read. For me, the best I can say for it is that it felt like something an Austen/Dickens lovechild would've written, and that ain't bad. "

A história, embora um pouco lenta no início, tem todas as características que esperamos encontrar num bom enredo vitoriano, aliás o subtítulo é bem explicito: “ Um estudo da vida provinciana”. E é isso que encontramos; uma vila fictícia na província, e um leque de moradores bem típicos dos meios pequenos onde todos metem o nariz na vida alheia e distribuem generosamente opiniões que não lhes foram solicitadas. Com uma moralidade a preceito com a época, o “corte e tesoura” é abundante e não menos maléfico. O “estudo” abrange todos os temas que envolvem a comunidade e as personagens fazem parte de cada um dos ramos: política, religião, ciência, artes, agricultura, ensino, medicina e as mil e uma atividades que dinamizam a vida social e económica da população, promovem disputas partidárias e instigam intrigas. George Eliot não perdoa a mentalidade comezinha nem as ambições desmedidas, põe tudo a nu com ironia e boa disposição. Assim como, em contrapartida, criou uma personagem memorável na pessoa de Dorothea Brooke, o livro abre com ela e fecha com ela. A Conclusão é um texto de homenagem e de grande realismo. Esta não é uma história de final “casaram e viveram felizes para sempre”. Esta é uma história em que casaram e viveram felizes nuns dias e chateados noutros, em que pessoas falharam e desiludiram, em que houve morte prematura, e tudo o mais que acontece na vida real fora dos romances. Apesar da narrativa exigente que pode levar muitos à desistência no início do livro, nas últimas 250/300 páginas o ritmo e o desenvolvimento compensam qualquer bocejo impaciente anterior."

97,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/162084-sherwood-smith,No Rating,"The occasion of this recent reread was a discussion of the book. At the end one of the groups said, ""Why is this considered a classic?""The question took me by surprise. I don't know why, since I've been asking myself that very same question about many of the so-called greats on various lists. But in my own perception, Middlemarch truly is a great novel, for its last paragraph--last line--alone. There is no better ending in any book I have ever read.But first we have to get there, eh?On this rereading, it occurred to me that that ending caps a novel that demonstrates among many other things the heroism of kindness.At the very beginning, the Prelude cautions the reader about women who seek greatness in a man's world, and how tragic and ineffective their lives often are. And yet the book that follows is not a lugubrious tragedy. In fact, in this reading I noticed just how much humor veins this polysemous work, not the least of which is conveyed through the trenchant irony of the narrative voice as ardent young Dorothea Brooke propels herself into a disastrous marriage while all her friends and neighbors look on, appalled.Some of the funniest scenes in the book occur in the company of middle-aged Mrs. Cadwallader, whose sharp eyed observations about the varieties of human experience are usually spot on. She gives Dorothea's marriage to the dry, scholarly Mr. Casaubon a year before it heads for shipwreck. Celia, Dorothea's younger sister, had until that time looked up to Dorothea, but afterwards she has lost her respect for her sister; in this reading it became clear to me that Celia has a better sense of what marriage is actually about than poor Dorothea, with her high-minded determination to subordinate herself dutifully to her husband's superior mind.In short, Dorothea discovers that her husband's mind is not superior at all, and at the same time her husband discovers there is more vexation then bliss in being married to a beautiful young lady of intelligence and integrity, because she actually expects to be a wife instead of a dutiful, occasionally glimpsed private secretary.This marriage is contrasted with the courtship and marriage of Tertius Lydgate--a forward-looking doctor--and Rosamond Vincy. These two do everything right according to the fashionable rules of society, but while managing to never understand the other in the slightest. Rosamond’s gently insidious narcissism is profoundly unsettling, the more because it is entirely believable. Who among us has not met at least one Rosamond?Whereas Dorothea finally wakes up to all the possibilities of love, when it looks like it is too late to do anything about it, in meeting Casaubon’s volatile, idealistic young cousin Will Ladislaw. And in a stunning moment, takes the reins. All along the narrative voice tells us what everyone says and does, though sometime prefacing remarks by “I think.” So it has to have been a stunning moment to Victorian audiences when Dorothea and Ladislaw kiss, and the narrative voice cannot tell us who made the first move. In other words, she could have! This was a really big deal during a time when the fashion was for fainting, passive, tiny-footed heroines.It is not just young marriages we get a look at. We also find ourselves involved in middle-aged marriages, and with middle-aged people who would like to marry, or had once been. But to say that this book, unlike George Eliot's friend Mrs. Gaskell equally brilliant book Wives and Daughters, is confined to courtship and marriage would be to ignore half the book. It is also about a society in transition, and the laws of society are made by men, though women make many of the rules. Though it is set in 1830, when medical reform was just beginning, it is surprising how much of a parallel exists today. . . .for since professional practice chiefly consisted in giving a great many drugs, the public inferred that it might be better off with more drugs still, if they could be got cheaply, and hence swallowed large cubic measures of physic prescribed by unscrupulous ignorance . . .To a certain extent, that sums up a problem of modern medicine, as envisioned by the mighty pharmaceuticals buzz.The various strata of medical knowledge, ignorance, and myth provides both humor and harrowing tragedy. Then there are the political issues, which are easy enough to draw parallels to today. What we find in this novel are men of affairs in conflict, their characters complex, their motives a mix. After asking why this book is considered a classic, the discussion group member added, “Would it be considered a classic if it had been written by a man?”Well, shoving aside the fact that most of the old list of classics were written by men, pretty much ignoring women’s contributions, the implication that this book might be included on the list because it was written by a woman (tokenism) I think is wrong. I think if anything it is on the list in spite of having been written by a woman.Though there are many great male-authored novels of the period, I find for the most part that the female characters they create are stock, if not one-dimensional. Most of Dickens’ heroines are pathetically passive, suffering virginally as they wait for the hero to be awarded them at the end of his labors. Thackeray does better women, but they tend toward caricature. Trollope also does better than Dickens, but his women tend to be skewed because of his particular hobby horses.But in Middlemarch, we get men and women who have equal agency in personal dynamics, even if women cannot work as physicians, or run for office. What the women do and think matters as much as what the men do and think.Is it a perfect novel? I don't know that there is any such thing. This one was remarkably innovative for its time, though it was set, as so many were, forty years in the past. One has only to read the reviews as the serial came out to find out what an effect it had on its audience, many of whom did not know that a woman's hand gripped the pen.It was written serially, which meant the early chapters were already in print when she wrote the end; though for the most part Eliot admirably avoids the coincidences and fateful-hand plottings of many of her peers, the entire third act turns on a coincidence, and I strongly suspect that had she time, she might have done a great deal of trimming, especially in the middle and latter third, to vast effect. That said, because the narrator can see into all hearts and minds equally, we get a close look at the costs of social deflections, religious sophistry, political maneuvering, and personal failures. And yet it is not a novel of darkness. The observations of human complexity resonate enough with real experience enough to underscore to breathtaking effect the consequences of choices made out of faith, integrity, and kindness. Choices that can change the entire courses of lives, though the moment of decision is made in quietude, and the acting on it is not hailed by the multitudes.In short, it is a wise, compassionate, sometimes funny and sometimes harrowing look at the range of human affairs, leaving us on a note of hope, with the conviction that life as it could be is actually possible for us all. One decision at a time."

Y es que no es una lectura fácil, en especial en sus primeros veinte capítulos más o menos; es una novela que exige mucho al lector: exige concentración, disposición y paciencia, pero superada esa barrera, merece mucho la pena seguir leyendo. La cantidad de personajes y sus parentescos es abrumadora en principio (y el libro no incluye árbol genealógico para situarnos); las familias de Middlemarch son extensas y están entrelazadas de forma un poco confusa de primeras, pero se le acaba cogiendo el hilo y se pilla casi en seguida quién es quién. Y sigues leyendo, y sigues y sigues y te das cuenta de que estás ante un novelón, ante algo muy grande que te va a dejar un poso tremendo. Y así es.Middlemarch es muchas cosas. Es una novela melancólica, irónica, pausada, costumbrista a más no poder, con un aroma austenita indiscutible y, también, con toques de novela histórica. George Eliot nos sitúa alrededor de 1830 y nos enseña una Inglaterra de provincias donde todos los avances llegaban más tarde y la gente era más reacia a ellos (como por ejemplo la ampliación de las líneas de ferrocarril), en una época en la que el país sufrió importantes cambios políticos y sociales, así como avances en la investigación médica y científica, no siempre bien aceptados entre nuestros queridos personajes, arraigados de manera muy profunda a sus tradiciones. Los numerosos personajes, todos muy diferentes entre sí, genialmente desarrollados e inolvidables, son el hilo conductor para mostrar todas estas cosas y, también, cómo era la vida cotidiana, las costumbres, la vida privada, los matrimonios y el paso del tiempo en las Midlands hacia el segundo tercio del siglo XIX. Muchos de estos personajes me cayeron un poco mal al principio, pero no pude evitar cogerles cariño conforme avanzaba la lectura, y es que todos sufren una evolución brutal a lo largo de la novela (y además han estado conmigo cerca de dos meses). No sabría elegir un solo personaje como favorito o destacable, pues es una novela tan coral y tan bien escrita que todos brillan.Confieso que empecé esta novela más sufriendo que disfrutando, pero me forcé a seguir porque sabía que algo bueno tenía que tener, y llegué a punto en que no podía ya parar de leer. La recomiendo sin duda, pero con precaución, para el momento adecuado. Hay que conectar con ella y tenerle paciencia, pero merece mucho la pena."

101,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4695-daniel,Rating 5 out of 5,"How does one review ""Middlemarch?"" Is doing so different than reviewing life itself? Both are a succession of births, deaths, marriages, debts accrued, debts paid, careers made, careers finished, love affairs begun, love affairs ended, love affairs left unconsummated, dreams fulfilled, dreams destroyed, and dreams deferred. As in life, many of the people encountered in ""Middlemarch"" are unlikable, and even the ones who are likable have myriad flaws. ""Middlemarch"" is very long and parts are kind of boring, but the overall achievement is staggering -- kind of like life itself.Virginia Woolf called George Eliot's book ""one of the few English novels written for grown-up people."" As such, ""Middlemarch"" is incredibly realistic -- almost aggressively so. Nothing happens in ""Middlemarch"" that wouldn't happen in the real world. This is not Dumas, for better or worse. Swordplay, revenge plots, high-level political intrigue, and murder are all absent. (Well, there might be a bit of murder; that's open to interpretation.) In their place we get what we get in our own lives: gossip, grudges, low-level political posturing, and death from illness and old age.My description may make ""Middlemarch"" sound dreary; it's anything but. George Eliot's writing is so sharp -- so biting, so sardonic, so wise in the ways of the world -- that even the slowest parts of her book are intriguing. The following is just a small sample of Eliot's wit from near the book's end (spoiler alert, I guess, though the book's 135 years old, so I don't know that spoiler alerts are still needed at this point): All who have cared for Fred Vincy and Mary Garth will like to know that these two made no such failure, but achieved a solid mutual happiness. Fred surprised his neighbors in various ways. He became rather distinguished in his side of the county as a theoretic and practical farmer, and produced a work on the ""Cultivation of Green Crops and the Economy of Cattle-Feeding"" which won him high congratulations at agricultural meetings. In Middlemarch admiration was more reserved: most persons there were inclined to believe that the merit of Fred's authorship was due to his wife, since they had never expected Fred Vincy to write on turnips and mangel-wurzel. But when Mary wrote a little book for her boys, called ""Stories of Great Men, taken from Plutarch,"" and had it printed and published by Gripp & Co., Middlemarch, every one in the town was willing to give the credit of this work to Fred, observing that he had been to the University, ""where the ancients were studied,"" and might have been a clergyman if he had chosen. In this way it was made clear that Middlemarch had never been deceived, and that there was no need to praise anybody for writing a book, since it was always done by somebody else.I toyed with giving ""Middlemarch"" four stars because of its tendency to drag at times, particularly in its middle third. But, no, fuck that. It's a brilliant book. Five stars."
102,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7664274-sarah,Rating 4 out of 5,"I don't think it has ever taken me so long to finish a book. I'm an instant gratification addict and Middlemarch is a novel that requires hours of slow investment and intense concentration. While reading, I found myself closing the book, laying it gingerly just out of view, and reaching for the remote control. For shame, Sarah! So, in a way, reading Middlemarch became a kind of rehabilitation for my current lifestyle. I used it to try build up my long suffering skills of focus and patience , I used it to wean myself off reaching for my smartphone every five minutes. Reading long novels is like finding yourself with a new adoptive family. When you spend weeks with the same characters, you become so invested in their lives, so used to their mannerisms that when you turn the last page, it's like losing friends. Middlemarch is a slow burning epic about marriage. From Dorothea to Celia to Rosamond, the lives of the strong willed and strongly flawed women of Middlemarch were defined through their marriages and their life choices. The men were just as varied - from Fred to Tertius, Will and Edward Casaubon, all had their own dreams and failures, and all were resolute in their views of how their women should behave. George Eliot is often considered a literary genius. I would agree. Her word puppetry makes her imense cast of characters leap off the page, her wit made me often laugh out loud. She was bold, a feminist and ,most surprisingly to me, an atheist. Quite early on in reading Middlemarch, I was suddenly struck by how little religious moralising there was. In classic novels of that period, religious values and morality is often forced upon the reader. Middlemarch still talked widely about religion - it's impossible to talk about the times without the religion that so tightly controlled the era - but with an interesting sort of respectful apathy. I immediately went off to read up about Eliot and what I found out about her character made me admire her immensely. To be an atheist at that time was to run the risk of social exclusion, and being labelled a heretic. Go Georgie - I LOVE me some strong women!I am glad I read Middlemarch. Would I read it again? ...I don't know. I don't think I would? It's a frustrating feeling - to have loved a book, but also to feel a huge sense of relief that I actually made it out alive."

It's about 800 pages (Eliot was such a prolific writer!), but differently from ""Daniel Deronda"" that was very verbose, here the prose is light and brilliant and there's not to struggle to finish it. Middlemarch is the name of a town and the novel narrates the story of its inhabitants and more precisely the story is focused on three couples: Dorothea and Will, Rosamond and Tertius, Mary and Fred. Dorothea marries at the beginning of the book Mr Casaubon, many years her senior, because he is a scholar and she wants to devote her life to help him, but their marriage will not be an easy one.Will is Mr Casaubon's younger cousin and at first he lives by the generosity of his relative, but he will soon decide to find his own way and he will develop an admiration for Dorothea.Rosamond and Fred are siblings and both spoilt by their mother. Rosamond has got great ambitions to marry an aristocrat and so she focus her attentions on a young doctor just arrived in Middlemarch: Tertius Lydgate, who is not seen well by many people.Fred instead is idle and in trouble with some gambling debts, wishing to inheriting something by the death of an old uncle that Mary attends.

Una de las cosas que más me gustaron y más me demostraron lo sobrada que va la autora de talento es la condescendencia cómica con la que trata a sus propios personajes en muchos momentos, fruto de la distancia que le concede el hecho de ser novela histórica.

“One morning, some weeks after her arrival at Lowick, Dorothea—but why always Dorothea? Was her point of view the only possible one with regard to this marriage?”
Throughout the course of its lengthy narrative Middlemarch questions the ethics and moral principles of its characters, urging its readers to interrogate their own judgement and previous assessments regarding individual behaviours, whole institutions, and social conditions. Woven through the various storylines, that are running parallel to one another in Middlemarch, there are many thoughtful discussions and reflections regarding marriage, politics, science, faith, and class. Like its full title suggests (Middlemarch, A Study of Provincial Life) the novel is primarily concerned with the lives and opinions of the inhabitants of Middlemarch. Within this small town many find it difficult to uphold their own boundaries, and their freedom and happiness are often hindered by the prejudices and jealousies that characterise provincial existence such as theirs. In their separate ways both Dorothea and Lydgate—the main two characters of this novel—wish to enact some sort of change in Middlemarch. Yet, their attempts are far too progressive for the relative conservative and close-minded neighbours. Lydgate methods are regarded with suspicion so that slowly but surely he becomes ostracised from his community. Perhaps his status as a ‘new arrival’ to Middlemarch is the cause of the people’s distrust of him and his ‘innovative’ methods (his aversion towards prescribing prescriptions is misconstrued to the extent of being regarded as a sign of medical malpractice; his keenness to get his hands on a ‘corpse’ seems uncivil). His close association Nicholas Bulstrode further antagonises the people of Middlemarch against him. His marriage to Rosamond Vincy occupies a significant part of his storyline and reminded me very much of another literary unhappy marriage. Similarly to Dr. Charles Bovary, Lydgate enjoys his work but isn’t well regarded by others. Rosamond struck me as a less fleshed out version of Madame Bovary: she is vain, frivolous, solipsistic, constantly afflicted by ennui, increasingly indifferent towards her husband’s woes, and harbours aspirations towards a more grandiose lifestyle. While Lydgate is by no means flawless I felt quite annoyed that the narrative sometimes presented Rosamond as a victim of sorts.Dorothea’s obsession to do good (one could even call it her raison d'être) is perceived by others as excessive and of bad taste. Dorothea seems to have aspirations to achieve the saintly status and stature of stature of a figure like Saint Theresa. Feeling like a saint without a cause she goes for the next best thing: similarly to Milton’s daughters, whom she fervently admires, she wants to help a brilliant man in his writing. 
“Now she would be able to devote herself to large yet definite duties; now she would be allowed to live continually in the light of a mind that she could reverence. This hope was not unmixed with the glow of proud delight—the joyous maiden surprise that she was chosen by the man whom her admiration had chosen. All Dorothea's passion was transfused through a mind struggling towards an ideal life; the radiance of her transfigured girlhood fell on the first object that came within its level. The impetus with which inclination became resolution was heightened by those little events of the day which had roused her discontent with the actual conditions of her life.”
Her dedication to her old and callous husband, as the narrative points out, verges on reverence. She seems blind to his flaws and to the possibility that his work will not be anything other than a product of a genius mind. Similarly to many other heroines (Samuel Richardson's Clarissa comes to mind) she seems more than willing to live a life of martyrdom, of becoming some sort of 19th century reincarnation of Joan of Arc. To me it seemed that Dorothea’s interest in her husband’s work was an attempt to live a more meaningful and intellectually stimulating life vicariously through him. Sadly for her Casaubon is not interested in sharing his ‘genius mind’ with her, and more than once rejects her kind offers to be of assistance to him. His failing health makes him all the more selfish and vindictive. Yet, even as Dorothea’s hope for a more fulfilling existence dwindles she seems unable to cast any blame on Casaubon choosing instead—as the good martyr that she is—to endure the disappointments of marriage with ubiquitous affability, and her affection and devotion to Casaubon will remain almost unaltered.
“Marriage, which was to bring guidance into worthy and imperative occupation, had not yet freed her from the gentlewoman's oppressive liberty: it had not even filled her leisure with the ruminant joy of unchecked tenderness. Her blooming full-pulsed youth stood there in a moral imprisonment which made itself one with the chill, colorless, narrowed landscape, with the shrunken furniture, the never-read books, and the ghostly stag in a pale fantastic world that seemed to be vanishing from the daylight.”
In spite of the slowness and vastness of the narrative Dorothea and Lydgate do not seem to undergo any signifiant character change but rather they seem to remain true to their beliefs however misguided these may be. In only one instance Dorothea seems to show awareness of her unhappy marriage with Casaubon while Lydgate is forced to leave Middlemarch not for the want of trying but due to external circumstances.Running alongside Dorothea and Lydagate’s narratives are the ones concerning other inhabitants of Middlemarch among which are the Vincy family, the Garth family, Nicholas Bulstrode, and Camden Farebrother. Some of the characters, such as the Cadwalladers, seem to function as a chorus, gossiping and interrogating the actions of the central figures of the narrative. Yet their role is not a minor one as it is up to the ordinary people of Middlemarch to sway and derail our main characters’ storylines. There are free-spirits such as Will Ladislaw who seem to function merely as the ‘wild-carefree card’ that—being an outsider in more ways than one—isn’t as affected by Middlemarch’s petty politics and prejudices. His deep infatuation with Dorothea diminishes somewhat this liberty of his.
“I have never done you injustice. Please remember me,” said Dorothea, repressing a rising sob.“Why should you say that?” said Will, with irritation. “As if I were not in danger of forgetting everything else.”
While I wasn't entirely sure why Will falls for Dorothea in such a way their slow (read: very slow, incredibly slow) romance made for some of the most tender and heartfelt moments of the whole novel. Speaking of heartfelt scenes, I was pleasantly surprised by the one that takes place towards the end of the novel which stars Dorothea and Rosamond (two characters then until that point had not shared any meaningful heart-to-heart).
“Rosamond, taken hold of by an emotion stronger than her own—hurried along in a new movement which gave all things some new, awful, undefined aspect—could find no words, but involuntarily she put her lips to Dorothea's forehead which was very near her, and then for a minute the two women clasped each other as if they had been in a shipwreck.”
Many of the characters’ have to contend with their personal weaknesses: there are those like Fred Vincy whose spindrift ways will alienate—with the exception of his mother—those around him, Lydgate’s pride will lead him to refuse time and again the help of others, while Dorothea’s devotion towards her husband will jeopardise her own chance at love and happiness.The narrative contends with the politics occurring in a provincial town in the 1830s, incorporating historical events and decrees within its various storylines. The resulting effect seems close to that of a painstakingly realised tapestry representing the most trivial aspects of a ‘provincial life’. Elliot contends with questions of ethics and morality by confronting her characters with various setbacks and challenges. Money seems to be a running topic in each of her characters’ lives: there are the ones who have too much for their liking, such as Dorothea, and the ones who find themselves ruin their reputations and their relationships with their loved ones for it.While I didn’t feel particularly sympathetic towards the novel's various characters (I despised Fred’s entitled whininess and found his portions of the story to be intolerable; Dorothea and Will seemed far less interesting and intriguing that what other characters make them to be) I loved George Eliot’s writing. She formed such beautifully articulated insights and observations as to make even the most ordinary of conversations or landscapes something of interest. Her calibrated style brought her characters to life: 
“Every nerve and muscle in Rosamond was adjusted to the consciousness that she was being looked at. She was by nature an actress of parts that entered into her physique: she even acted her own character, and so well, that she did not know it to be precisely her own.”
While much of the narrative concerns matters pertaining to a particular moment of time, there were many instances in which Eliot’s writing and narrative seem to transcend the limitations of their time. Throughout her novel she adds many remarks and details as to make her story all the more vivid in the readers’ mind: by specifying the tone of one’s words (“""Rosy!"" cried Fred, in a tone of profound brotherly scepticism.in a tone of profound brotherly scepticism”) or ones movements and gestures (“""No,"" said Will, shaking his head backward somewhat after the manner of a spirited horse”) she makes her characters and mannerisms all the more real. Moments of humour are often made at the characters' expenses. For example the narrative will address the characters as 'poor' as they are deeply involved in experiencing moments of personal anguish or self-commiseration. There are also some interesting insults and reproaches that could be surprisingly funny. For example Lydgate calls his wife a 'basil plant': 
“He once called her his basil plant; and when she asked for an explanation, said that basil was a plant which had flourished wonderfully on a murdered man's brains. ”
The narration was surprisingly innovative in that it seems to switch from a removed third-person perspective to a vigorous first-person one. The awareness shown by the narrative acquires an almost metafictional quality as it questions the traditional structure of the 'novel' and the representation of its characters as the 'heroes' and 'heroines' of their own stories. One of the setbacks of this novel is its length. Perhaps if I'd found the characters more compelling I wouldn't have minded as much but as it is they often frustrated or bored me so I don't think I'll be re-reading this anytime soon."

But after purchasing a beautiful new copy of it I think that sort of encouraged me to pick it up sooner rather than later, and I'm very glad I did! Middlemarch was (and still is) one of my Mother's favourites, between that and Jane Austen, I'd say she has wonderful taste. (We don't talk about Mantel's Wolf Hall). I remember when living at home seeing a rather worn copy sitting on her bedside table, and she explained to me it was her third or fourth read-through. I was always intrigued as to what was so wonderful about it, and as it turns out, rather a lot actually! First off, I have a deep fondness for the title, and the fact that Eliot decided to make it a rather small country town. That in itself is delicious and is enough to attract me, and it also throws off Jane Austen vibes, which is always welcome with me. I think the main aspect that makes this novel great are the deep and complex character portraits. These characters are not skeletal in form, and Eliot expertly draws the reader into Middlemarch, in among the flowers, the love and the scandal. I enjoyed how the female characters took center stage in this book and how Eliot describes rather often how the women are expected to be the doting wives while living through their husbands as the second sex. I'm glad she included this, but well, how times have changed! I adored her writing style and her wonderful use of words. Eliot could write a beautiful sentence, and that was also one of wit and borderline sarcasm such as this one:""Brooke is a very good fellow, but pulpy; he will run into any mould, but he won’t keep shape.""That now brings me to the plot. The plot consisted of the drama and devastation of two failed marriages, but to make up for that, there is another one, that is more successful, and is one of equality. While I loved her beautiful writing, I didn't love the predictability of that storyline. Reading about two people that were clearly going to be together, reading through their half a dozen misunderstandings, and the longing for the other when they are right in front of them just didn't do it for me, not this time. And to think, there was not even one mention in the entire novel of a shared kiss between the characters! I honestly found this a little strange. I can understand why this is one of the loved classics, and I certainly understand why my Mother has treasured it all these years. But, due to the romantic predictability I've had to rate it a little lower, but otherwise, I'm very happy to have finally read Middlemarch. "
111,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1262683-terry,Rating 5 out of 5,"I was wavering at around 4 - 4.5 stars on this, but in the end I have to give it a full 5. _Middlemarch_ by George Eliot (aka Mary Anne Evans) is, first and last, an extraordinary achievement. Other writers have worked with a large and varied cast. Other writers have written social commentaries with verve and wit. There is something about Eliot’s work, though, that is somehow unique. Two other writers come to mind with whom Eliot could (or even should), perhaps, be compared. Dickens is one of these, another Victorian writer concerned with the social mores of his day and whose cast of characters are as broad (and certainly stranger) than Eliot’s, but he leaves me cold. I have yet to enter the world of Jane Austen, whose own commentary on the society of her day is apparently one of ironic wit, but I find it hard to believe that she will excel Eliot (I gather her range of view is a little more restricted than Eliot’s). When I started this book I was overawed and quite frankly worried that I would never finish it (I don’t always have a great track record with high page-count classics…War and Peace has been more or less ear-marked as a failure for me after three attempts, all of which ended at exactly the same fairly early page), but Eliot has managed to pack a very long and incredibly intricate story into what I found to be a fairly quick moving and definitely enjoyable reading experience. Ok full disclosure here: I ‘read’ the audiobook version narrated by the engaging (and quite frankly wonderful) Nadia May. Just step-off all you audiobook haters, ok? There, now that that’s out of my system let’s proceed.The story of _Middlemarch_ is both large and small. Large both because it takes as its backdrop many of the great reforms that were beginning to change life in Britain in ways as varied as medicine, politics, transportation, and social life, as well as its large and varied cast of characters running the gamut of English provincial society. Small because it concentrates minutely on the internal thoughts and feelings that make up these individual’s private lives as well as the seemingly minor details of their everyday lives. While this book certainly takes a holistic approach to examining the lives of its characters it was ultimately, for me, a book about the various ways in which hopes and expectations can come crashing down in ruins (or at the very least be significantly changed) when they meet with reality…especially in the sphere of marriage. One might take as this book’s motto the insight of the character Dorothea Brooke relatively late in the novel that “Marriage is so unlike everything else. There is something awful in the nearness it brings.”Eliot presents us with a myriad of characters and families all of whose lives revolve around the insular world and concerns of the fictional town and environs of Middlemarch. To name only a few members of the cast that make up the vast narrative we have: the Brooke family made up of the saintly Dorothea, her pragmatic sister Celia and their buffoonish though lovable Uncle and guardian Arthur Brooke; the dry and pedantic scholar-clergyman Edward Casaubon and his distant and impoverished cousin Will Ladislaw; the genial though superficial Vincy family made up of father Walter, mother Harriet and two of their children: Fred and Rosamond; the fiery and idealistic new physician Tertius Lydgate; the sanctimonious and deluded banker Nicholas Bulstrode; the pragmatic and devoted Garth family (father Caleb, mother Susan and daughter Mary) as well as numerous others. What could have been an unwieldy mess becomes an almost balletic performance as Eliot guides us through the interweavings of these lives in moments of hope and crisis. What Lydgate says about his own life could just as easily have been said of Eliot’s challenges in creating the book: “…it’s uncommonly difficult to make the right things work: there are so many strings pulling at once.” She succeeds admirably.To go into the details of the plot would be of little use, or interest…just read the book! However I must say that Eliot’s ability to create a cast of fully rounded characters was extremely well-done. Some lean more towards villainy and others towards heroism, but none are simply black or white and all are given the sympathy of their creator who goes out of her way to be as impartial as possible when presenting their thoughts and motives. Everyone is a human being, however good or bad an example of the species they may be.Eliot also avoids the saccharine that might be expected in a Victorian novel about marriage. While I won’t say there are no happy endings, there are certainly no easy roads and even those endings considered happy have their own trials, worries and cost to those involved. Sometimes the cost may seem more than one ought to bear. More than one character comes to realize that in the necessity of interacting with others lies the quandary that “He had meant everything to turn out differently; and others had thrust themselves into his life and thwarted his purposes.” This could easily be the second motto of Eliot’s book. Still, regardless of the pain that interacting with others involves: the changing of one’s own plans in order to placate the desires and interests of another, the constant danger of rejection and pain, and, perhaps most of all, the constant threat of societal disapproval and public censure, we are forced to make the best (and sometimes the worst) of our relationships since we cannot live truly alone in utter isolation. It is a constant surprise to the characters of _Middlemarch_ how significantly their lives are able to be impacted and changed by others: “To think of the part one little woman can play in the life of a man, so that to renounce her may be a very good imitation of heroism, and to win her may be a discipline!” Looking back I’m not sure if I was able to pull this together into a truly coherent review, but suffice it to say that _Middlemarch_ truly is one of the greats. Eliot’s delightful prose, wry wisdom, and fully-fleshed out characters make what might have been an utter snore-fest into an insightful and enjoyable examination of what it means to be a member of the human community…in any era."

Wrong time to commit a crime, or at lease, an accessory to a crime. Ouch.Dorothea Brooke marries a man old enough to be her father, Edward Casaubon. He is a minister working on the “Key to all Mythologies.” So vast a theme that even he admits it may be too lofty in ambition. What attracts Dorothea to wed such a lofty man?

But fear not, our intrepid narrator is always there to guide us and make commentary with occasional bursts of wisdom.It reads like a soap opera.

It worked. The flow is phenomenal.The action takes place around 1830 in central England. During this time, a Reform Bill takes place when agricultural England is changing to a more modern industrialized country. Class and power, as well as the influence of religion, are more pressing than any noticeable changes. After all the subtitle of the book is “a study of provincial life.”And life in the country is full of challenges. The book celebrates its 150 anniversary this year. * The book is a web of characters and each one of them have something to say, something that connects them to others. We don’t live in a vacuum. We all can impact one another, whether we want to or not. That is our world. Today. And back then.And why not be cognizant of the other? Why not allow to see their point of view. Why not look for the good in others.

From the regal beginning of the first movement, to the grand finale of the Ode to Joy, the symphony is a perfect and complete whole - a journey where what you experience during the last notes is a finale and culmination of all the melodies (loud and quiet, allegro and slow) that came before: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5fav...Middlemarch is the literary equivalent of a Beethoven symphony: a perfectly composed and structured journey through the lives of different characters where the minute details of their daily lives illustrate universal human truths and are build up with immaculate precision over nearly 900 pages to bring the plot to its grand finale. Like with Beethoven, the finale reflects everything that came before and is the culmination of a masterfully-executed plot and hundreds of details and episodes that, like stones in a grand cathedral, are all perfectly placed to hold up the main altar. The first chapter and the reader's first glimpse into rural England contains a single episode of two sisters debating over how to split up a box of their mother's jewels - a seemingly ordinary, almost banal scene - that perfectly illustrates Eliot's ability to paint entire personalities and flesh-and-blood life with a single brushstroke. I've read entire novels without much caring what happens to its characters, or without even being able to clearly picture them, but by the second chapter of Middlemarch I'd firmly taken Dorothea's offered hand, ready to go along with her through this brick of a novel and finding myself full of empathy and curiosity about a woman who, in her deep religiosity and her desire to conform to and please her husband, is in many ways someone who logic would say I could never relate to or admire. But I did. Not in a blind awe of her desire to do good, but in admiration of her perseverance and those heartbreaking moments when she realises her shortcomings with honesty.

114,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/903390-werner,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is the third novel out of four by George Eliot (I originally read it back in the 90s) that I've read so far, after Silas Marner and Adam Bede. (The other is her novella The Lifted Veil, which was written in 1859 but not published until 1878.) Published serially (like many Victorian novels) in 1871-72, it's also a mature work written in her early 50s, later than any of her previous books I've read, and in fact her penultimate novel. As such, it shows her at the height of her powers as a writer. At nearly 800 pages, it's a much longer work than any of the other three I just named; it's also considerably more ambitious in terms of complexity of plot and messages. It's widely regarded as Fliot's masterpiece (and I think it probably is, though I haven't read all of her corpus). A number of modern critics even view it as the greatest Victorian novel, or even the greatest novel ever written in English. My own judgment there would be more circumspect (partly because there are a lot of novels I haven't read in both of the compared groups, and partly because picking single ""greatest"" novels in any group, IMO, is pretty subjective); but it's unquestionably a landmark classic and a major contribution to the world's literary heritage.While the two full-length novels mentioned above are historical fiction, set in the era (the close of the 18th century and the early 1800s) just before Eliot was born in 1819, she set Middlemarch in her own lifetime, where she could draw on her own memories for the real-life background. But there's still a considerable time gap between the setting of the novel and her present; it unfolds some 40 years and more earlier, in the provincial England, in and around the small fictional city of Middlemarch in ""Loamshire, "" of her girlhood in the late 1820s and early 1830s. (She was born in Warwickshire in the Midlands, in environs probably much like those in the book.) This was a time when England was in the beginning stage of great political, economic and social change: the agitation that would result in the epochal Reform Act of 1832, beginning the transition from oligarchy to a broader democracy; the Industrial Revolution and the spread of the new railroads which revolutionized the economy; the gradual beginnings of the slow breaking down of the rigid class system. All of these changes are reflected in the novel; but it also evokes England as it was before the changes, which would have a real flavor of nostalgia for many readers in 1872.But though Eliot depicts these dawning changes, and touches on what they might mean for the folk of Middlemarch, she doesn't do more than that; this is not primarily a novel of social analysis. She's sympathetic to reform; but she's even more concerned with human spiritual life, the basic human relationships of marriage and family, and above all with basic moral and philosophical issues. What are we here on earth for? And how should we be treating each other while we're here? Young gentlewoman Dorothea Brooke, our protagonist here, thinks seriously about these kinds of questions. Like Dinah Morris in Adam Bede, Dorothea's also an earnest Christian; unlike Dinah, she's not called to preach, but she does seek to actively live out her faith. Eliot herself had lost her Christian faith as a young woman, but still believed in God; questions of how we please God in this world remained important to her, and here as elsewhere, she uses her characters to explore them. (We have a vivid contrast here between two approaches, one that stresses serving others and helping each other to be better vs. one that stresses asceticisms and condemning shortcomings wherever we see them.) We're also given a very in-depth study of the dynamics of several marriages, and a critical look at the not always very serious or well informed way that couples go about getting engaged. (The modern divorce rate doesn't indicate great improvement in that area since 1832, or 1872.)I personally see Eliot's style as essentially Romantic, and there's much in this novel to evoke the reader's emotions. But the proto-Realist was strong in her, too, and we have here a vivid portrayal of true-to-life provincial English life in the days of her own youth. I would say that she actually blends those two schools of writing, in a felicitous way. Like Dickens, she has an enormous skill in creating highly nuanced and realistic characters (and she views all of them as compassionately as she can), who become as real and important to us as actual people; and that skill is much in evidence here. Though her humor isn't as exuberant as Dickens' sometimes is, it's there; she can flavor her writing in places with a dry wit that sometimes made me chuckle aloud. In common with Dickens, Thackeray and other Victorian novelists, she often engages in direct address to the reader (though she doesn't carry it to Thackeray's excess); that doesn't bother me. There are also echoes of Austen in some of the vibes here, which coming from me is a compliment (the world of her characters here isn't that far removed from that of the Regency). She undoubtedly read all three of these contemporary and preceding fellow writers; and she brooks comparison, in the same class.Yes, this is a VERY thick novel, which demands a substantial time commitment. It's worth every minute of it; it's a wonderful, immersive and rewarding read. If you appreciate serious fiction, I don't believe you'll be disappointed with it, in any way! I also realize that some readers have a mental block against Victorian diction. All I can say about that is that understanding the prose and sentence structure is NOT that hard, if you read with attention. If you refuse to even give it a try, you're cheating yourself out of a rich and emotionally and spiritually broadening reading experience.I would be remiss if I didn't end this review with a plug for the 1994 BBC miniseries adaptation, starring Juliet Aubrey (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108858/ ). Having now watched it twice, I can say it's an outstanding production, and as faithful to the book as a dramatic adaptation can be."
115,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64819771-jaylen,Rating 5 out of 5,"I read Middlemarch over the last three months. I am not well read in the classics, or even much backlist. However, I often see Middlemarch referred to as a “perfect novel,” and I was looking for a challenge. The final push to make me pick this up was Jonathan Franzen naming his latest planned trilogy “A Key to All Mythologies,” a reference to a character in Middlemarch’s (failed) attempt to write a magnum opus of theological insight by the end of his life. I do not think I can contribute much to the discussion around Middlemarch - I agree that if there was ever a perfect novel, George Eliot got pretty damn close. It is a novel of ideas, chock full of characters, marriages, death, ambition, failure, and it ties up all loose ends by the novel’s close. But what interests me most about Middlemarch, and something that I have been thinking about a lot recently, is the novel’s form and narration, and how Middlemarch feels like a blueprint for novelists who question the form of the text in the story they are telling.The novel is told from the perspective of an omniscient narrator, gliding around the characters and events while maintaining a sense of remove, adding philosophical insights with perceptive acuity. The novel’s subtitle is “A Study of Provincial Life.” Eliot explores the inner workings of a small town in the early 1800s, and uses this structure to make an attempt at understanding humanity. I have never read a novel of this scope that so intricately equips the function of its structure to reveal the beauty and failure of humanity. However, this is something my favorite novels do: as previously mentioned, The Corrections and Crossroads (two of my favorite reads last year), Franzen uses the structure of family in his novels to get at these questions; in autofiction, the writer inserts aspects of themself in the novel’s narrator to see what can be understood; in short stories, the writer uses physical brevity to explore within a limited scope. None of that is profound, but Middlemarch has helped me understand why I am appealed to certain fiction - the ambition with which my favorite writers approach the form, and are cognizant of its limitations yet makes it work anyway. Eliot mocks her own ambition in crafting Middlemarch through her characters and the slipperiness of humans and structures such as the novel, yet is able to succeed through moving at length through a small town. To add a touch of genius, George Eliot’s name misleads the reader, as she was a woman - underpinning all is her eschewing the assumption that a woman could not write this. Eliot embraces the joy of long, complex sentences, and closes the novel with the best final paragraph I’ve ever read in fiction.All this to say, it might be hyperbolic, but I do feel a bit changed as a reader, or rather enlightened as to why I connect with certain work to better understand my self and the joys and ills of living amongst others. This is a book I will revisit frequently throughout my life, to attempt to understand how Eliot has pulled this off."
116,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6014887-richard,Rating 5 out of 5,"This novel, like those of Jane Austen, is preoccupied with marriage. It revolves around the question of people being matched with the life-mates they are meant for. In Austen's works, most of the heroines survey the field, make their choices and expend their energies in choosing their partners--in the end usually the right ones--before marriage. The stories usually end with the leading lady at the altar with the leading man, upon which they live happily ever after. Unhealthy unions serve as warnings to the wise, and usually (though not always) take place away from centre-stage. However, in Eliot's Middlemarch (or Muddlematch, as I like to call it), the marriages are not always made in heaven, and the most dramatic action plays out after the knots are tied, rather than before. Eliot shows us what dire consequences can occur when a person ill-advisedly chooses the wrong partner. But she is such a subtle psychologist that she shows what leads to the choices, so that we understand a character's actions even though we might not always approve of them. Thus we sympathize with Dorothea Brooke, because we know the idealistic personality from which her motivations spring. We empathize with Lydgate (and to some extent Rosamond) even though we can see their hardships coming, because Eliot explains what makes them both tick. But the author critiques not only the moral choices of her characters but also the moral judgments of the town in which the story is set: the characters are not always wrong for going against the dictates of a conventional, rigid and xenophobic society. So what we get as a result is a sprawling novel with a varied cast of characters and rich, complex social commentary."

If these 800 pages were boiled down into something trenchant and contemporary, it would be brilliant and modern. Of course it is a masterpiece just as it is, written at a time when readers had many hours to read and savour and reread.Virginia Woolf says this novel was one of the few written for grown-ups. I aspire to be grown-up one day. Even so, I enjoyed it enormously, despite my immaturity.The recurrent theme here is ""reform"" in all its manifestations: medical, political, societal, voting reforms, land use reforms, education reforms, the intrusion of trains into the countryside—all these ingredients laid out under the wise benevolent gaze of Dorothea Brooke, or is that actually ""George Eliot"" herself we see here? Also lurking on every page, infusing every sentence but just beyond our grasp, is ""The Key to All Mythologies.""... the effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffuse: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts ... Besides being a timeless classic, this novel also manages to be modern and relevant. The more I look the more I see, and I've been seeing rather a lot of George Eliot — even in my dreams."

I've been trying to read more classics to appreciate how literature has shaped fiction writing throughout the centuries. Middlemarch always comes up as one of the most well-acclaimed classics, and hence why I've decided to read it. Let me just say that Middlemarch is exactly what I used to fear classics would be to me. In very simple terms, boring and verbose. There were some rare moments where I found myself engaged and wanted to read more than our planned schedule. But it was usually short-lived, until the very last 90 pages or so. And that last segment of the book was what saved Middlemarch from a 1-star rating. I buddy read this with the wonderful Celeste. We initially did so to temper the wretchedness of Fantine's story in Les Miserables. Ironically, Middlemarch became a slog while Les Miserables soared with its immensely compelling and beautiful writing. I won't write anymore about Middlemarch.

“If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel's heart beat, and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence.”
George Eliot might took on a man's name and wrote according to a prescribed formula by the male sex, but the perceptive insight that shaped the writing was that of a woman's, a superbly intelligent woman with astute, piercing observation skill and the subtle wit of a social critic but one with rare capacity to openness and compassion. It's not an easy matter to address sex/gender injustices and the contemptuous social conventions, especially when one was included in the injured party without being carried away by justifiable rage or bitter righteousness, but George Eliot managed it with profound wisdom.The story itself perhaps read boring and soo loongg at times when nothing thrilling actually happening about a bunch of ordinary people living their provincial lives. I, myself had only the average capacity to bear only small doses each day so to not ruin the book for me. But, there was a continuous awe every single time I open the last marked page, and my constant inside-my-head, silent applauses, staring at the crazy intellect of the writer. She didn't merely delve into types of personality and the complex relationship they had with expectations and rules of society, but she did more than most other writers did. She motioned and encouraged readers to see the pattern of different types of personalities, to watch and discern and analyse their thought process and intricate emotions, to reason out the 'why' and the 'how' a person came to their words and decisions, together with her, except of simply told you the conclusion of her own reflections. Her shrewd study into self-delusion, illusion and the disillusionment that came from hasty marriage, superficial judgment, the chock-hold pressure of a society that valued appearance over substance, reputation over character, the 'ideal' beauty, the 'perfect' manhood and womanhood, about the concept of pride, honor and duty, and how much one's life was not one's own. 
“Sane people did what their neighbors did, so that if any lunatics were at large, one might know and avoid them.”
 It was so expertly done, that by the time you come to the same conclusion she finally laid out for you, you felt sort of pleasantly surprise of your gained insight into the machination of personality types and its convoluted entanglement with community. Then of course, she did even more, this insanely far-sighted writer showed you how individuals had the unexpected potential to defy the pattern of their type and took contradictory actions that defied them but somehow also fit their temperament and internal motivation. 
“Character is not cut in marble - it is not something solid and unalterable. It is something living and changing, and may become diseased as our bodies do.” 
There was some really good twist, and the prose could be stunningly beautiful at times. Middlemarch was a book that probably wouldn't be such a good idea to be subjected as a mandatory read in schools--except for the like of Maeve Wiley and other similar-minded Wileys who had read all Jane Austen by the age of twelve--instead should be read according to each person's right time and right mood for it to be thoroughly appreciated.
""Certainly those determining acts of her life were not ideally beautiful. They were the mixed result of young and noble impulse struggling amidst the conditions of an imperfect social state, in which great feelings will often take the aspect of error, and great faith the aspect of illusion. For there is no creature whose inward being is so strong that it is not greatly determined by what lies outside it.""

120,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5650849-alan,Rating 5 out of 5,"Every time I read Middlemarch, it seems wholly new, yet familiar, like a new day. For a college teacher like me, it can seem the greatest English novel because Mary Anne Evans /""George Eliot"" has written about idealism and scholarly aspiration. Casaubon's scholarship, which attracts the bright, idealistic Dorothea, turns out to be a chimera. Yet the novel does not condemn Dorothea's aspirations, her desire to live beyond the propertied lesser aristocratic life assumed for her if she married Sir James.  Beyond this major love plot there are several others, including another idealist, the classic reformer physician Lydgate who wishes to write. (At least half the physicians I have known, many from college days, aspire to writing, and several of them do, a couple very well. Both medicine and writing can challenge mortality, though medicine never wins, and writing does very seldom--though it can.) Lydgate's idealism attracts less than his connections, which attract the daughter of the town's religious financier and philanthropist Bulstrode. In fact, there are few ""minor"" characters in the novel, each character full: Dorothea's hearty uncle Mr Brooke runs for Parliament without success, the parson Farebrother, the wealthy Featherstone, Bulstrode's niece Rosamund (who snags Dr Lydgate) and her brother Fred Vincy, and Dorothea's second love Will Ladislaw, whom she again surprises her family in choosing despite losing her inheritance through her choice.There are more, including the blackmailer Raffles. All fully drawn. Yet this novel may disappoint the 21st C reader. Where are the murders? The chase scenes? The drugs? (Even the first long novel, Clarissa, had drugs.) And where are the excruciating psychological portrayals, the humorless, ""serious"" prose. Well, Evans/Eliot is plenty serious, though there is much amusement here, too. A tragi-comedy like Shakespeare's best, the tragedy is human aspiration versusdelusion; the comedy is often that of character, interior divisions that are almost laughable, if they weren't so profoundly true. I feel I know people just like Dorothea and Lydgate-- maybe myself. One cannot understand Middlemarch until one has lived, been disappointed, recovered one's ideals, and yes, even--to have failed. So if you haven't done all these yet--and who would wish to have--read it again in your 30s or 40s or 50s. It gets better."

Eliot has a way of writing which is atemporal. So what if it was written how many years ago? It seems to have been written now, and by someone who knows everyone I see around me. Not english, but mexican. Elliots reading of human nature is that dead on. Not only that, there is something happening at all times. Like life I guess, but you just never notice when things are happening while you are living them. The small changes in your relationships, in your daily life, in how your ideals one day shift without you noticing. There are so many stories going around in the book, I won’t try to explain why they are all as great and valuable. It’s just the kind of book I think everyone has to read at one point of their lives, because it’s about human nature, and how that is the same no matter what country or century you are from."

I must say, I absolutely loved it. As in any other audio the voice and reading performance is so important and Juliet Stevenson is a master, and so is George Eliot.During that time I got to know most of the inhabitants of Middlemarch. The young and old, richer and poorer, good people, the selfles, the self centred, and the naive. There is a fair share of moralizing but the characters that appear in plenty, are so much more realistic, well profiled and self-aware than any other of their victorian contemporaries. George Eliot is the only victorian author whose characters I could actually imagine identifying myself with. They are not particularly exaggerated, they live in a different world but they are just as human as you and me.The Middlemarch ners a thousand pages and brilliant as it is, it requires a serious time commitment so if you have an opportunity I wholeheartedly recommend the Naxos recording performed by Juliet Stevenson."

George Eliot’s prose occasionally left me puzzled, and I strongly think I’ll have to revisit this classic. I found myself eagerly following the interactions of the people of Middlemarch. I was particularly interested in the actions of Dorothea and Lydgate, and frequently found myself either shaking my head at these two, or feeling frustrated with those immediately around them. Eliot’s characterization was wonderful, and her detailed portraits of the main and several of the supporting characters frequently had me impressed. Much of Eliot’s commentary on the politics of the day went over my head as I know nothing of the Reform act, though her portrayal of the doctors in Middlemarch had me annoyed with them for their conservatism and their actions towards their patients. I liked her portrayal of different marriages and the roles of each of the married women in these relationships, and how they navigated their lack of legal and personal power.These is no doubt a lot more I could say about this book, and a second reading would give me a better perspective on this many layered work."
124,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1910836-lobstergirl,Rating 5 out of 5,"Middlemarch at first seems like a novel which instructs us on the inevitability of life's disappointments. One of the saddest utterances I've ever heard comes from Will Ladislaw - ""There are certain things which a man can only go through once in his life; and he must know some time or other that the best is over with him. This experience has happened to me while I am very young - that is all."" Hopes truncated, passions adjusted, expectations modulated, are much of the story of Middlemarch. But it's also a comic novel; Eliot is an absolutely brilliant ironist. And the final sentence might be the loveliest sentiment in all literature."
125,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40516522-p,Rating 5 out of 5,"I am not, I must confess, terribly fond of Englishness. I suppose that being English I find it too familiar, and therefore unexciting. Or perhaps it is the case that my tough upbringing worked on me as a kind of aversion therapy, so that everything connected with my homeland strikes me as unappealing. I don’t know. Until I came to think about this review, I had never really sought to thoroughly explain to myself my preference for things foreign, a preference that extends to the women I have been in relationships with, landscapes [I find the English countryside incomparably dreary], art, film, and most other aspects of my private and intellectual life. One consequence of this attitude is that, I now realise, I’m particularly tough on English literature; I make fewer allowances, I let less slide. And so a novel written by an English person has a much steeper mountain to climb to reach the summit of my affections. Of course, some have managed it [Charles Dickens, for example, found the going relatively easy and has become a particular favourite; Jane Austen laboured somewhat, but got there in the end], but they are certainly in the minority up there. The purpose of all of this is to give some perspective to my claim that Middlemarch by George Eliot is not one of the finest English novels [a statement that coming from me would mean very little] but one of the greatest novels, period.With Emma it was, apparently, Jane Austen’s intention to create a heroine that her readers might not like immediately, or at all. To some extent she was successful in this endeavour, for many appear to find the title character irritating. Yet I have never felt that way about her; she is too energetic and silly to engender any kind of antipathy. However, if George Eliot had ever had, while writing this book, the same aim in mind she absolutely nailed it. In the interests of fairness, one ought to point out that Dorothea Burke is not without positive traits, such as her desire to help the poor, but she is without charm. Indeed, if I were asked to choose a bunch of adjectives to describe someone who I would cross the street to avoid, those pertaining to Eliot’s heroine – pious, self-denying, proud, judgemental – would be high on the list.For me it is these qualities that inspire her to forgo the more obviously appealing Sir James in favour of the musty Mr. Casaubon. In this respect, I was reminded very much of another strong-willed young woman, Isabel Archer from Henry James’ Portrait of a Lady. Both women, to themselves, justify their strange choices as wanting to be useful or challenged. Dorothea, in fact, likens Casaubon to Locke or Pascal; she thinks him a superior soul who will instruct and lead her, while she will aid him in his work. Yet, as the reader, one can’t help but think that marrying him is a kind of sacrifice, or martyrdom. She prides herself of not valuing frivolous things, and of being able to give them up [like horse riding, or jewels]; she doesn’t admit it to herself, but in picking Casaubon she gives up physical attraction, or at least trades it so that her intellect, her soul, can be, ahem, given a good seeing to instead. But even in this, even in denying herself, one could argue that there is a kind of vanity or egotism, that, just like Isabel, she chooses one, Casaubon, over another, Sir James, in order to show that she knows better, that she can make her own obscure choices, will go against the grain.That Eliot allows her heroine to get off on the wrong foot, so to speak, with her audience was a brave move. I can imagine some readers clapping the book shut and throwing it away from themselves, in order to be rid of the haughty Miss Brooke. However, if you do persevere I am confident that your attitude will change towards her, or will soften at least. The reconciliation between the reader and Dorothea is most likely to take place during her disastrous marriage to the mummy [as Chettem calls Casaubon]. Before the couple tie the knot one might have been in two minds as to whether it would be a success, because, although the ageing clergyman, who is not in the best health, may strike you as unsuitable for marriage with a young woman, Dorothea’s personality is such that the union does, on the surface, pretty much make sense. Even her Uncle concedes that it is not sheer folly, and that Sir James would not have been a good match; but once Dorothea is alone with her husband she quickly comes to realise that life with him will be a lonely, frustrating, and unhappy one. And Eliot uses the contrast between the husband and the wife to expose aspects of Dorothea’s character previously unknown to the reader, making her much more agreeable.Edward Casaubon, is, quite rightly, one of the most well-known and cherished characters in English fiction. Of all the people who feature in this vast novel, he was the one I best remembered from my first read, the one I would reference in conversation with others. Yet it was interesting to note during this reread that, while Eliot’s reputation is as a fair-minded author, a creator of finely crafted, sympathetic, flawed but human characters [and it is a deserved reputation], she is fairly relentless in mocking Casaubon, at times reaching Dickensian levels of satire. He is a terminally boring, self-absorbed and passionless man. Eliot makes this clear in numerous ways, but a number of his speeches [one about painting in particular – where he speaks about admiration without ever giving the impression that he feels any himself], and his letter to Dorothea asking for her hand in marriage, are almost painful to read in their formality and dryness.“MY DEAR MISS BROOKE, — I have your guardian’s permission to address you on a subject than which I have none more at heart. I am not, I trust, mistaken in the recognition of some deeper correspondence than that of date in the fact that a consciousness of need in my own life had arisen contemporaneously with the possibility of my becoming acquainted with you.”Perhaps the deepest thrust Eliot delivers is in relation to Casaubon’s work, his life’s work, called the Key to all Mythologies. It is an ambitious, comprehensive study that he is, of course, incapable of bringing to completion. He isn’t, then, only self absorbed, monomaniacal, and emotionally limp, but also completely ineffectual. I have known a number of people like this, such as my friend’s father, who left his wife, isolated himself from his friends and family, and then spent the next two decades faffing about with complex computer programmes and photography equipment, never getting within even sniffing distance of achieving anything. Or, to call forth a more famous example, what about Austrian author Robert Musil, a man of questionable temperament apparently, who dedicated the majority of his career to writing The Man Without Qualities, and yet died leaving the work unfinished? Indeed, what Eliot most impressively nailed with Casaubon is a particular kind of male behaviour or psychology or approach to the world. Many men are, to some extent, obsessive, are prone to cutting themselves off and getting lost in their hobbies or projects, be that football, gardening, or whatever. Moreover, a lot of us do not have a sense of our own ridiculousness, of how tedious we can be when we hold forth on these subjects; nor do we understand our own capabilities or limitations. This is especially true of men who are engaged in intellectual pursuits.I must admit that I had an uncomfortable realisation during the book that there is a very real danger, not that I am a little bit like Casaubon, but that I could go full Casaubon. And you should never go full Casaubon. For example, one of my girlfriend’s once left me because I had stopped paying her attention as I worked my way through Cao Xueqin’s multi-volume Chinese novel, The Story of the Stone [totally worth it though]. Moreover, I once decided that I wanted to be able to name the greatest novel from each major country and spent at least two years engaged in research; and this is without mentioning the years I spent on my own writing projects, including a [never completed, of course] work that was meant to incorporate all of the [hundreds of thousands of] pieces and fragments of prose I have accumulated throughout my life, which I believed would, in toto, result in a bildungsroman for the modern age! Casaubon is, in this way, a warning to people like me. He is the ghost that visits you on Christmas Eve, proposing to show you who you could turn into if you are not careful. In light of all this, it is not difficult to see why Dorothea suffers so much in the marriage. She thought she was aligning herself with a Locke, but instead got with an old man of no genius; she thought she would share in, and help with, his work, and yet she ends up being little more than an unpaid secretary or unvalued pupil.Since first reading Middlemarch I have, whenever the subject has arisen, claimed that it is the greatest novel ever written about love and relationships; and I have found, on this occasion, more than enough in the text to back that up. Indeed, while Casaubon and Dorothea are endlessly fascinating, I perhaps enjoyed the Lydgate and Rosamond storyline even more. As with the more famous couple, Eliot’s great skill is in being able to make you see the potential for success in the relationship, while also observing its possible flaws. Despite their age and attractiveness, Lydgate and Rosamond getting together isn’t mindless star-crossed lovers fluff; the coupling is psychologically sound. He thinks that her beauty and grace will enrich his life, which is understandable, and consistent with his personality, while her air of vulnerability, of needing to be looked after, is also consistent with his profession. Likewise, she wants a man who is not a Middlemarcher, who is superior, and Lydgate fits the bill. However, it doesn’t take a genius to work out that a marriage based on such superficialities will likely flounder.As central as love and marriage are to the narrative, what unites or defines almost all of the couplings formed during the duration of the novel is a sense of eventual disappointment or, more precisely, disillusionment. Indeed, this feeling plays a part in many other aspects of the story, including, for example, Fred Vincy’s dreams and ambitions. In this way, I can’t help but think that, while the name Middlemarch has served the book adequately, the two most appropriate titles were already taken: Great Expectations and Lost Illusions. All of the major characters approach life hopefully, with expectations of success, and yet nearly all find their hopes dashed.“Having once embarked on your marital voyage, it is impossible not to be aware that you make no way and that the sea is not within sight–that, in fact, you are exploring an enclosed basin.”Again, Dorothea and Casaubon provide an interesting example. As noted, Dorothea finds that marriage is not all she thought it would be. Yet, crucially, she cannot really fault her husband; he did not make false promises, nor did he change upon signing the contract. It is more a case that Dorothea, like most people entering into relationships, took every small example of admirable traits or behaviour during the courtship to be but a taster of the huge amounts of such qualities the person in question would have in store. Likewise, Casaubon is also left disappointed; he imagined Dorothea would ease his strain, would support, rather than question, or make demands of him. To return to Fred Vincy, he considered it a fait accompli that old Featherstone would leave him a sizeable legacy, but things do not work out as he envisaged. In fact, the only people who avoid disappointment are those who never had ideals for living, or great hopes, in the first place, such as Mary Garth. As a consequence, I’m not quite sure what the novel’s message really is. Do not hope? Have small ambitions? Be sensible? Maybe. Or perhaps to speak about a message is to turn down the wrong road. I prefer to believe that Eliot wasn’t interested in pedagogy, that her novel is simply showing you life: in its smallness, its meanness, its disappointments, as well as its joys and its successes.While there isn’t an out-and-out message, Middlemarch does engage with important issues, such as the women question, as I have anachronistically heard it called. As one progresses through the book one comes to realise that Dorothea could be viewed as a kind of unassuming feminist icon. What defines her character is a desire to be active and useful; she draws plans for poor housing and wants to donate to the local hospital. She may not want equality, or never voices that idea, but she does want to do good, to contribute to society. On the other hand, many of the male characters treat her as ‘a vulnerable little woman’; her uncle, for example, worries about her overtaxing herself, and thinks that too much knowledge is bad for a woman; Sir James Chettam thinks that she ought to have been given stronger guidance [i.e. be told what to do and what not to do] when weighing up Casaubon’s proposal, indicating that he believes her unfit to make this so important decision. It is vital, for me, that Eliot allows Dorothea to be both feminine and strong; she is vulnerable, but no more than anyone else, than any man, and she is emotional. While her decision to marry Casaubon is shown to be a poor one, she at least made it herself and insisted on it in the face of opposition. Through her Eliot explores how difficult it was for women to find a useful place in society, one where she is allowed to be significant and make a difference. Lydgate is a doctor, her uncle dabbles in politics, and so on, but she is expected to be little more than a wife.In terms of Eliot’s style, she has a fine authorial voice: frequently wise and warm, while also capable of irony and a kind of wry humour. I’ve read elsewhere that some find her omniscient, Godly approach not to their taste, and while there were occasions when she unnecessarily breaks the spell [for example, when she addresses the reader and notes that you may or may not be interested in so-and-so], I found it, generally speaking, not to be a problem. What certainly is worth trumpeting is her ability with metaphors. This is an area that I am particularly interested in, for I think that it is a dying, or dead, art [if you’re going to liken, say, a pale face to milk or ivory then you might as well have not bothered at all]. In fact, most rappers turn out better metaphors that this generation’s acclaimed novelists. Eliot’s, however, are supreme; they are constantly surprising and illuminating [which is the point of a metaphor – to enable you to better understand, or appreciate, the thing that is being described by way of comparison].Before I conclude, I want to outline some minor criticisms. I said at the beginning of this review that you will probably come to change your mind about Dorothea, that although she seems unlikable at first, I am confident that you will come to like or admire her. Yet one of the failings of the novel, for me, is that her character changes too abruptly, that, more specifically, she loses her illusions regarding Casaubon too suddenly. It is not that Eliot does not provide justification, it is simply that the reasons she gives are not entirely consistent with the character of the Dorothea that we meet in the opening stages of the book. For example, during the marriage Casaubon is shown to be lacking passion, and this dismays his wife. Yet she never indicated a desire for passion prior to the marriage, only intelligence and learning [which he has]. Furthermore, by the end of the book Dorothea has become a kind of Jesus figure; forgiving, full of love and understanding. That’s lovely and all, but it just seems too epic a journey, too big a change, to have undertaken in the course of the novel. Another problem with the book is that Will Ladislaw, who is the closest Eliot comes to a romantic hero, is dull as shit. Seriously, I yawned my way through almost all his bits. In any case, none of that was enough to spoil my enjoyment or to dampen my affection.Finally, then, if this review seems somewhat confused or poorly structured [I hope it doesn’t but I fear it does], or far too long, that is because I struggled to write and edit it. However, I struggled not because my ideas wouldn’t come, or would not allow themselves to be moulded into coherent sentences and paragraphs, but simply because I had so much I wanted to say, because every time I started to lay down my thoughts and feelings I was aware that there were other fascinating aspects of the novel that I could be engaging with. I felt, as I wrote, always as though I was grappling with something bigger than me, like a fisherman trying to land a shark. That, for me, is the sign of a truly great book – one that will not politely submit itself to a nicely-formed, perfectly manageable 1000 word review. Oh no, Middlemarch made me drag this this out of myself, all 3000 words of it."

La caratterizzazione dei personaggi (almeno di tutti quelli che hanno una certa rilevanza nelle vicende) è di quelle che piacciono a me: caratteri con tante sfumature (nessuno è del tutto piacevole o, viceversa, sgradevole) che si modificano in seguito agli accadimenti, positivi o negativi che siano; questo non significa che diventano tutti migliori ma che le esperienze entrano a far parte del loro bagaglio personale e influiscono su atteggiamenti e comportamenti. Il processo di interiorizzazione non è mai del tutto consapevole, anzi l’aspetto inconscio (nel senso di non consapevole) gioca un ruolo rilevante nella formazione dei caratteri e delle motivazioni. Le illusioni ottiche ci fanno riflettere sulla molteplicità di rappresentazioni mentali che gli stessi elementi della realtà possono generare. Riuscire a mettere in comunicazione tali significati è alla base di una comunicazione autentica.Tutti i personaggi di Middlemarch devono affrontare la disillusione che interviene quando si scopre che le proprie rappresentazioni mentali spesso non hanno una totale corrispondenza con la realtà, soprattutto se essa è costituita da altre persone (partner, genitori, figli) che, a loro volta, hanno proprie rappresentazioni; l’autrice, attraverso i suoi personaggi, ci dice chiaramente che la capacità di modificare la nostra visione del mondo inglobando nuove idee e prospettive è un elemento essenziale per entrare in relazione con gli altri e vivere con serenità e felicità la propria vita. 
La morale della storia è tutta qui […] I giovani sentono dell’attrazione gli uni per gli altri prima di sapere cosa sia la vita, e pensano che basti stare insieme perché tutto sia come un giorno di festa, ma i giorni di lavoro arrivano in fretta, cara.
I continui sfoggi di erudizione dell’autrice sono l’aspetto meno gradevole del romanzo insieme a un uso eccessivo (almeno secondo me) delle figure retoriche ma nel complesso la mia valutazione è positiva: penso che in futuro leggerò altro di Mary Anne Evans."

Eliot really knew people, how they interact for good and ill, how they sometimes use others, love or manipulate others. And she knew British towns and town living. What a mixture. In a wonderful way she was able to mix these things together in Middlemarch.I will extend my reading to see how she deals with other members/levels of society in the future.Addendum: As I read this on my Kindle Fire, I made much use of the highlighting feature to capture some of Eliot's great sentences and thought. I was also struck by her judicious use of quotes from major works through history."

129,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13122795-w-d-clarke,Rating 5 out of 5,"In David Lodge's funny and perceptive ""Campus"" novel   Nice Work Robyn Penrose, one of the book's two main characters, is a university English professor who teaches Victorian literature from a feminist and post-structuralist (Lacan, Derrida, etc.) perspective. Accordingly, her lectures on Eliot, Dickens, Gaskell, et al. view the social norms and aesthetic strategies of the earnest Victorians from the ironic perspective of the emancipated, post-truth 1980s academic left: “The writers of [Victorian] novels were never able to resolve in fictional terms the ideological contradictions inherent in their own situation in society. At the very moment when they were writing about these problems, Marx and Engels were writing the seminal texts in which the political solutions were expounded. But the novelists had never heard of Marx and Engels—and if they had heard of them and their ideas, they would probably have recoiled in horror, perceiving the threat to their own privileged position. For all their dismay at the squalor and exploitation generated by industrial capitalism, the novelists were in a sense capitalists themselves, profiting from a highly commercialised form of literary production.”[...]“Unable to contemplate a political solution to the social problems they described in their fiction, the industrial novelists could only offer narrative solutions to the personal dilemmas of their characters. And these narrative solutions are invariably negative or evasive. In Hard Times  the victimised worker Stephen Blackpool dies in the odour of sanctity. In Mary Barton the working-class heroine and her husband go off to the colonies to start a new life. Kingsley’s Alton Locke emigrates after his disillusionment with Chartism, and dies shortly after. In Sybil, the humble heroine turns out to be an heiress and is able to marry her well-meaning aristocratic lover without compromising the class system, and a similar stroke of good fortune resolves the love stories in Shirley and North and South. Although the heroine of George Eliot’s Felix Holt renounces her inheritance, it is only so that she can marry the man she loves. In short, all the Victorian novelist could offer as a solution to the problems of industrial capitalism were: a legacy, a marriage, emigration or death.”It is doubly ironic, then, that, for all her talk of phallic capitalist Victorian chimneys and our Lacanian inability to inhabit the real, by the end of Lodge's novel Robyn finds that the narrative arc of her own life includes almost all of those abhorrent Victorian tropes: she inherits a legacy, rebuffs a marriage proposal, and just-about emigrates, exactly the kind of thing that serves to either complicate or ""resolve"" the plots of Victorian novels, for better or worse. George Eliot's Middlemarch is no exception to this rule (& if you are worried about spoilers, read no further!).If Robyn is right in her above lecture about the conflicted, contradictory nature of the writing of these socially aware but sentimental 19C novels, that contradiction remains present for the 21C reader as well. Speaking personally, if I have thought that readers of the likes of Harry Potter are merely seeking a magical escape route from reality (and I must confess that that thought has tempted me towards judgemental attitudes on occasion), then what of my own reading of Middlemarch? Is it not just as mired in antiquated, antediluvian notions of honour and morality (not to mention now-shopworn narrative strategies and literary techniques) as those children's books are? Why would I (or you) possibly be reading Middlemarch when there is so much important modernist/post-whatever/experimental fiction to be wrestling with, fiction that has, one assumes, digested the narrative strategies of its forbears and has simply moved on? Well, Middlemarch does indeed embody those Victorian contradictions, and it does have its escapist pleasures, but escapism and contradiction are always and everywhere put into question by a fierce, critical intelligence in this novel. George Eliot's narrator is completely in charge of her fictional universe, and probes the inner workings of her characters with the precision and delicacy of another Victorian trope: the amateur naturalist/butterfly collector: each all-too-human agonist is pinned to the paper and examined under a magnifying glass, their self-talk serving to mercilessly mirror their unexamined assumptions about their world: no character in Middlemarch is immune from such errors, and even supposed villains retain some redeeming qualities: Eliot is a master of (and one of the originators of) psychological realism, and I would ask you, why read contemporary psychological realism when you can go to the source?Admittedly, I did find the ""worthiness"" and ""probity"" of her heroines Mary Garth and Dorothea Brooke a bit wearying at times. They (along with heroes Lydgate, Fred Vincey and Laidslaw as well) are ""NICE"" in the Victorian-and-before, accreted senses of that word:  from ""fussy, fastidious"" (late 14c.); to ""dainty, delicate"" (c. 1400); to ""precise, careful"" (1500s, preserved in such terms as a nice distinction and nice and early); to ""agreeable, delightful"" (1769); to ""kind, thoughtful"" (1830). [etymonline.com]. The novel does foreground the workings of its oft-repeated word ""conscience"" a hell of a heck-of-a-lot, and the heroes and heroines can be maddeningly self-defeating when honour's at stake. Whatever got into them, those Victorians, you ask, to be so scrupulous so relatively soon after the freewheelin' late 18C and Regency periods? Well I shall pull in another writer, Terry Eagleton, whose massively learned   The Ideology of the Aesthetic  will explain this, er, nicely: That there might be a moral ""sense"" that is analogous to the apprehension of beauty and that is somehow ""'antecedent to [utilitarian] advantage and [self-]interest and […]the foundation of them'""(Francis Hutcheson), is something that the later utilitarians would never understand, yet that supposed god of self-interest, Adam Smith, in his Theory of Moral Sentiments, concurs:  When we contemplate it in a certain abstract and philosophical light, it appears like a great, an immense machine, whose regular and harmonious movements produce a thousand agreeable effects. As in any other beautiful and noble machine that was the production of human art, whatever tended to render its movements more smooth and easy, would derive a beauty from this effect, and, on the contrary, whatever tended to obstruct them would displease on that account: so virtue, which is, as it were, the fine polish to the wheels of society, necessarily pleases; while vice, like the vile rust, which makes them jar and grate upon one smother, is as necessarily offensive.If morality is a harmoniously self-regulating, beautiful machine, it is also a graceful dance that is ""beyond all mere calculation"", carries itself with a sprezzatura, a ""cavalier insouciance"" worn lightly on the sensibilities like an ""easy habit"", a political unconscious that ensures political hegemony while feeling subjectively like nothing of the kind, as it has been ""imprint[ed…] upon our sensibilities"" the way that supreme Artist has imprinted His likeness upon our beings.Most of the appealing characters in Middlemarch carry the ""law"" within them in such a manner that constructing a worthy life becomes just such an art form. Those characters who deviate from the ""self-regulating, beautiful machine"" of this law (Fred's gambling, Lydgate's financial excesses, Bulstrode's evasion of his dodgy past, Rosemond's unwise attachment to Laidslaw...) receive a comeuppance that encourages them to correct themselves, and if they do not always learn to fine tune their own inner compasses (e.g. Rosemond never does lose her taste for superficial finery and social position), the narrator's wise, Mosaic tone definitely encourages the reader to learn by their example.Indeed, conforming to this law is deemed to be the chief good of a well-lived life: almost all action is individual, interpersonal and local, and progressive politics looks a lot like well-meaning charity, ""noblesse oblige"". If Laidslaw does end up fighting for reform in Parliament, there is little sense of collective action in it. Nor do the huddled masses get much of a look-in: this book is largely about interactions amongst and conversations between ""individuals and their families"", as good old Maggie Thatcher used to say, even if abstract notions of society and the common good form the subject matter of these from time to time. And though the novel is set at the time of Chartism, very little political philosophy gets bandied about in the provincial Midlands burgh that is Middlemarch (for that, try Felix Holt, The Radical, which I also found quite stimulating)No, much of the broader social commentary and many of the ideas come across, rather, in asides of the narrator's, which is where the real pleasure of reading Middlemarch arises. E.g.:Is there any yoked creature without its private opinions?We all of us, grave or light, get our thoughts entangled in metaphors, and act fatally on the strength of them.But we all know the wag's definition of a philanthropist: a man whose charity increases directly as the square of the distance.... Conservatism, which consisted in holding that whatever is, is bad, and any change is likely to be worse.It is in these acts called trivialities that the seeds of joy are for ever wasted, until men and women look round with haggard faces at the devastation their own waste has made, and say, the earth bears no harvest of sweetness—calling their denial knowledge.""Science is properly more scrupulous than dogma. Dogma gives a charter to mistake, but the very breath of science is a contest with mistake, and must keep the conscience alive."" Alas! the scientific conscience had got into the debasing company of money obligation and selfish respects.So should you read it then, this fat bastard of a realist novel? Yes, by George IV, you should! I myself was never a huge fan of Ms. Eliot's (always having preferred, in the past, Dickens's hyperbole to her sharp sobriety), but I am now; and, having dispensed with yet another cyclopean prejudice, I look forward to The Mill on the Floss and Daniel Deronda—as admirable, necessary correctives to living and reading the 20th and 21st centuries!"

Quizás por la época en que vivió se sintió obligada a no mostrar del todo las realidades de la vida y aunque hiciera concesiones para satisfacer al público, ahí, tras esa melancolía, deja suficiente poso para que el lector que quiera, capte ciertas carencias de sus personajes tras la fachada de aparente felicidad.""Pero lo que llamamos desesperación no es a menudo más que anhelo doloroso de una esperanza que no encuentra donde alimentarse.""Middlemarch es el retrato de una pequeña comunidad, ficticia, donde aparecen casi todos los estratos sociales representados por algunos personajes clave y a través de ellos la Eliot hace un examen de la familia, la clase social, el matrimonio sobre todo como fin para alcanzar algunos intereses, la doble moral y la hipocresía social. Por la cantidad de personajes que van surgiendo a lo largo de la novela, puede resultar complicado hablar del argumento, sin embargo, me gustaría detenerme en los que yo creo son los dos personajes centrales, en torno al cual se centra esta novela: por una parte Dorothea Brooke, y por la otra, el doctor Tertius Lydgate, dos personajes que serán ejemplo de lo que George Eliot quería demostrar: la curiosidad intelectual representada en Dorothea, muy vedada a las mujeres de la época, y por otra parte, los aires de cambio cientificos que venían de la mano del médico, Lydgate. Dos personas que de alguna forma podrían pertenecer más al futuro de una era que estaba a las puertas, que al momento en que vivieron.""La mayoría de los que sentimos interés por algún tema recordamos una mañana, o alguna hora nocturna, en la que nos subimos a un taburete más alto para alcanzar un volumen todavía inédito de la biblioteca familiar, o nos sentamos con la boca abierta para escuchar a alguien a quien nunca habíamos oído o, por simple ausencia de libros, empezamos a escuchar alguna voz interior como principio de nuestro interés.""La trama que gira en torno a Dorothea ocupa un lugar clave en Middlemarch, quizá porque en ella acaben confluyendo el resto de las tramas y personajes. Dorothea apenas tiene veinte años cuando comienza la novela pero su curiosidad intelectual, sus ansías de aprender y de estudiar, le son limitadas por la época que le tocó vivir, y aunque en un futuro pudiera convertirse en la heredera de su tío, estas ansías de saber le serán vedadas debido al hecho de que se espera que contraiga matrimonio. Dorothea es uno de esas mujeres de su época que siempre estará en desventaja por no haber nacido hombre y sin embargo, aunque sus talentos la hagan estar al mismo nivel de ellos, su frustración ante el hecho de que no avanzará por sí misma, la hará sacrificar sus deseos y entender que la única forma de hacer cosas será junto a un marido o algún familiar que se convierta en una especie de custodio. A lo largo de la novela, sus expectativas se verán continuamente limitadas, incluso sacrificándolas en pos del amor...""Parece tener lo que nunca he visto antes en una mujer: una fuente de amistad para los seres humanos... Los hombres pueden ser amigos suyos.""El hecho es que cuando Dorothea conoce a Edward Causabon, comete uno de los mayores errores de su vida al casarse con él. Causabon, un erudito bastante mayor que ella con ningún sentido del humor, que busca esposa solo porque necesitará una “esposa/secretaria” que se ocupe de organizarle su trabajo, la defraudará casi desde el momento de la boda porque Dorothea en ningún momento fue consciente, en su ingenuidad más ciega, que Causabon buscaba una esposa convencional que no le cuestionara nada. Desde el momento en que Dorothea, que quiere encontrar en su futuro marido una especie de tutor que amplie sus horizontes intelectuales, percibe que se ha equivocado, será ya demasiado tarde: está casada y casi enterrada en una especie de tumba junto a un hombre que desde el primer momento es consciente que la inteligencia de Dorothea ensombrecerá su “falsa” erudición, y desde ese momento la despreciará:""¿Cómo era posible que en las semanas transcurridas desde la boda, Dorothea, sin advertirlo con claridad, sintiera, con sofocante melancolía, que las amplias perspectivas y las brisas refrescantes que había soñado encontrar en la mente de su marido quedaban reemplazadas por antecámaras y pasillos llenos de recodos que parecían no conducir a ningún sitio?""El entusiasmo y la ingenuidad inicial de Dorothea, se verá rápidamente aplastado por el chantaje emocional y afectivo que le hará Causabon desde el momento en que contraen matrimonio. George Eliot, durante los tramos en los que se dedica a narrarnos este desgraciado pasaje en la vida de Dorothea, hará una descripción llena de matices de la ambigüedad de este matrimonio en el que Dorothea poco a poco irá despertando al vacío de su vida. De vez en cuando se verán atisbos de esa energía y luminosidad que esconde en su fuero más íntimo Dorothea, pero serán solo atisbos, ráfagas, que esconderá enseguida debido a un marido que coarta continuamente sus expectativas.""A veces, cuando Dorothea estaba con otras personas, parecía haber en ella un aire de reposo tan completo como si fuese un retrato de santa Bárbara contemplando desde su torre el aire transparente, pero aquellos intervalos de quietud hacían aún más notable la energía de sus palabras y su emoción cuando algún estímulo exterior despertaba su interés.""[…]""-¿En qué piensan ustedes, los caballeros, cuando están con la señora Causabon?-En ella misma -dijo Will.- Cuando uno ve a una mujer perfecta, nunca piensa en sus atributos... tan solo es consciente de su presencia. La señora Causabon es demasiado distinta a otras mujeres para que pueda comparársela con ellas.”[...]""-¡Explicar! ¡Decir a un hombre que explique cómo ha ido a parar al infierno! ¡Explicar mis preferencias! Nunca he sentdo preferencia por ella, como tampoco siento preferencia por respirar. A su lado las demás mujeres no existen. Antes tocaría su mano si estuviera muerta que la de cualquier otra mujer viva.""El otro personaje central, Tertius Lydgate, se verá enfrentado a unos conflictos muy parecidos a los de Dorothea, en este caso relacionados con su carrera como médico. Lydgate, un médico que cree en la nueva ciencia, en la prevención de las enfermedades, formado en el extranjero y con una mirada al futuro, se verá poco a poco limitado por la estrechez social de Middlemarch, donde las apariencias y la doble moral le jugarán tan malas pasadas que le harán entrar poco a poco en un estado de desesperanza y melancolía en el que pronto le hará perder ese estado de ilusión inicial que tenía al llegar a Middlemarch. Su matrimonio con Rosamund de Vincy, que le usará para avanzar socialmente, será otro punto donde George Eliot incidirá especialmente para mostrarnos esos grises que se atisban tras los velos de las apariencias. El proceso durante el cual Lydgate conocerá a Rosamund y poco a poco se verá preso de ella, hasta desembocar en la desesperanza de una vida matrimonial sin salida, me han parecido todo un prodigio de disección de la naturaleza humana por parte de la Eliot.""Y Rosamund hacía comentarios acertados; porque era inteligente, con ese tipo de inteligencia que capta todos los tonos menos el humorístico. Afortunadamente, nunca trataba de bromear, y esa quizás la prueba más clara de su inteligencia.""[...]""Rosamund, de hecho, estaba enteramente ocupada con Tertius Lydgate, pero no para interesarse por él en sí mismo, sino en su relación con ella..""[…]""A Lydgate, como es lógico, nunca se le ocurrió quedarse mucho tiempo con ella y, sin embargo, daba la impresión de que las breves conversaciones impersonales que sostenían estaban creando esa peculiar intimidad que consiste en mostrarse tímido.""[...]""Pero, una vez que ha existido, la intimidad que proporciona la mutua turbación, en la que cada uno nota que el otro está sintiendo algo, tiene unos efectos que no es posible eliminar. Hablar del tiempo y de otros temas parece una vana estratagema y el comportamiento difícilmente llega a ser natural a no ser que se reconozca con franqueza la existencia de una mutua fascinación.""[…]""Lydgate volvió a caer en lo que Rosamund denominaba, para sus adentros, melancolía: nombre con el que abarcaba todo lo relativo a sus meditabundas cavilaciones sobre otros temas distintos de ella, así como el gesto preocupado de la frente y el desinterés por todas las cosas ordinarias como si estuvieran mezcladas con hierbas amargas, y que en realidad constituían una especie de barómetro de su irritación...""[…]""Es un momento terrible en una vida joven aquel en que se descubre que la intimidad del vinculo amoroso se ha transformado en capacidad para hostigar.""[...]""Lydgate había aceptado las limitaciones de su futuro con tristeza resignada. Había elegido a aquella criatura frágil y llevaría el peso de su vida en brazos. Tenía que caminar como pudiera con aquella carga a cuestas.""Dentro de este microcosmos que es Middlemarch, hay bastantes más personajes que harán surgir dilemas, conflictos económicos, morales, emocionales, pero imposible detenerme en cada uno de ellos pero quizás el aspecto que más me ha interesado de esta novela es la forma en la que George Eliot se aproxima a ellos, nada sentimental ni dramática sino diseccionándolos como si ella misma estuviera en un laboratorio y experimentara con ellos de cara al lector, y sobre todo en muchos momentos me ha parecido una aproximación muy adelantada a su tiempo por parte de la autora, porque en algún momento usa la primera persona para dirigirse al lector o para hacer un comentario personal, relacionado siempre con sus personajes o con la situación emocional que en ese momento estuviera narrándonos. George Eliot no los juzga, y tengo que decir que se muestra en momentos hasta generosa con ellos, por ejemplo en el caso de Edward Causabon, intentando no influir negativamente en el lector, y dejando que sea el lector quien vaya detectando poco a poco la naturaleza de ciertos hechos. Además, en una historia tan coral como esta, veremos el mismo punto de vista, analizado por diferentes personajes, lo que da profundidad a algunas tramas, en el sentido de que George Eliot nos está ampliando la visión continuamente, igual que en la vida misma.""-Cuando se quiere manifestar algo que está muy por encima del simple agradecimiento, vale más escribir que hablar... al menos no se oye lo.pocos convincentes que son las palabras.""Middlemarch es una novela magnífica en lo que respecta al análisis que hace de una comunidad donde los conflictos sociales y religiosos, en un momento que la sociedad se enfrentaba a una serie de cambios continuamente enfrentados al enquistamiento del viejo mundo, convertían a sus personajes en una especie de experimentos bajo la pluma de la Eliot. Sin embargo, tengo la sensación de que en una novela tan voluminosa, ha habido personajes que se han quedado a medias, sin terminar de desarrollarse, como por ejemplo el personaje de Mary Garth, quizá el personaje femenino más interesante de la novela, y que a la mitad, comienza a desdibujarse en favor de otras tramas, y por otra parte, también termino la novela con la sensación de que ciertas concesiones finales no terminan de encajar con la trama del resto de la novela, aunque eso sí, el poso de melancolia y de desesperanza que deja entrever la Eliot en su final, entre lineas, puede resultar fascinante. Y quizás lo más interesante de esta novela sean esos personajes luminosos representantes de los nuevos cambios que se avecinaban, enfrentados a esos otros personajes todavía detenidos en el viejo mundo que estaba a punto de desaparecer.""Cuando giraba deprisa la cabeza, su cabello parecía desprender luz, y algunas personas estaban convencidas de reconocer en aquellos chispazos una clara señal de genio. El señor Casabon, por el contrario, no dejaba escapar el menor rayo de luz.""https://kansasbooks.blogspot.com/2022... "

She thinks by marrying an educated older gentleman that she can become a true partner in his academic pursuits; however, she is sorely disappointed as she runs up against the patriarchal society and its narrow view of a woman’s ability to contribute. We meet many other residents of Middlemarch, including Dorothea’s guardian, sister, and brother-in-law; Bulstrode, the banker; Lydgate, the newly arrived doctor with his advanced medical thinking; Lydgate’s beautiful wife, Rosamond; Fred and Mary, a young couple hoping to marry; and Will Ladislaw, a young man with a background of lesser repute who is attracted to Dorothea, but prohibited by circumstances from courting her. I will not attempt to summarize the plot since this is an extremely long book with lots of characters. I counted four main storylines. It is primarily character-driven until near the end. This is a true Victorian novel, published in 1871 and set in the 1830s in a fictional small English town. It addresses social issues of the author’s time, such as the role of women, reluctance to adopt medical advances, and social stratification. We are privy to the characters’ inner thoughts and can easily see how actions can be misconstrued. We identify the mismatched partners, and their marital difficulties are not surprising. The writing style is elaborate, using many paragraphs to say what we would now express in a couple sentences. This style will obviously not be for everyone. I knew what I was getting into, but even so, I had to read several passages more than once to get the gist of what was being conveyed. “But this vague conviction of indeterminable guilt, which was enough to keep up much head-shaking and biting innuendo even among substantial professional seniors, had for the general mind all the superior power of mystery over fact. Everybody liked better to conjecture how the thing was, rather than simply to know it; for conjecture soon became more confident than knowledge, and had a more liberal allowance for the incompatible. Even the more definite scandal…was, for some minds, melted into the mass of mystery, as so much lively metal to be poured out in dialogue, and to take such fantastic shapes as heaven pleased.”I think in current times this novel would have been pared down considerably and focused more on the protagonist. Dorothea disappears for long stretches of the narrative. I recommend reading it slowly, and it is structured in short chapters that make this easy to do. By the end, everything gels. I ended up enjoying it much more than expected. I am glad I finally got around to reading this classic. "

I am always a little intimidated whenever I dip my toes into one of the classics, but it's often surprising how readable and enveloping the stories turn out to be. George Eliot is deliberate in her prose and perceptive in her portrayal of the human psyche. There was a mini speech toward the end that about had me in tears (This is a big deal, books do not make me cry! One of Marilynne Robinson's novels is the only one so far!) with its magnifying glass on my own self. Just one of those powerful moments of searing clarity, laid in front of you in the form of characters you know and in whose relationships you now find yourself invested in.A re-read would do wonders to soak up all those bits initially missed, but just as powerful a first read. The audio performance by Juliet Stevenson was tremendous."

I'll have to write something more profound later, but for now, I'll say this. Eliot is a master of embedding prose with philosophy, and she also inspires a lot of pathos for the arcs of her characters despite the walls of words she decorates them in. Eliot was also a master of structure before English artists were so formally thinking about it; Middlemarch is literally like an onion waiting to be peeled. But, I have others things to write, and other things to elucidate on. For now, let me just say that a lot of my ideas on how to write were inspired by Middlemarch, and I'll always be grateful for that."

Küçük bir kasaba ve sakinleri üzerinden aslında dönemin toplumsal panoramasını sunuyor. Zira bu küçük topluluğun içinde; toprak sahipleri, çiftçiler, işçiler, rahipler, doktorlar ve kadınlar var. Evet kadınlar ayrı bir zümre gibi çünkü dönemin erkeklerine göre, “eril” dünyevi uğraşların yani sanatın, bilimin, edebiyatın özetle zeka gerektiren her türlü uğraşın dışında bırakılmış durumdalar. Zaten bir erkek mahlasıyla yazılmış olsa da özünde kadının toplumsal statüsünü, evliliğin amacını, kadınlara yeterli görülen eğitim seviyesini muazzam bir şekilde eleştiriyor. Bunu da dönemin yazarlarında keskin bir şekilde ayrılan ironik ve eğlenceli bir dil tercihiyle yapıyor. Benim gibi klasiklerle mesafeli bir insana dahi büyük bir keyif vermesinin sebeplerinden birisi de bu zaten. Eliot’un çok canlı ve dinamik bir anlatım tarzı var. Bütün karakterler ve Middlemarch coğrafyası oldukça net bir şekilde gözünüzde canlanabiliyor.Kitabı özel yapan yalnızca yazarın üslubu ve öncü feminist metinlerden birisi olması değil tabii ki. Aynı zamanda dönemin siyasi ortamına, reform yasasına, din ve siyasetin karmaşasına dair söyleyeceklerini de bir taşra kasabasının gündelik hayatına çok iyi bir şekilde yedirmiş durumda. Gündelik hayat ise her ne kadar günümüzden bakıldığında oldukça karmaşık görünse de aslında kitapta oldukça gerçekçi bir şekilde aktarılıyor. Zaman zaman sinir bozsa da karakterlerin verdikleri tepkiler, düşünceleri ya da beklentileri insan davranışının çok doğal bir yansıması durumunda. Zaten yazarın kitabın sonuna dair tercihi de bu gerçekliğe verdiği önemin en net göstergelerinden birisi.Açıkcası gerek sayfa sayısı gerekse Kazım Taşkent serisinin kayıt ağırlığı açısından yorucu bir okumaydı ama birlikte geçirdiğimiz 13 güne değdi. Klasiklerle arası olmayan bir insanın dahi büyük bir keyifle okuyabileceği o nadir romanlardan birisiydi. "
137,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52123967-j-c,Rating 5 out of 5,"“Middlemarch” is a masterpiece of wisdom, wit and observation. My edition is 866 pages long, so be prepared to live with it for a while! It is at once a social satire and a social acclamation, of the lives and aspirations of the inhabitants of a small English community in 1832, in a time of parliamentary and social reform. It starts slowly, but it is worth persevering with it. I soon got caught up in the lively interaction between the different personalities in Middlemarch and especially loved the dialogues, which I thought were perfect, cleverly worked out and beautifully expressed. People really argue! And romance is never smooth . . .I found it a wrench to leave all the characters behind at the end. George Eliot herself (she published under a man’s name), recognised this, in a welcome finale: “Every limit is a beginning as well as an ending. Who can quit young lives after being long in company with them, and not desire to know what befell them in their after-years?”Her characters are fully drawn, and their inclinations and behaviour rooted in the common instincts and behaviour of people in any time or place. When misfortune befalls them Eliot does not cavil at calling them “poor so-and-so” - she is wonderfully partial. When her characters make mistakes, she is there with them; she cares. For me it is always a mark of a great author if they can make a very virtuous character sympathetic to the reader, and George Eliot achieves this in Dorothea, who seeks only to do good, but is strong-willed, independently-minded, determined and adventurous. I loved this description of her:“No nature could be less suspicious than hers; when she was a child she believed in the gratitude of wasps and the honourable susceptibility of sparrows, and was proportionally indignant when their baseness was made manifest.”Later in the book their uncle is about to reveal some startling news to Dorothea’s sister:“ ‘It must be about Dodo,’ said Celia, who had been used to think of her sister as the dangerous part of the family machinery.”No good-goody figure there, then! There’s a lot of humour in the portrayals of all the characters, and a very entertaining country auction where the auctioneer is trying in an eloquent sales pitch to sell an anonymous painting, “a proof before the letter”.“I’ll bid a pound!” said Mr Powderell, in a tone of resolved emotion, as of a man ready to put himself in the breach. Whether from awe or pity, nobody raised the price on him.”I don’t want to bore everyone with a long review, so I’ll just finish with saying that Eliot’s writing is superb, entertaining, and edifying, with her apposite but gentle satire. The style may be quite dense, and some words have altered in meaning; for instance, “emissary” meant something rather shady, almost a spy! Some of her words or expressions are today unknown; I loved “nullifidian” (a sceptic, explained in the notes). Truly a classic of English literature. It didn’t rend my heart as did her wonderful “Silas Marner”, but after 866 pages I still wanted more!"

Kitabın alt başlığı “Taşra Hayatı Üzerine Bir İnceleme”. G. Eliot’un da tam olarak yaptığı bu, taşranın sosyal, kültürel ekonomik yaşamının romanlaştırılması. Romantik tarzda yazılmış ve 19. yy ilk yarısında geçen bir roman. Kadınların öne çıktığı aşk öyküleri romanın omurgasını oluşturuyor. Ancak sosyal ve tarihi olaylar da çok güzel bir kurguyla derinliğe inmeden romana yedirilmiş, örneğin liberaller ile muhafazakarların çatışması, ekonomik gelişmelerin ülkede kuzey-güney ekseninde sınıfsal farklılıklar yaratması gibi. Ayrıca din ve idealizm üstünden tutuculuğa bir karşı duruş var, hatta edebiyatı, müziği ve sanatın her türünü günah sayan Püritenliğin eleştirisi olarak da kabul edilir Eliot’un bu romanı. Anlatıcı yazarın kendisi, sadece anlatmakla kalmıyor arada yorumlar da yapıyor. George Elliot (Mary Ann Evans) feminist bir yazar bu nedenle yorumları hep kadınların penceresinden yapıyor. Kadınların rollerini, evliliklerini ve ilişkilerini ustalıkla anlatıyor. Uslup ve karakter tahlilleri çok iyi keza betimlemeler de çok başarılı. Yazar ayrıntıları anlatmada, detayları yakalamakta çok başarılı, bu nedenle olayın geçtiği mekan, yaşanılan zaman dilimi, tıp eğitimi ve sağlık sistemi gibi sosyal konular vb birçok konu inci gibi işlendiğinden okuyucu doyurucu bir metin içinde olduğunu hissediyor.

It was a truly rewarding experience for me. I enjoyed the complexity and didn't shy away from the angst generated by a huge cast of self righteous characters. It felt like it was always going somewhere meaningful; never certain or predictably where; and when you get there, you are rewarded with a better understanding of the time period and it's changing society. I am completely in awe of Eliot/Evans portrayal of everyday English country life and the various stratum in it's rural existence. It was a unique and fascinating tale of a large number of seriously flawed people wrestling with their varying degrees of ego and pride. After completing it, I am captivated by the fact that not one person was of wholly good character. Just brilliant! Highly recommend the Audible version. Kate Reading is exceptionally talented."

142,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,Rating 5 out of 5,"‘Middlemarch’ by George Eliot (aka Mary Ann Evans) is deservedly on that list of Classics everyone should read. Although it can be uncharitably described as ‘only’ a domestic fiction, it is more than that. I enjoyed losing myself by becoming a ghostly neighbor observing the members of the three primary families who are the subjects of this book. There was unexpected exciting drama and much anxiety for the characters!I have copied the book blurb because it is accurate:”Taking place in the years leading up to the First Reform Bill of 1832, Middlemarch explores nearly every subject of concern to modern life: art, religion, science, politics, self, society, human relationships. Among her characters are some of the most remarkable portraits in English literature: Dorothea Brooke, the heroine, idealistic but naive; Rosamond Vincy, beautiful and egoistic: Edward Casaubon, the dry-as-dust scholar; Tertius Lydgate, the brilliant but morally-flawed physician; the passionate artist Will Ladislaw; and Fred Vincey and Mary Garth, childhood sweethearts whose charming courtship is one of the many humorous elements in the novel's rich comic vein.”.With the exception of Charles Dickens, most of the 19th-century writers I’ve read do VERY genteel exposés about class injustices and social economic miseries in their books. So, on top, the Classic 19th-century novel is often a domestic drama or dramedy with a lot of romantic fun and interesting characters. But the plots, settings, and the many characters from different classes in the story sneakily bring in underlying economic causes of pain, often from class/money social mismatches, and subsequent parental/community disapproval. Young economically mismatched lovers feel much emotional distress because of the social destruction their love, if made public, would cause to their futures! Older characters are forced into doing immoral acts to save face and community respect, maintaining their class position by means which cause horrible destruction to innocents! A disintegration of many characters occurs, often leading to unintentional cascades of difficulties! I thought ‘Middlemarch’ a social and psychological fictionalized study of country folk who were in the middle- and upper-classes. The characters live under an enforced rigid set of social rules in the 19th century. For a young unmarried daughter or unmarried son in 1872, life was a very emotionally anxious time (as it has always been for youths of all times), but it was even more so if one fell in love with the ‘wrong’ person as defined by 19-century society, i.e., someone who was below or above one’s class, ‘having money’ or not. Older, now respected upper-class, elders of the small community are in dread of any reveals of their past coming to public knowledge. Eliot obliquely slides in many prejudices that were common to country English gentry, such as those held about Jews, Europeans and city people. The overall impression is of a stratified and stifled society, although one with many hidden desires and motivations. Eliot makes sure we see her characters as being alive, that they feel a lot of normal human depths of emotion under their prim and proper exteriors. One young girl character is naive and deeply religious and studious (book smarts), another is a spoiled shallow product of a finishing school. A young man is having difficulty choosing between earning money in a fast and furiously fun way or the slow way of saving earnings from work. Another young man, a doctor, wants to be a scientist of flashy and new medicine; however, he neglects social niceties, and forgets people are more than being a bag of bones and organs to be fixed. He avoids anything to earn money if it means regular dull normal doctoring. A middle-aged gentleman is more fearful of losing his position in society than in heaven, telling himself if he can keep his status he will be able to do more social good for God. Other comfortable middle-age men feel rage if anyone tries to change how they’ve always done business or try any new ideas which will mean learning something new. There are two men who are the wealthiest gentry in the small community, and they weld great power over the others because of their wealth. One of them has relatives who are eagerly waiting for his death, but don’t feel sorry for him, gentle reader. The other wealthy man is a scholar, but he is unable to understand his studies are not useful, even to other scholars, because the world has moved on with newer and better, more erudite, editions with better and more accurate citations, so-to-speak. He is a man in a state of intellectual stasis. However, Middlemarch thinks him a genius.Many 19th-century English authors chose to depict in euphemisms how life was really lived by people during this century. I believe most writers of this period wanted to expose readers to how horrible the class structuring of society harmed or bent everyone, whether they were of the gentry, merchants or of the uneducated lower-classes. Most of these novels demonstrate how immoral many relationships and businesses became because of class restrictions.That said, the writers wanted people to feel entertained by their reading, to actually buy and enjoy the novels - especially those who could afford to buy books which were expensive (or buy the newspapers which printed novels as serials)! Gentle reader, despite these seemingly overused tropes, which may especially be seen as overused by today’s readers, I LOVE these period classics! The description of the plots don’t do justice to the vivid writing (even if complex with digressions and wordiness), the interesting characters, and the entertaining japes and scrapes. The plots are often convoluted and twisty, even those that appear more like our modern domestic genres, seemingly similar to modern cozies written for sensitive chick-lit tastes. (Not so, imho.) Of course the writing can be a challenge! The earlier eras of writers liked to use complete sentences….😁I think I should include the GR biography of George Eliot as it is as fascinating as her novels, imho: “Mary Ann Evans, known by her pen name George Eliot, was an English novelist, poet, journalist, translator and one of the leading writers of the Victorian era. She was born in 1819 at a farmstead in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England, where her father was estate manager. Mary Ann, the youngest child and a favorite of her father's, received a good education for a young woman of her day. Influenced by a favorite governess, she became a religious evangelical as an adolescent. Her first published work was a religious poem. Through a family friend, she was exposed to Charles Hennell's ""An Inquiry into the Origins of Christianity"". Unable to believe, she conscientiously gave up religion and stopped attending church. Her father shunned her, sending the broken-hearted young dependent to live with a sister until she promised to reexamine her feelings. Her intellectual views did not, however, change. She translated Das Leben Jesu, a monumental task, without signing her name to the 1846 work. After her father's death in 1849, Mary Ann traveled, then accepted an unpaid position with The Westminster Review. Despite a heavy workload, she translated The Essence of Christianity, the only book ever published under her real name. That year, the shy, respectable writer scandalized British society by sending notices to friends announcing she had entered a free ""union"" with George Henry Lewes, editor of The Leader, who was unable to divorce his first wife. They lived harmoniously together for the next 24 years, but suffered social ostracism and financial hardship. She became salaried and began writing essays and reviews for The Westminster Review. Renaming herself ""Marian"" in private life and adopting the penname ""George Eliot,"" she began her impressive fiction career, including: Adam Bede (1859), The Mill on the Floss (1860), Silas Marner (1861), Romola (1863), and Middlemarch (1871). Themes included her humanist vision and strong heroines. Her poem, ""O May I Join the Choir Invisible"" expressed her views about non supernatural immortality: ""O may I join the choir invisible/ Of those immortal dead who live again/ In minds made better by their presence. . ."" D. 1880.Her 1872 work Middlemarch has been described by Martin Amis and Julian Barnes as the greatest novel in the English language.“"

There is always the danger of a reader not finding the same things the author found to be interesting as compelling, but that’s not me, this time. This is a fascinating encapsulation of an era, so for historical fiction, I doubt I will ever find something as good. But it’s also thematically complex and has a very intricate plot across many characters. And it is not prescriptive, despite the author inserting herself into the narrative (in a far more successful and engaging way than, say, War & Peace, I might add). Across the characters what becomes clear is that there is no one correct negotiation to happiness or “right” choice. Especially by popular opinion. The rumour mill of Middlemarch is as savage as Twitter, perhaps even more so, since everyone actually cares what society thinks of them. As time goes by, the fortunes fall and rise with each, as they develop and forge themselves into who they will remain—more-or-less—for the rest of their lives. It touches on all manner of their lives and it was always engrossing to me. Elliot was absolutely an erudite study of people. The rendering at every level of the book is nothing short of masterful.As I said, really the only danger is if a reader isn’t interested in this kind of book, or the style of writing, which is descriptive, high in interiority, and verbose, to say the least. Her command of language as an art is well beyond most. I personally enjoy looking up words, especially esoteric antiquated ones. It doesn’t happen all the time, but enough for it to be fun, and not an obvious deployment of a thesaurus, as sometimes these things go. Anyway: Certainly this easily makes it into my all-time-favourites shelf. "

Middlemarch has been called the greatest novel in the English language, and I think it might be my favorite. I don’t recall another that goes into as much depth with as many characters, where we see their trajectory and growth over time the way we usually do for one or two.George Eliot is insightful and intelligent and such a gifted storyteller. The depth of analysis she offers through these character studies—about politics, about science, about society, about marriage and families, sets this work above the rest. Most importantly to me, she provides this analysis with compassion and a generosity toward every character, as if she brought them to life as a loving creator who accepted them, faults and all, teaching readers a little about compassion in the process. “… it is a narrow mind which cannot look at a subject from various points of view.”When I was a child, I remember hating to leave the world of a book when it was done. This one made me feel that way again."

When I was a youngster and chowing through my R.L. Stine and Christopher Pike books and penning my own stories, it was easy to believe I could come up with superior stuff to what I was devouring at the time. But when I hit my late teens and began reading the Lolitas and the Don Quixotes I was gradually overcome with a sense of horror at the thought that I would never, NEVER write anything a fraction as decent. So I thought what was the point? There's enough sub-standard fiction in the world without me adding to it. So I gave up. Likewise for (almost) every decent literary effort I read, dozens of people on Goodreads have written far superior reviews to anything I could come up with.Anyway my point is, I don't review a lot of the books I read on Goodreads. But I had to say a few words upon completion of 'Middlemarch'. Wow. Just wow. Not that my opinions count for much alongside that of Martin Amis and Julian Barnes, but (alongside Lolita) I would have to agree with them in their assertion that 'Middlemarch' is the best novel written in the English language.

On every page I found some well-turned phrase in which to marvel at and often emotion was heightened and attractions formed or suspended upon the formulation of her words, alone.For the characters that featured here, they were a disparate bunch, with their common ground being the place in which they resided - Middlemarch. Their beginnings all differed but they were also brought together in the common light of Eliot's uncloaking of their true selves. 800 pages is a long time in which to get to know someone, and she utilised every one to aid her in this unmasking.The plot was not wholly to my liking. I preferred the sections that focused on the social politics and relations between all present, rather than those that dwelt upon societal politics, at large. It was often hard to separate the two, however, and I understand how necessary both were for the slow-burn brilliance which was this novel."

Which is why I love her books. But I also feel like she's being sort of judgy about these people she knows, which is why I can't LOOOVE her books, you know?

Her full nature, like that river of which Cyrus broke the strength, spent itself in channels which had no great name on the earth. But the effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs. (p. 919)I am going to try to write this now while it's fresh in my mind but I am bleary-eyed from staying up till 4:15 this morning finishing this greatest of all Victorian novels. I feel both perplexed at myself for having waited so long to read it and also pleased that I did, because it was a fresh delight in every imaginable way. I have never seen a movie of it, either, always wanting to be sure I read the book first; so, I'd no idea how things would turn out and was surprised by joy (as Wordsworth first said, and C.S. Lewis later quoted but neither of them, of course, in relation to Middlemarch).I loved this book so much that part of me wants to begin again from the beginning and do it all over. Eliot's delicacy of insight and deftness of expression reminded me greatly of Henry James. I am aware that she proceeded him in birth by twenty-four years but nevertheless their lifetimes did overlap for a few decades. But Eliot's Middlemarch has a quality I've never come across in James, who is one of my favourite writers so I've read quite a lot of his work: humour. James was no doubt showing us many of the same things Eliot does about human nature, and the results are often similar: We see how petty, vain, silly, and hateful many of us are most of the time, but also how very kind, generous, and noble are a few. But Eliot is wickedly funny, while one would not say that of James (and perhaps it would have ill-suited his novels). What I love most about Eliot's Middlemarch is how kind and compassionate she is to even the worst of her characters, so that we can never quite bring ourselves to hate the villains because we see how their morbid terrors lead them to be as they are; and we cannot simply and unquestioningly love the heroes and heroines without noticing that even they have niggling imperfections. This is a joy to read, frankly. I love Dickens, you know, but am forever finding it annoying that his women, especially, are either pure as the driven snow or worthy only of mockery. Eliot avoids any hint of caricature-making, and offers us her cast of characters in the fullness of their faulty humanity. I am especially grateful to Eliot for Dorothea's surviving with her integrity intact and her great love fulfilled. I enjoyed so many of these wonderful characters: Mary and Fred, the Farebrother family, Mr. Brooke, and dear Celia, who was such a beautiful contrast to Dorothea. I could not help but think how well Eliot expressed the dynamic between many first and second born sisters: indeed, the second born of any sibling set is almost guaranteed to be the opposite of the first in their expression of tastes, behaviours, and sensibilities. Yet, they will often be quite close and love each other dearly, despite or because of these differences. Celia's doting on her baby and expecting ""Dodo"" to be happy doing the same were some of the most amusing passages in the novel.Here are some of my favourite lines, some for their descriptive beauty, some for their shining humanity, and some for their poignant insights. There were many, many more that I might have chosen:It was another or rather a fuller sort of companionship that poor Dorothea was hungering for, and the hunger had grown from the perpetual effort demanded by her married life. She was always trying to be what her husband wished, and never able to repose on his delight in what she was. The thing that she liked, that she spontaneously cared to have, seemed to be always excluded from her life; for if it was only granted and not shared by her husband, it might as well have been denied. (p.522)The memory has as many moods as the temper, and shifts its scenery like a diorama. (p. 574)Lydgate turned, remembering where he was, and saw Dorothea's face looking up at him with a sweet, trustful gravity. The presence of a noble nature, generous in its wishes, ardent in its charity, changes the lights for us: we begin to see things again in their larger, quieter masses, and to believe that we too can be seen and judged in the wholeness of our character. That influence was beginning to act on Lydgate, who had for many days been seeing all life as one who is dragged and struggling amid the throng. (pps. 836-837)Far off in the bending sky was the pearly light; and she felt the largeness of the world and the manifold wakings of men to labour and endurance. She was a part of that involuntary, palpitating life, and could neither look out on it from her luxurious shelter as a mere spectator, nor hide her eyes in selfish complaining. (p. 866)There was evidently some mental separation, some barrier to complete confidence which had arisen between his wife and the husband who had yet made her happiness a law to him. That was a trouble which no third person must directly touch. (p. 849)Until that wretched yesterday . . . all their vision, all their thought of each other, had been as in a world apart, where the sunshine fell on tall white lilies, where no evil lurked, and no other soul entered. But now ― would Dorothea meet him in that world again? (p. 883)That was wrong of you to say, that you would have had nothing to try for. If we had lost our own chief good, other people's good would remain, and that is worth trying for. Some can be happy. I seemed to see that more clearly than ever, when I was most wretched. I can hardly think how I could have borne the trouble, if that feeling had not come to me to make strength. (p. 889)Dorothea sat down on the seat nearest to her, a long low ottoman in the middle of the room, and with her hands folded over each other in her lap, looked at the drear outer world. Will stood still and instant looking at her, then seated himself beside her, and laid his hand on hers, which turned itself upward to be clasped. They sat that way without looking at each other, until the rain abated and began to fall in stillness. Each had been full of thoughts which neither of them could utter. (p. 890)Marriage, which has been the bourne of so many narratives, is still a great beginning, as it was to Adam and Eve, who kept their honeymoon in Eden, but had their first little one among the thorns and thistles of the wilderness. It is still the beginning of the home epic ― the gradual conquest or irremediable loss of that complete union which makes the advancing years a climax, and age the harvest of sweet memories in common. (p. 912)They were bound to each other by a love stronger than any impulses which could have marred it. No life would have been possible to Dorothea which was not filled with emotion, and she had now a life filled also with a beneficent activity which she had not the doubtful pains of discovering and marking out for herself. (p. 916)Reflections on Zadie Smith's commentaryOne disappointment for me was the edition I own, which I wish I'd not bought now. It's the Penguin English Library edition but I will look for a better one. One of the reasons I love Penguin Classics is that the Introductions are frequently deeply interesting and informative. I always look forward to reading them but was unhappy to have finished up this marvelous book with such an underwhelming essay. Smith seems to appreciate Eliot well enough, but uses the space offered her to rabbit on about what modern novelist should be doing in Eliot's wake by experimenting with form, etc. In a world awash in postmodern thought, in which we are all pummeled constantly with reminders that there (supposedly) is no external standard for truth, beauty, or justice, I find it rich when the same people who would voice such opinions then tell us what we should like, approve of, do, feel, or think. I've never cared for Smith's writing, having read a few of her stories and essays. I don't understand her popularity except to say that tastes vary a great deal and, while she is unappealing to mine, clearly others enjoy what she has to offer. Here's an example paragraph from her discussion, which I dislike in its entirety: Any writer of the classic nineteenth-century English novel had to be able to access this organic relation between what one felt one knew of human behaviour and what one knew one felt. That nineteenth-century English novels continue to be written today with troubling frequency is a tribute to the strength of Eliot's example and to the nostalgia we feel for that noble form. Eliot would be proud. But should we be? Where is our fiction? We glimpse it here and there. Certainly not as often as you might expect, given the times we live in. As writers and readers and critics, we English remain terribly proud of our conservative tastes. Every year the polls tell us Middlemarch is the country's favourite novel, followed by Pride and Prejudice, and Jane Eyre (sometimes this order is reversed). Oh, the universality of the themes. Oh, the timelessness of the prose. But there is a misunderstanding, in England, about the words universality and timelessness as they relate to our canon. What is universal and timeless in literature is need―we continue to need novelists who seem to know and feel, and who move between these two modes of operation with wondrous fluidity. What is not universal or timeless, though, is form. Forms, styles, structures―whatever word you prefer―should change like skirt lengths. . . . I disagree with every assumption she makes in the above quote. Firstly, I disagree that there is anything at all troubling about our continuing to write 19-century novels, though I would argue that it is not actually possible to write one, any more than it is possible to write a medieval novel, since we can only ever inhabit our own time; nevertheless, we can certainly use the style and write about the people and events of those times. Secondly, I disagree that we should be concerned about whether or not Smith believes we ""should"" be ""proud"" about the ""nostalgia"" we feel for that ""noble form"" of the 19th-century novel. Frankly, I find her statement and the assumptions behind it condescending. Postmodernists always have the most damnable time allowing other people their own uncensored, unedited responses, and are forever telling everyone else that we should adjust our lenses more to their own liking. I find it boorish and hypocritical and blind: i.e. There are no universal standards of value; nevertheless, mine are the only correct ones.I disagree that there is anything at all wrong with the English repeatedly choosing Middlemarch, Jane Eyre, and Pride and Prejudice as their favourite books over what one assumes Smith considers more deserving and less ""conservative"" choices . . . such as, oh, say, White Teeth? One might think she would comment on the wonder that these ""conservative"" choices are all written by women and that they are all masterpieces and that not one of them would have been considered conservative in its time (which she does point out about Middlemarch but then goes on to chide us for not moving ahead anyway). She seems to mock readers with her sentences ""Oh, the universality of the themes. Oh, the timelessness of the prose."" Well, guess what? The themes are universal and the prose is not only timeless but beautiful and elegant. I agree with her next sentence (and only that one) that we continue to need writers who both think and feel and can move easily between these states, though that seems so obvious that it hardly needs stating, but I disagree that this ""need"" alone is what makes great literature universal and timeless. Smith is here to straighten us out regarding our decades-long ""misapprehension about the words timeless and universal as they relate to our canon"". She presumes to tell us that what we've thought we needed and wanted from literature is not, in fact, what we need and want; that the heart of our needs can be met merely by having writers who think and feel with ""wondrous fluidity"" while ""forms, styles, and structures should change like skirt lengths."" Oh, really? There are trends and there are classics. What makes something a classic is that it stands the endurance test of time. That is why you might still have your set of pearls given you by your parents for your birthday, or your simple black cocktail dress, but probably would have to rifle through old storage to locate your gaucho pants and mood rings. And remember how long it took to grow out that asymmetrical haircut you got back in the eighties, which involved shaving part of your head? The classics have more than earned their keep, and I believe that the current writers who write with the kind of grace and clarity of Bronte, Austen, or Eliot needn't worry about passing tastes, or writers like Smith.Lastly, regarding this: Where is our fiction? We glimpse it here and there. Certainly not as often as you might expect, given the times we live in. Well, Smith surely has not been using Goodreads, has she? Modernists and postmodernists are all the rage these days and they are everywhere. The market is heavy with them, as are the bargain bins and, eventually, the recycle bins. There are many modern and postmodern authors whose work I love but what I certainly do not love is the assumption that this is the only type of thing that should be on offer or that it is in any way superior to what came before it. I especially regret Smith's comment and its implications where she writes about there being too little of ""our"" fiction given ""the times we live in."" I infer from this that she is saying that writers are shirking a duty to cover particular aspects of ""the times we live in."" I dislike artists and writers being told what they should say with their art. I especially dislike their being expected to push a particular set of sociopolitical agendas in their work, so that our books and paintings are reduced to mere vehicles for propaganda. A great writer or painter transcends such things by being . . . yes, I'm going to say it again . . . timeless and universal; so that, while she may include in her books the sociopolitical struggles of her time, as Eliot certainly does in Middlemarch, she achieves her effect by focusing on the lives of her characters and how they are affected by these events as they unfold, rather than hitting us over the head with her own beliefs. After reading Middlemarch, I know only that Eliot had a great mind and heart for writing about characters who cared deeply about their fellow humans. I don't know how she might have voted, where she given the chance, nor do I care."
154,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14941179-anna,Rating 5 out of 5,"After reading a magisterial work of non-fiction recently, Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945, it was time to tackle a magisterial novel. ‘Middlemarch’ took me a while to read because, in addition to its length, I found its effects quite profound. I hadn’t read anything else by Eliot, so had not experienced her gentle yet pitilessly observant perspective. Her writing is truly extraordinary. I found myself reading sections in the narrator’s voice slowly, to appreciate their intelligence, and re-reading certain parts to fully comprehend and enjoy them. It’s rare for me to do that with a novel. Eliot achieves an amazingly fine balance between consideration of the specific nature of rural English life in the 1830s and the timeless dilemmas of being a person. Her characters are both recognisably embedded in their circumstances of life and periodically familiar from life today. The challenges faced by her cast in dealing with their families, with money matters, with careers, and with romantic life, are so vividly drawn as to potentially encourage uncomfortable self-examination. For example:We are on a perilous margin when we begin to look passively at our future selves, and see our own figures led with dull consent into insipid misdoing and shabby achievement. Poor Lydgate was inwardly groaning on that margin, and Will was arriving at it.At every turn, the reader comes across comments of great wisdom, carelessly sprinkled amid a compelling plot. I was particularly arrested by this quote, penned by the author, at the heading of chapter 53:It is but a shallow haste which concludeth insincerity from what outsiders call inconsistency - putting a dead mechanism of ‘ifs’ and ‘therefores’ for the living myriad of hidden suckers whereby the belief and the conduct are wrought into mutual sustainment. In retrospect, I wish I had taken note of particularly notable phrases more often. I was perhaps too swept away by the sympathetic yet slightly distant observation of the characters. And what a fascinating group they were. I was inevitably drawn to Dorothea, with her frustrated wish to study the world and improve it. She is no paragon, despite her constant plans for doing good, and her choices often cause problems for herself and others. Due to lack of formal learning and exposure to the world, her intelligence is repeatedly shown to be wasted and blunted by naivety, because she is a woman. The depiction of gender roles is very striking throughout. There are subtle and blatant differences to be seen in the women of Middlemarch, despite the fact that all male characters are shown to consider them lesser. Mrs. Cadwallader proved to be my favourite secondary character, as the most plain-speaking person in the book. Mr. Brooke’s attempts to patronise her inevitably end in his own embarrassment. In ‘Middlemarch’ Eliot displays all of Jane Austen’s incisive observation, sharp wit, and adept plotting. Yet there is something more besides: ‘Middlemarch’ is more raw and visceral than what I’ve read of Austen. The unhappy marriages are truly upsetting to read about, especially that of Lydgate to Rosamond as it is tangled with the horror of debt. When Fred’s inability to handle money is damaging to his closest friends, that is bad enough. But the corrosive effects of money worries on Lydgate are perhaps the strongest depiction of debt I’ve ever read. Eliot manages, somehow, to chop the reader’s sympathy into fine slices, divided between husband and wife at various points. I was initially inclined to consider Rosamond unbearable in her selfish, impractical, and profligate ways. Then it became clearer that she is trapped in a bleak marriage to a man she no longer likes, let alone loves, and the only power she can exert is to make him miserable. Lydgate is, in his own way, equally unrealistic and clearly never respected his wife as a person. The fact that divorce is not an available option makes this all deeply tragic. I don’t recall Austen getting so deeply into the undignified details of debt. Her seemingly unsuited couples always have some comic detail, while there is nothing funny at all about Lydgate and Rosamond. Eliot’s pathos never descends into melodrama, even when a tumultuous emotional conversation takes place during a storm. One thing Austen and Eliot emphatically share is a brilliant ear for dialogue. Dorothea’s conversation with Rosamond is one of the book’s most memorable and intense scenes, while Mrs. Cadwallader’s comments form the most hilarious moments. The finale chapter could have sounded a pompous note in the hands of a lesser writer. As it stands, the final paragraphs are thought-provoking and startlingly relevant. While hardly encouraging per se, they convey something important that is quite difficult to express:For there is no creature whose inward being is so strong that it is not greatly determined by what lies outside it. A new Theresa will hardly have the opportunity of reforming a conventional life, any more than a new Antigone will spend her heroic piety in daring all for the sake of a brother’s burial: the medium in which their ardent deeds took place is for ever gone. But we insignificant people with our daily words and acts are preparing the lives of many Dorotheas, some of which may present a far sadder sacrifice than that of the Dorothea whose story we know.‘Middlemarch’ requires an investment of time and attention, which is rewarded with an unusual richness of deeply humane observation and insight. What a wonderful novel."

“selfless”

Just like Romola, the heroine of another book by George Eliot that I loved, your strength of character and your ability to discern and appreciate what is correct in a world where shallowness is reigning, are some of your most important qualities. The depth of your emotions and of your desire to help others made me admire you so. I wonder if your character (and Romola’s) mirror Eliot’s personality.In a time when one’s choice in spouses is made for life, unless death interferes, what is one to do when he realizes that the person he has chosen to spend his life with is not what he thought that person would be? Because the courting period is too short or based on short episodes of experiencing things together, can it really permit one to make acquaintance with the personality of his soon to be spouse or is imagination helping to fill in the blanks? What does one do if during this period he only projected his mental image of desired qualities and traits in a person onto the persona of the individual he is uniting his destiny with and he realizes only after he has done this binding step that the person he is with is a total stranger? Dorothea and Lydgate experience this drama with their spouses. What are strong noble characters like them to do when confronted with the real versions of their spouses, not the ones embellished by their imaginations?
“The fact is unalterable, that a fellow-mortal with whose nature you are acquainted solely through the brief entrances and exits of a few imaginative weeks called courtship, may, when seen in the continuity of married companionship, be disclosed as something better or worse than what you have preconceived, but will certainly not appear altogether the same.”
 Characters like Fred (who seems a very nice and fair fellow, but somehow lost because he doesn’t know what career to pursue and his means don’t permit him to act against the will of his parents and society), Will Ladislaw (who has the most noble of characters), Mary Garth (who is really wise and interesting, normal-looking, but not what is perceived as beautiful in those times) or the Garths in general are not well seen by others, while Rosy who is a shallow, spoiled girl is very well regarded. Society of those times has a peculiar way of filtering what is good and bad only based on money, name and not nobility of intentions and of character.This book is about choices and how we have to live with the choices we make. This book is about longing for the dear ones, about love and marriage and it excels in portraying various types of people: people like Lydgate (strong, correct beyond belief, with a strong desire to make a change in the world through his knowledge and willing to work very hard for developing new methods of treatment), people like Mary Garth (humble, but with a great character, witty, humorous and very faithful to the ones she loves), people like Rosamond (shallow, believing herself to be the center of the Universe and thinking that her beauty makes it her right to consider all men subdued by her, silly and stubborn), Casaubon (selfish, vain, malicious, jealous and lacking sympathy of others) and so on. This book is about life, life in another century, and although the times are different from the present ones, the themes are of great actuality.I am so glad to have picked this book now! I think for me it was exactly the right moment when I could read it so as to be able to fully appreciate its meanings. George Eliot, you genius!"

O ritmo do livro é lento, compassado, que ajuda a sermos transportados para esse cenário bucólico de época, em que tudo tem o seu tempo para acontecer.São muitos os personagens desta história, bem construídos e interessantes. Um enredo também ele bastante bom, que permitiu a George Eliot traçar um retrato fiel da sociedade da época georgiana (periodo que antecedeu a época victoriana), ""chamando a atenção"" para vários temas. O papel da mulher, o seu estatuto e o casamento são alguns dos temas principais, mas surgem outros como a religião ( hipocrisia religiosa), a economia, a política, a educação, as diferenças de classes, etc.Dito isto, a época não me interessa particularmente e este género de histórias também não. As duas histórias principais deste longo enredo (existem várias outras paralelas), giram à volta de duas personagens principais (Dorothea e Lydgate) e apesar de serem boas histórias e bons personagens, não me entusiasmaram. Achei também o livro demasiado longo para aquilo que no final acabei por reter dele. Foi sem dúvida uma leitura agradável, mas tépida. E quando um livro não nos transmite emoção...enfim, fica a faltar quase tudo.Em comparação com o livro ""O Moinho à Beira do Rio"" da mesma autora, achei este inferior. Assim, apesar de não vos dizer para se afastarem de Middlemarch porque é sem dúvida uma boa leitura e um bom livro, a aconselhar um livro de George Eliot, aconselharia antes esse.nota: uma recente leitura (Jane Eyre de Charlotte Brontë) faz-me doravante desaconselhar as edições ""Romano Torres"". São edições das quais gostava bastante, mas tendo comparado a versão original do inglês de Jane Eyre e a edição da Romano Torres, fiquei bastante desiludida e até um pouco incrédula com as ""liberdades"" de tradução que encontrei. Pessoalmente, irei evitar estas edições. Estou até desconfiada que esta minha leitura de Middlemarch poderá ter sido ""contaminada"" pela edição que escolhi para ler.

The only thing I can say, as a casual reader, is whether, aside from its acknowledged greatness, it's any fun to read. In other words, is this a book which you have to have three PhDs in English lit to appreciate? No, it isn't. While the Victorian style of writing is a matter of taste, and I can see why it would exasperate some modern readers, it's in fact a joy to read. For a hefty tome it takes barely any time at all to get through, and as the lives of the many characters and their businesses, secrets, desires, mistakes, pasts and ambitions mingle and interfere with each other, you become more and more involved to the point where, by the end, you can't wait to find out how it all ends.

Furono i risultato complesso di un impulso giovane e nobile che lottava tra i condizionamenti di una situazione sociale imperfetta in cui i grandi sentimenti assumono spesso l’aspetto dell’errore e la fede profonda l’aspetto di un’illusione. Perché non c’è creatura il cui essere interiore sia così forte da non essere in gran parte determinato da ciò che gli sta attorno. Difficile che una nuova Teresa possa avere l’occasione di riformare la vita conventuale, non più di quanto una nuova Antigone potrà impiegare la sua pietà eroica sfidando tutti per la sepoltura di un fratello: il medium attraverso il quale le loro ardenti azioni prendevano forma se n’è andato per sempre. Ma noi creature insignificanti, con le nostre parole e le nostre azioni quotidiane, prepariamo le vite di molte Dorothee, in alcune delle quali potrebbero presentarsi dei sacrifici ben più tristi di quello della Dorothea di cui conosciamo la storia.Il suo animo nobile continuò a proiettare i suoi nobili raggi, sebbene essi non fossero distintamente visibili. La sua natura traboccante, come quel fiume di cui Ciro indebolì la forza, si riversò in canali che non ebbero grandi nomi sulla terra. Ma l’influsso della sua esistenza su quelli che le stavano attorno fu incalcolabilmente ampio: perché il bene avvenire del mondo dipende in parte da azioni di portata non storica; e se le cose, per voi e per me, non vanno così male come sarebbe stato possibile, lo dobbiamo in parte a tutti quelli che vissero con fede una vita nascosta e riposano in tombe che nessuno visita.Immenso."

I felt rushed by the deadlines of my own life while reading, and didn't allow myself to bask in the narrative. I also (silly as it is) began to feel really insecure while reading the numerous descriptions of Rosamond's beauty. Yes, yes, I know that she's silly and blah blah blah.

164,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/85543627-justin-pickett,Rating 4 out of 5,"Exceedingly cerebral, yet scarcely affecting, Middlemarch is insightful and filled with discerning quotes, but is not always exciting or enjoyable. There are probably too many characters and too many storylines. The central story juxtaposes the lives and relationships of two very different women, one with the disposition of a nun or saint, who loathes her wealth and cares nothing of status (Dorothea), the other with a narcissistic and passive-aggressive personality, who desires wealth and status, and who is willing to hazard marital and moral ruin for them (Rosamond). Dorothea sees marriage as a chance to do her religious duty while growing intellectually, hoping foremost for a husband who “thinks with me” (p. 23). By contrast, Rosamond, who is “little used to imagining other people’s states of mind except as a material cut into shape by her own wishes” (p. 730), sees marriage as something that should bend to her, entertain her, and promote her personal interests. The cultural setting that looms throughout the story, and that sets the limits on the societal impact that Dorothea can have, is one dominated by the traditional gender ideology that defines women as inferiors: “Your sex are not thinkers … your sex is capricious, you know” (pp. 51 & 52). The takeaway from the book is that the distinction between Saint Thereasa and a humble and faithful housewife is often their social environment and opportunities: “For there is no creature whose inward being is so strong that it is not greatly determined by what lies outside it” (p. 784). 
Some Memorable Quotes:
“Many Theresas have been born who found for themselves no epic life wherein there was a constant unfolding of far-resonant action … Their ardour alternated between a vague ideal and the common yearning of womanhood, so that one was disapproved as extravagance and the other condemned as a lapse” (p. 3). “It is not a sin to make yourself poor in performing experiments for the good of all” (p. 16). “Women don’t love men for their goodness” (p. 132). “There is hardly any contact more depressing to a young, ardent creature than that of a mind in which years full of knowledge seem to have issued in a blank absence of interest or sympathy” (p. 189). “Art is an old language with a great many artificial, affected styles, and sometimes the chief pleasure one gets out of knowing them is the mere sense of knowing” (p. 197). “Young folks may get fond of each other before they know what life is, and they may think it all holiday if they can only get together; but it soon turns into working day, my dear” (p. 246). “Society never made the preposterous demand that a man should think as much about his own qualifications for making a charming girl happy as he thinks of hers from making himself happy” (p. 267). “To know intense joy without a strongly bodily frame one must have an enthusiastic soul” (p. 267). “It is an uneasy lot at best to be what we call highly taught and yet not to enjoy: to be present at this great spectacle of life and never to be liberated from a small, hungry, shivering self—never to be fully possessed by the glory we behold, never to have our consciousness rapturously transformed into the vividness of a thought, the ardour of a passion, the energy of an action, but always to be scholarly and uninspired, ambitious and timid, scrupulous and dimsighted” (p. 268). “Ther is no general doctrine which is not capable of eating out our morality if unchecked by the deep-seated habit of direct fellow-feeling with individual fellow-men” (p. 581). “For religion can only change when the emotions which fill it are changed, and the religion of personal fear remains nearly at the level of the savage” (p. 582). “I suppose one gets a habit of doing without happiness or hope” (p. 593). “To think of the part one little woman can play in the life of a man, so that to renounce her may be a very good imitation of heroism, and to win her may be a discipline” (p. 636). “The presence of a noble nature, generous in its wishes, ardent in its charity, changes the lights for us: we begin to see things again in their larger, quieter, masses and to believe that we too can be seen and judged in the wholeness of our character” (p. 716). “Even if we loved someone else better than—than those we were married to, it would be no use … I know it may be very dear, but it murders our marriage, and then the marriage stays with us like a murder, and everything else is gone” (p. 748). “That is a rare and blessed lot which some greatest men have not attained, to know ourselves guiltless before a condemning crowd, to be sure that what we are denounced for is solely the good in us” (p. 772). “I should never like scolding anyone else so well, and that is a point to be thought of in a husband” (p. 776). “Husbands are an inferior class of men, who require keeping in order” (p. 777). 1) Story (4/5) 2) Writing (5/5)3) Originality (4/5)4) Characters (5/5)5) Set pieces (3/5)6) Suspense (2/5)7) Ending (5/5)8) Relationships (romantic or otherwise) (5/5)9) Dialogue (5/5)"
165,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33641676-rebecca,Rating 4 out of 5,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading George Eliot's masterpiece of commentary on the human condition, set in early 19th C rural England. She is justly renowned for creating believable characters with empathy and insight and unfolding their lives into stories that enable a thorough exploration of their strengths and weaknesses. I strongly recommend this novel as the recognized outstanding example of 19th C English literature that it is.Eliot is intensely perceptive of complex human character, but I frankly wonder if she couldn't have cut the verbiage down by a third and still been just as observant but more trenchant. In the thick of many of her paragraphs I was forced to painfully deconstruct lengthy sentences and struggle with the meaning of select words and phrases to try and follow her allusions, often unsuccessfully. Perhaps some of this difficulty lies in my modern habituation to quick summary communications and the electronic speed of daily life. Sitting down to a languid daily immersion in the finely-examined subtleties of gentile English 19C life required a detachment from the normal pace that I found challenging.And then frequently, in the midst of what was becoming a bit of a slog, this reader would stumble upon sudden delightful, wry gems such as the following, plucked as a small taste-treat from a whole clump of ironic observations:“To be candid, in Middlemarch phraseology, meant to use an early opportunity of letting your friends know that you did not take a cheerful view of their capacity, their conduct, or their position; and a robust candour never waited to be asked for its opinion.”Utterly delightful!I'll also admit to initially struggling to identify with one of the leading characters, Dorothea, sufficiently to accompany Eliot's stage-setting. It is essential to the plot that Dorothea be believable in her youthful idealization of her future husband's great academic pursuit and her ardor to devote her existence to his work. But she also has to have enough spine of her own to keep the reader interested in what happens to her eventually, and I found this to be such a conflict in her personality that much of her domestic predicament merely grated on me. But perhaps that was the point and Eliot succeeded in convincing me of the genuineness of Dorothea's depiction or, rather than get wrapped-up in throwing punches from the sideline, I would have been neutrally feeling sorry for her.My empathy was much more immediate and intense for another leading character: Tertius Lydgate, a struggling country doctor aspiring to great, progressive contributions to medical science in the face of financial ruin and an unhappy, selfish and duplicitous young wife, Rosamond. Sure, he was silly to let his guard down and get entrapped by her determination to marry a foreigner rather than a ho-hum local boy, but her growing blind disdain for his trials is maddening.Being only a little familiar with Eliot’s works, midway through my reading I was surprised to find that “Middlemarch” is classified, at least by some algorithms, as a romance. Not only is Eliot’s subject matter and treatment so much more than what that one word conveys but the only other Eliot book I had read before was “The Mill on the Floss”, which was anything but. (Frankly, I was steeling myself for some pretty unhappy wrap-ups in “Middlemarch” based on the stark ending I found in “The Mill”.) Perhaps in the all’s-well-that-ends-well vein “Middlemarch” fits the general description of a romance novel, but I would recommend it much more as a serious and valuable exploration of human ambition, disappointment and reconciliation through the mind of an exceptional observer and writer."
166,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43664238-raul,Rating 5 out of 5,"Middlemarch, is a brilliant tale set in an English provincial town within the first half of the 19th century. George Eliot, born Mary Ann Evans, addresses society and the hypocrisies that come with it using well developed characters such as the sharp-tongued Mrs. Cadwaller to the narrow-minded Sir Chettam.Dorothea, the main character of the book, is a beautiful and intelligent young lady whose first marriage to Mr. Causabon falls short of the expectations she had of helping the rather 'dry' scholar as Milton's daughters helped their father aiming to improve her knowledge. Eliot describes the expectations before marriage and the disappointments of the realities after, with all the young married couples in the book. Apart from Dorothea, Mr. Causabon himself is dissatisfied after his marriage as well as Mr. Lydgate the provincial doctor and his wife, Rosamond.Rosamond another main character in the book, a beautiful young woman who had been reared in ways of being a pleasing woman since school, enjoys ensnaring men with her beauty and climbi up the ladders of society. She married her husband (Mr. Lydgate) because she felt by doing so it would propel her higher into society. Rosamond Vincy, in many ways is reminiscent of the character Emma Bovary by Gustave Flaubert. Both characters indebt their families with expenses, both are wives of provincial doctors and both characters have or, in the case of Rosamond, intend to have extra-marital romantic affairs.However, unlike Emma, Rosamond is spared of a fate similar to Emma. It is however very ironic when Rosamond feels Mary Garth shouldn't marry her brother due to their social position being lower than her family's yet she does the same thing with Lydgate.The book is without a doubt an incredible piece of work that highlights on hypocrisies within religion and society while having a beautiful prose and dramatic turns including haunting past secrets and unexpected will arrangements and death affect and shape the characters in the book."

Escolheu usar o pseudónimo de George Eliot para fugir dos estereótipos que diziam que as mulheres só escreviam romances leves.Middlemarch foi inicialmente publicado como um romance/novela, dividido em oito partes que saíam a cada dois meses. Começou com a história de Lydgate e as dificuldades de ser um médico de província, depois passou para a história de Dorothea, e, posteriormente, George Eliot decidiu construir um mundo em torno destas duas personagens, criar o retrato de uma cidade e dos seus habitantes e, paralelamente, analisar tópicos políticos, sociais e económicos através de uma série de episódios que servem para mostrar como as pessoas são afectadas pelas mudanças, e como o progresso influencia as suas vidas. Um retrato da complexidade da vida humana comum: tragédias silenciosas, fracassos de pequenos personagens, pequenos triunfos e momentos tranquilos de dignidade.É um romance invulgar, de proporções épicas mas que modifica a noção de épico. Em Middlemarch não há um herói e grandes aventuras, há a vida provincial de pessoas comuns, vidas e histórias perfeitamente normais.E como ninguém pode representar a vida provincial, é necessário incluir várias pessoas. Assim como o número de personagens (>40*) é enorme, a diversidade de assuntos (>15*) não lhe fica atrás, o que dificulta, numa fase inicial, a leitura, mas à medida que vamos avançando percebemos a complexidade das personagens, as suas contradições e podemos apreciar, ou não, cada um deles de acordo com suas falhas e defeitos pessoais.É uma experiência enriquecedora e memorável.

I read it twice before some thirty plus years ago and reread about half of it within the last five years. This time through though has been the most fun. George Eliot is a hoot: she has nailed pretty much all of the human race in all our loves and losses and petty pride and yet she loves us all. All the characters are fully developed from the earliest sketches of them. (This is a skill Eliot shares with Ibsen, another who can present an entire persona in a few small actions.) All the intricate plot machinations fit together perfectly. While many see Dorothea Brooke and Tertius Lydgate as the main characters, the true protagonist is the village of Middlemarch. Eliot begins with a “prelude” about Saint Theresa: “Theresa’s passionate, ideal nature demanded an epic life.” Eliot goes on to claim that the original saint is hardly the last of that type of woman, that many like her have been born even if they have not managed to live epic lives. Eliot’s Theresa, Dorothea Brooke, is ambitious to live a worthy life; she is not interested in mere marriage and family. Nor does she covet fine things. She would renounce everything to be a great spirit. Her uncle and guardian does not understand why she does not respond favorably to the honorable intentions of the local young landowner or why she insists on giving up every pleasure (like horseback riding) that otherwise appeals to her. Her younger sister Celia, who does not share her sister’s ardor or self-sacrifice, explains: “She likes giving up.” And so she does, as she accepts the marriage proposal of Edward Casaubon, so she might devote herself to serving a great scholar much as Milton’s daughters served their father. Suffice it to say that the marriage does not go forward as she had hoped.Tertius Lydgate is a brash, smart, ambitious doctor who settles in Middlemarch. Unlike his competitors, he does not sell drugs to his patients, refusing to over-prescribe in order to make more money. He keeps up with the latest research and combines with some money forces in town to create a truly great hospital. Of course, he makes a few mistakes here and there, and his great talents do not play out as he had envisioned they would.This is no place to lay out the entire list of characters (they are many, and I found that keeping track on a separate sheet of paper to be very helpful) or the many ins and outs of a truly complex and fascinating series of intricately connected events. One is better off reading the book than anyone’s notes about it. It is, in fact, all those interconnections between characters, events, and places, the great web of society, that is the true subject of this great novel. And Eliot is a brilliant writer, using every word, every name, every sentence to build her monumental story. Read and marvel."

There was a quotation, greek or roman mythology or biblical allusion, or pop culture reference (of the time) in every paragraph. I'm not kidding. Also totally derivative: Dickensian in plotting (deux ex machina galore) but without his momentum; imitative in structure and attempting the class analysis of War & Peace but nowhere near achieving the latter's historical depth of analysis; trying for Jane Austen's social commentary but without her sense of humor or subtlety (the narrator blatantly and arrogantly tells the reader what to think, sometimes unaware of psychological or even logical inconsistencies into which she's forcing her characters for the sake of moralizing). Definitely suffering from the typical pitfalls of the serialized form in which it was originally written. However, there were a lot of quotable lines and home truths scattered among it's many, many unnecessary and overwrought pages. And her dialog was very, very realistic. Wish there could have been more dialog and far, far less exposition! A good editor would have made a masterpiece out of this mess.A shame that a such a brilliant, brave and interesting woman as George Elliot, who led such an unconventional and fascinating life, couldn't distill all that experience more artfully into her writing. No wonder I'd heard of her, but I'd never heard of any of her books."

Every novel or album or painting I love, I love in part because it's manifestly itself: Van Gogh is great largely because he's the only Van Gogh—that is, he does something no one else does—and if he's the only one what's the point in comparing him with Bruegel? And yet... well, it's hard to read Middlemarch without feeling you're encountering something elevated, something set apart, something which deserves (but, in its modesty, does not demand) to be placed on a tier of its own.And why is that, exactly? Oh, I wish you wouldn't ask. I always hate this part, trying to encapsulate and explain what's so brilliant about a brilliant book. A good book is generally pretty easy to sum up: here's all the stuff I liked, here's one or two things that could use improvement, and we're done. A just-okay book is even easier, 'cause the whole time you were reading it you were probably thinking of all the parts you wish had been better. And a bad book? Well, there's nothing easier than a hatchet job.A great book though, ugh. What could there possibly be to say? And really, is there even any point in saying it?It's cliché to claim that a big, expansive, typically European classic like this is about nothing short of ""life itself""—I know because I've done it more than once—so I'll resist the temptation this time around. Eliot's is in fact a very specific milieu, and, in that paradoxical way true of all successful fiction, it's the specificity itself which gives the book whatever greater universality it may possess. After all, I didn't connect with this book because Eliot showed me the whole broad swathe of humankind in one massive sweep; I connected with it because, even separated by many thousands of miles and well over a century from both its subject and its author, I felt as if she was showing me myself and the people I've been surrounded by all my life.
Certainly those determining acts of her life were not ideally beautiful. They were the mixed result of young and noble impulse struggling amidst the conditions of an imperfect social state, in which great feelings will often take the aspect of error, and great faith the aspect of illusion. For there is no creature whose inward being is so strong that it is not greatly determined by what lies outside it.
Eliot's original subtitle was ""A Study of Provincial Life,"" and there are two very telling pieces of information to be found in those five words. For one, this is a provincial (that is, ""country"" or ""small town,"" if you're an American like me) novel. This isn't just a book about the things human beings do, it's a book about the things human beings do within small, self-isolated communities, cut off from the metropolis and the newer, more fashionable cultural currents which in hindsight will come to be regarded as the ""spirit of the age."" You and I live in an era of rapid urbanization, a pushing-together of human lives made all the more total, for better and worse, by the constant connectivity of the internet. (This is why I could tell you more about New York, a city I've never set foot in, than I could most of the suburbs ten minutes outside the city in which I live.) But that's a fairly new development in human history, and small-town life has always had a particular dynamic and set of rules all its own. 
For the first time Lydgate was feeling the hampering threadlike pressure of small social conditions, and their frustrating complexity.
For all the seclusion country living may seem to offer, there's no such thing as solitude when everyone you meet knows your name and personal history and probably grew up with you too. From the beginning lives start to be knotted and double-knotted together, and that dense net of affections and obligations and rivalries very quickly becomes impossible to disentangle yourself from—save perhaps by running away altogether, though even then our past lives have a way of finding and returning to us. (Just ask Middlemarch's own Mr. Bulstrode.) I grew up in such an environment myself, and Eliot's is a more accurate and thorough portrayal of that kind of social web than any other I've ever read. But of course—and here we see the specific becoming the universal—that's also kinda just life itself. We all have families of some kind, networks of friends and lovers and ex-lovers and work colleagues and maybe a few folks we consider our enemies, and whether we want to or not we can't simply wriggle out of these connections when it suits us. Human beings are bound intractably to one another, and it's near impossible to tell at the outset whether our particular bonds will do more to help or hinder us in the long run.
Who can know how much of his most inward life is made up of the thoughts he believes other men to have about him, until that fabric of opinion is threatened with ruin?
The other useful piece of that subtitle I mentioned earlier is the phrase ""a study."" Middlemarch introduces us to several scholars, amateur and otherwise, and, strange though it may seem to frame a work of fiction in such terms, the novel itself is presented to us as a sort of sociological experiment. What if, Eliot asks us in her prologue, St. Teresa of Ávila had been born today? Would the bounds and restrictions of modern society even allow for a great moral hero like the ones of old to emerge and find a worthy purpose, or would such a soul be destined now for obscurity? She gives us two young test subjects, Dorothea Brooke and Tertius Lydgate, the one consumed by dreams of saintly glory and the other of scientific fame; and then she drops them into the world and allows us to observe for ourselves all the many and varied obstacles which keep them from their hearts' desires. Along the way we meet plenty of others with dreams and dilemmas of their own, but always the fundamental questions are the same: is it possible today to live as a truly ""good person""? And if so, how?
There is no general doctrine which is not capable of eating out our morality if unchecked by the deep-seated habit of direct fellow feeling with individual fellow-men.
Of course a novelist is in some ways the opposite of a scientist—the results of the experiment are always ultimately hers to decide—and Eliot could just as easily have granted her characters success as failure had she wanted to. (And really, it's a testament to her profound craftsmanship and knack for convincing scene-setting that a book which so often hinges on almost melodramatic contrivances never strains our willing suspension of disbelief.) But nevertheless, the questions she raises and the answers she provides are legitimate ones. Most of us earnestly desire to be good people and to do great things, and most of us fail on at least one of these counts. Perhaps even harder to face is the realization that we can do great good in one area and great harm in another, appear to some people as a shining example and to others a source of deep pain. No noble impulse or petty motivation, no tiny act of kindness or great act of cruelty is written off by Eliot as irrelevant or uninteresting, and as a result there's hardly a single character in whom the reader (or at least this particular reader) will not see some reflection of their own life and struggles.
It had seemed to him as if they were like two creatures slowly turning to marble in each other's presence, while their hearts were conscious and their eyes were yearning.
It's that level of psychological penetration, I think, which truly launches this book into the upper echelons. This is an extraordinarily interior novel—the action happens almost entirely within the characters themselves—and nearly every page is rich with insight, little observations which are rooted (once again) in the specific experiences of these specific people but unfold into more universal truths. Marriage, family, gender politics, regular politics, religion, money, addiction, love—all of this and much more Eliot examines and dissects, and her conclusions didn't once strike me as false or far-fetched. Zadie Smith comments in one of her essays that only inexperienced writers are axiomatic, embedding little morals and lessons in the text, but Eliot is the exception which proves the rule: in her authorly omniscience she's constantly pronouncing this or that about human nature, but somehow she never becomes reductive, never makes us feel like she's forcing us to a conclusion about the characters and their problems. Her approach is one of profound sympathy, and for all the abuse her creations suffer she never seems to take any pleasure (well, not much) in their pain.
Some gentlemen have made an amazing figure in literature by discontent with the universe as a trap of dulness into which their great souls have fallen by mistake; but the sense of a stupendous self and an insignificant world may have its consolations. Lydgate's discontent was much harder to bear: it was the sense that there was a grand existence in thought and effective action lying around him, while his self was being narrowed into the miserable isolation of egoistic fears, and vulgar anxieties for events that might allay such fears.
That's the gist of it, I guess, and about as much as I can reasonably expect anyone to read, although there's much, much more to be said. (This is the particular cruelty of Goodreads: to be expected to digest a book like this one in the space of a few meager paragraphs.) I want to tell you more about the characters, complicated and frustrating and lovely, who all seemed somehow to contain a piece of my own soul. I want to tell you about Eliot's elaborate but unpretentious sentences, and her earthy and surprising metaphors, and her abundance of literary and historical and scientific allusions. I want to dig deeper into her conclusions about goodness and greatness, and to hash out my own feelings on each, and to talk about how, for all her realism, our author never fully succumbs to pessimism or hopelessness. 
But scepticism, as we know, can never be thoroughly applied, else life would come to a standstill: something we must believe in and do, and whatever that something may be called, it is virtually our own judgment, even when it seems like the most slavish reliance on another.
So maybe somewhere down the line you and I can meet, in a dim country tavern or beside a stone boundary wall somewhere on the road from one little village to the next, and talk Middlemarch through like it deserves. For now, though, I'm relieved to have managed any words at all about this new favorite-among-favorites, and consider myself privileged to have found myself ensnared in such a beautifully intricate spiderweb of words and lives."

At times the characters come to life in such a starling way that I forgot I was even reading. That rare transcendence that happens with a perfect novel. All the many loose threads come together in the end in this big ol tapestry, in my humble onion. In short I loved this novel and will add it to my books to re-read every five years or so to see how I’ve changed. Some people say this is the best novel ever written in the English language, well, maybe. It depends on how much time you got and how much love you got. I can say this—it sticks the landing. Whatever you put into this novel you’re going to get out of it. Elliot is a genius, a master, a romantic, maybe not as funny as Dostoevsky or as reaching for the stars as Tolstoy, but shit, nobody has better characters or capacity for plot or a town of shit talking gossips. Anyways, yes, one of the best doorstop novels I’ve ever read, whatever that’s worth. Read this and then Anna Karenina or that and then this someday. Life will seem bigger than life which is what novels are for, baby."
177,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35841298-mahima,Rating 5 out of 5,"When I first read Middlemarch some two years ago I remember being astounded by the complexity as well as coherence of its structural pattern which like a web lies underneath the novel’s many points of narrative interests. I saw that even more clearly in this reading. What changed, however, was my relationship with the characters of the novel. Whereas the last time I saw only surface details and was too hasty in forming judgements, something that in fact Eliot time and again advises against in the novel, this time I engaged more deeply with them, recognising a complete psychological portrait in each character, none of whom were exempt from flaws. Apropos to the various scientific metaphors in the novel and to the role of historian/sociologist that the narrator takes on, Eliot puts all her characters under a microscopic gaze that is the narrator’s penetrating insight into them which is often bitingly ironic. The idea is to show the various beliefs that govern each character and then mystify these beliefs as illusions and show them to be fundamental errors. So Dorothea mistakes Casaubon as a guide who would help her fulfill some ideal end, so Rosamond spins a “gossamer web” of love, not seeing fantasy for what it is, so Lydgate thinks he can separate himself from social forces and succeed in his professional as well as personal life, so Casaubon keeps wandering endlessly among labyrinthine ancient myths without realising that his thesis might no longer have any standing, so Fred Vincy believes that as an agreeable young gentleman luck will always be on his side, and so Bulstrode justifies his faults to himself by taking worldly success as a sign of God’s forgiveness. Just as their beliefs are mistaken, so are the characters’ specific readings of each other. Misinterpretation is a good way of characterising the relationships between men and women in the novel who see each other not as individuals but ideals rendered through a distorted lens of social, gendered expectations and who are stuck each in his or her own little world with no real access to the other’s world. Eliot exposes her characters’ shortcomings and short-sightedness both to make us understand their actions and to elicit compassion from us even if it is accompanied by criticism. After all, “We are all of us born in moral stupidity . . .” and it is the job of the artist to extend “our contact with our fellow-men beyond the bounds of our personal lot.”Eliot ends the novel with a few words on the importance of “unhistoric acts” on “the growing good of the world” and this provides a good idea of some of the ideological concerns of the novel. On the one hand, it points to the stand Eliot seems to be taking on social and political reform. Situated right before the passing of the First Reform Bill of 1832 and written around the time of the Second Reform Bill of 1867, the novel depicts throughout the glacially slow nature of such reform which by the time of the novel’s composition still hadn’t enfranchined a large majority of people, including women. Eliot seems to be privileging microprocesses of change over legislative reform. But, on the other hand, the “incalculably diffusive” effects of “unhistoric acts” project a fate for its protagonist, Dorothea Brooke, one of the “later-born Theresas” who despite her “passionate, ideal nature” cannot lead an “epic life” but has to contend with a private, invisible life, which might be seen as a failure of Eliot’s feminist vision. But Dorothea couldn’t have been rescued from her fate precisely because even though Eliot herself had found as escape in her career as a writer most women at the time of the novel’s composition were still bound by the social forces of the time and not much had changed for women since the time in which the novel is set. Coming back to this novel for a paper last semester made me realise that it is one of my favourite books ever and there are so many reasons for why that is so. Eliot’s writing is so funny and I had absolutely no recollection of this! There is not one boring moment in the entire novel, which is to say also that not one bit of it seems superfluous or unnecessary. Above all, Eliot demands that the reader performs unflinching and unshakeable acts of sympathy throughout the reading of novel and that taught me more than any novel held together by an overarching moral perspective could have.

It’s finally over.One of my goals in life is to read as many classic works of literature as I can, while still reading as much as I want for pleasure in the other genres I love. I’ve been fortunate enough to read some amazing novels that have stood the test of time. Jane Eyre and Frankenstein, The Picture of Dorian Gray and The Count of Monte Cristo, and so many more were such a pleasure to read that I have and will continue to revisit them. Not so with my first introduction to Eliot’s work. I can’t see myself ever revisiting Middlemarch, but who knows what the future holds, right?I had high hopes for this book. Middlemarch has been billed as one of the most influential novels of the English language. I don’t see it. In Henry James’s critique of the novel, he said that “Middlemarch is a treasure-house of details, but is an indifferent whole.” I can see where he’s coming from, even if I didn’t enjoy said details. Eliot packed a lot of character development into this book, especially for a novel of its time. There was a lot of growth particularly on the parts of Dorothea, Fred Vincy, and Lydgate. But even considering this growth, all I wanted to do was escape Middlemarch and never return. I don’t think I could have survived during that time period in such a small, judgmental little community. I would’ve lost my mind.A few of the books to which Middlemarch has been compared are Jane Eyre, Pride and Prejudice, and Vanity Fair. All three of which I enjoyed. Jane Eyre is one of my top five favorite classics I’ve read to date. I have no idea why I didn’t enjoy Middlemarch more. I felt that it was overly verbose, and would have benefited dramatically from a good editor. I also found many of the characters unlikeable and, despite the aforementioned character development, I found these improvements a bit unsatisfying, as if the developments weren’t far-reaching enough. I’m glad I can say that I read Middlemarch. And I hope to never meet its like again. I respect both what it accomplished in showing the inner workings and politics of a small town during the Victorian era, and what it tried to do with revealing the hidden depths of its characters and how they adapt and grow throughout the story. However, it’s just not a book I can claim to have enjoyed. While I didn’t loathe it as much as Wuthering Heights and Ulysses, Middlemarch is not a classic that I can ever see myself passionately recommending to others. For me, it was a book to be suffered through, not savored.I buddy read this book with the lovely TS, in hopes of balancing out the wretchedness that is Les Misérables. No such luck. Be both felt this book was a disaster. Thankfully we're loving Les Misérables!"
179,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4763420-kaelan,Rating 5 out of 5,"I'm not the biggest fan of realist fiction. But Middlemarch ranks up there with my favourite works of art in any medium. First off, I strongly believe that Mary Ann ""George Eliot"" Evans is one of history's foremost investigators of human nature. I mean, her methodology can't be any less scientific than officially sanctioned psychoanalysts like Freud or Lacan. And unlike Lacan, at least, she's actually a joy to read...Just as impressive, Middlemarch—the chronicle of several intersecting small-town English lives—revolves around a research question. Seriously, a research question. (Just read the preface.) History, as we all know, is replete with great souls performing great deeds under great circumstances. But what (Eliot asks) about great souls acting under resoundingly mediocre circumstances? Does this greatness manifest itself in repression? In madness? Perhaps there needn't be any outward manifestation at all? (The gendered aspects of this are very much apparent, although Eliot investigates both sexes with equal rigour.)At the same time, the novel unfolds in a completely natural way, with its own internal logic. Never does Eliot engage in what I like to call ""Randian storytelling,"" where an author's guiding thesis overwhelms the individual psychologies of his characters. Eliot, on the contrary, conducts herself like some clockmaker demiurge, setting the initial (largely psychological and economic) conditions for her world, inserting a chance event here and there to spice things up, but largely sitting back and letting things play out as they will.Finally, although (in my own sophomoric opinion) Eliot is no Melville or Woolf when it comes to prose style, her writing is completely up to the task and, to its credit, displays an aphoristic aptitude of which Oscar Wilde would (or should) have been jealous. Just consider the following one-liners, which I've amassed more or less at random:If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel's heart beat, and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence.It is a narrow mind which cannot look at a subject from various points of view.And, of course men know best about everything, except what women know better.We mortals, men and women, devour many a disappointment between breakfast and dinner-time; keep back the tears and look a little pale about the lips, and in answer to inquiries say, ""Oh, nothing!"" Pride helps; and pride is not a bad thing when it only urges us to hide our hurts—not to hurt others.I could go on and on and on about the other merits of this book. But perhaps Woolf said it best when she called Middlemarch ""one of the few English novels written for grownup people."" Most ardently recommended."

That kind of age when your life is totally crap so when you find a book you can live in, God do you live in that book. I was so in love with Middlemarch that I actually got a detention for refusing to stop reading it on one of the rare occasions I'd gone to school.Aaand last year I decided to read it again.Re-visit it again, even. Because that's how it felt to me: like it would be re-visting a place I used to live. Friends I used to know.I thought it was going to be like this:But it was actually more sorta like this:I ... I don't know what happened. Like the tone was really ... ponderous and Victorian. It was like I was trying to read the book and George Eliot was following me around going ""so, you see, when she said that, she meant this, because she's this sort of person, and when he does this, it's because this and so it means this"" and I'm like ""George, I'm READING.""I think what I loved about this as a teenager that it's the epitome of the Victorian ordered world: you have a benign narrator who knows ALL THE THINGS and will EXPLAIN ALL THE THINGS and you don't have to worry your pretty little head about anything.But ... I like worrying my pretty little head about things. It's basically what my pretty little head is for.I'm used to there being more space for me as a reader I think. Whereas to George Eliot the reader is very much the passive vessel in which to receive a, uh, hefty spurting of Middlemarch.And maybe that's great if you're a confused teenager or you live in an age before the DVD boxset.But it is just not what I need or am looking for in my life right now.I'm sorry George.

This is the long story of many characters in the small town of Middlemarch in the late 1800's rural England. Some are young, hoping to seal their futures and some are older with a little more wisdom of life but often not any smarter for the experience. Mostly it is the story of Dorothea Brooke, her aspirations, journey and mistakes. Following Dorothea and watching Dorothea come of age and all the great writing of Elliot around this character was my favorite and I think will be my most lasting impression of this wonderful novel. Then there was the trials and tribulations of Doctor Lydgate, a character I could so relate to. A young doctor who hopes to accomplish so much and finds himself unable to follow his hopes and dreams into any reality. Then there is Will and Rosamond Vincy, brother and sister who each must find a way to break out from their own ideas of the life they expect from the life they get. The further I got into the book, the more I thought that 800+ pages were not going to be enough to really investigate all that had been begun in these pages.I will admit that the first 400 pages were somewhat of a trial. At times I felt they were over wordy, causing me to have to read sections over and over (even listening to the on audio as I read) in order to really understand the thread of the meaning in all the chaff of words. I admit it has been a long time since I've read a classic of this era and there are definitely some shades of Dickens in the length and meandering of the writing but Elliot never strayed too far from her characters stories and she always came back to Dorothea which made it all worthwhile. In all I was so glad I took the time and effort to read and re-read so much of this great novel. If you haven't read it, set aside a few weeks and take it slow. There is so much here and you will be glad you did. I loved it, have a wonderful Penguin Deluxe Edition will stay on my shelf for a future re-read."
182,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1719442-jen,Rating 4 out of 5," Eliot could give depth of character to someone like Al Gore. I'm not sure how she would have gone about it, but I know that she could have done it. I'm convinced by this: ""Miss Brooke argued from words and dispositions not less unhesitatingly than other young ladies of her age. Signs are small measurable things, but interpretations are illimitable, and in girls of sweet, ardent nature, every sign is apt to conjure up wonder, hope, belief, vast as a sky, and coloured by a diffused thimbleful of matter in the shape of knowledge. They are not always too grossly deceived; for Sinbad himself may have fallen by good-luck on a true description, and wrong reasoning sometimes lands poor mortals in right conclusions; starting a long way off the true point, and proceeding by loops and zigzags, we now and then arrive just where we ought to be.  At least, the place where one ought to be in a reality of the time period of Middlemarch. Reading it today, I can't help but have a different ending reality for many of the characters.  To be honest, Eliot does this huge expose of Middlemarchers and then, at the end, she fits them into their futures with a bit of a kerplunk and a wry smile. And I'm a little miffed at her for leaving out Mr. Farebrother, who deserved better. To now, as a reader, have all of the information I feel I need to carry these characters with me (to know, for example, that Dorothea would hate the dog-purse toting section of today's society) and yet to have to acknowledge that their ending place in their literary dollhouse is wooden and fixed, it's pretty disappointing.  So why four stars? The writing is sublime. Even when puttering along at a snail's pace, there is a beauty to it. And, like I've written already, the masterful way she attends to every character, turning them this way and that, dressing them, coloring in their peculiarities, making sure that the reader know that she knows everything about everything there is to know about Middlemarch and its peoples.

Eliot has strong themes that pervade the entire novel: marriage, the obedience of a wife to her husband, and the severe consequences if she doesn't, the unhappiness a woman may experience being dominated by her husband and unable to pursue her own occupations, employment, Victorian expectations of a man and occupations scaled high to low, some women's desire to ideas and employment frowned upon and scorned at the time. I commend GE taking on the injustices to women, and men of the time. She writes strong and formidable female characters, which is necessary for my personal enjoyment. And, of course she is a smart writer. The reasons I've rated Middlemarch as I have is due to its long winded nature, which felt to me as unnecessary causing the story to be bogged down. In conclusion, it was a droll book in my opinion. I much preferred A Mill on the Floss."

Und irgendwo in dem gewaltigen Wust aus Rezensionen, Analysen, Studien und Hintergrundinformationen stößt man immer mal wieder auf das Urteil, dies sei nun das beste, das ultimative, das wichtigste Werk der englischsprachigen Literatur. Da erstarrt man natürlich in Ehrfurcht. Und reibt sich die Augen, fragt man sich doch, ob man das einfach nicht wahrhaben wollte oder hat man es schlicht nicht verstanden? Denn tief im eigenen Herzen – also dem, das für die Literatur schlägt – sträubt sich etwas dagegen, dem Verdikt zuzustimmen. Das mag daran liegen, daß man Vergleiche dieser Art einfach nicht mag, daran, daß in der eigenen Anschauung das eine Werk kaum mit dem andern vergleichbar ist, zu unterschiedlich die Stile, die Haltung, die Sprache und häufig genug auch der Inhalt.George Eliots gewaltiger Roman, in Folge erschienen 1871/72, bietet, laut des Untertitels im Original, eine „Studie über das Leben in der Provinz“. Die titelgebende Kleinstadt Middlemarch, gelegen irgendwo in Mittelengland, ist ein etwas verschlafenes Provinznest, wo sich die Wege einiger Menschen nicht nur der besseren Gesellschaft kreuzen. Es kommt zu Liebeshändeln und Eheversprechen, zu Verhandlungen um Erbschaften, es werden die anstehenden Reformen des Reform Act von 1832 diskutiert, die eine nachhaltige Änderung der britischen Wahlkreise und letztlich des Wahlrechts bedeutete, und vor allem wird sehr viel darüber philosophiert, was Mann und Frau vom Leben erwarten dürfen, wozu sie das Schicksal an ihren Platz gestellt hat und welchem Gesetz – dem des Papiers oder dem des Herzens – der oder die einzelne folgen sollte.Die erste Erwartung, die der Roman definitiv enttäuscht – und somit auch die Neugier und Tratschsucht des Lesers unterläuft – ist die, diese Stadt wirklich vorgeführt zu bekommen. Tatsächlich enthält sich Eliot nahezu vollständig jedweder Beschreibung des Ortes, seiner Straßen. Nimmt man es genau, wird der Leser nur äußerst selten wirklich nach Middlemarch selbst entführt, denn das Gros der Handlung spielt sich in den umliegenden Herrenhäusern und Gutshöfen ab, in welchen die den Roman prägenden Figuren leben. Die nächste Erwartung des Lesers, die enttäuscht wird, ist die Hoffnung auf eine Story, auf eine wirkliche Handlung, die den Namen auch verdient hat. Das meiste, was auf diesen vielen, vielen Seiten präsentiert wird, spielt sich in den Köpfen der Protagonisten ab. Was insofern nicht überraschen sollte, gilt das Werk – und das vollkommen zurecht – doch als ein Meisterwerk des psychologischen Romans. Selten hat Literatur derart genau, präzise und auch kompromißlos das Innenleben seiner Figuren durchdrungen, analysiert, studiert und ausgestellt. Und es bestätigt sich bald eine weitere häufig geäußerte Ansicht zum Roman: Das Grundmotiv ist das Scheitern. Nahezu jeder hier scheitert – an seinen Wünschen, an zu hoch gesteckten Hoffnungen und Zielen, an Erwartungen, die die Wirklichkeit nicht erfüllen kann, an einer Welt, einer Gesellschaft, die – wir befinden uns mitten im viktorianischen Zeitalter – in einem engen Korsett moralischer Vorstellungen und strenger Konventionen steckt. Exemplarisch stehen dafür zwei der wesentlichen Figuren: Dorothea Brooke, eigentliche Hauptfigur des Romans, und Tertius Lydgate, ein junger Mann aus guter Familie, der sich der Medizinwissenschaft zugewandt hat, mit neuartigen Behandlungsmethoden experimentiert und neu in der Stadt ist, in der er sein Glück zu machen hofft.Die Geschichten der beiden sind auf interessante Art gegeneinandergesetzt. Dorothea strebt nach Höherem, sie wurde umfassend ausgebildet – ungewöhnlich für eine Frau jener Jahre, durchaus aber ein Spiegel der Autorin – und möchte sich, ihr Wissen, ihre Interessen, ganz in den Dienst höherer Aufgaben stellen. Sie heiratet mir Mr. Casaubon einen Geistlichen, dem höhere Weihen nachgesagt werden, womöglich gar Bischofsweihen, der aber persönlich auf der Suche nach dem „Schlüssel zu allen Mythologien“ ist, einer Arbeit, die den wahren Grund hinter der mythischen Geschichte des Abendlandes darlegen soll, von Beginn an aber zum Scheitern verurteilt ist – aufgrund der gewaltigen Aufgabe einerseits, der verzagten Art des Studierenden andererseits. Lydgate seinerseits eröffnet eine Praxis in der Stadt, nimmt zugleich eine Stellung in einem neu eröffneten Hospital an, gerät damit aber in die politischen Ränkespiele in Middlemarch. Denn der Geldgeber des Krankenhauses ist nicht wohl gelitten in der Stadt und ihrer Umgebung. Ldgate heiratet eine der angesehensten jungen Damen der Umgebung und steigt damit vermeintlich im sozialen Gefüge der Stadt auf. Doch wird er zusehends zerrieben zwischen den eigenen wie den Ansprüchen seiner Frau, den kleingeistigen Streitereien und gerät schließlich, erdrückt von Schulden, in Ränke und Intrigen, die ihn resignieren lassen.Um diese beiden Figuren herum gibt es eine Anordnung von etlichen Personen, deren Kreise sich mal überschneiden, sich manchmal aus dem Wege gehen und in denen sich das Scheitern der Hauptfiguren spiegelt, gelegentlich fortsetzt, ist das Glück des einen doch häufig von den Taten anderer abhängig, die aber, da Eliot sie äußerst geschickt anordnet und sie derart in das weitreichende System ihrer Überlegungen einflicht, daß sie zugleich die Möglichkeit hat, ganz unterschiedliche Kreise und Klassen darzustellen. So gelingt es ihr durchaus, einen gesellschaftlichen Durchschnitt des ländlichen, provinziellen Englands des 19. Jahrhunderts zu zeichnen. Da gibt es die Landjunker und die Geistlichen, es gibt die Landarbeiter und in Caleb Garth einen Vertreter des Handwerks, dessen Ehrlichkeit und Sittsamkeit, aber auch Menschenfreundlichkeit und Lebensklugheit ihn zu einem der wenigen in diesem Reigen macht, der allein deshalb schon nicht scheitert, da er mit seinem Leben, darin aber eben auch mit der eigenen Stellung zufrieden ist. Doch auch er und seine Frau sind vor Enttäuschungen nicht gefeit, entpuppen sich doch einige derer, denen sie ihr Vertrauen schenken, als unverantwortlich und unzuverlässig. Anhand der Figur eines jungen Mannes wie Fred Vincy, dessen Schwester Rosamond Lydgate geheiratet hat und den Caleb Garth unter seine Fittiche nimmt, kann Eliot aber auch einen Gegenentwurf darstellen: Ein junger Mann von höherem Stand, dessen Leben als ein einziges großes Scheitern sich abzeichnet und der durch das Leben und seine Lehren, die zu lesen und verstehen Fred in der Lage ist, aber auch durch die Führung eines Älteren – eben Caleb Garth, dessen Tochter Mary Fred begehrt und die ihn immer zu nehmen weiß, bis er genau so ist, wie sie ihn haben will – lernt, was das gelungene Leben bedeutet und daß es dafür oft viel weniger braucht, als man denkt, vor allem, wenn man nicht nur auf den schnöden Mammon fixiert ist.Eliot ist es – anders als ihren Kollegen wie Thomas Hardy oder Charles Dickens – allerdings nicht darum zu tun, ein realistisches Sozialdrama zu schildern, genaues Lokalkolorit abzubilden, sie prangert keine sozialen Mißstände an, sie liefert auch kein Plädoyer für einen gesellschaftlichen Aufbruch. Diese Ebenen streift sie, wenn überhaupt, eher wie nebenbei, voraussetzend, daß ihre Leser um die politischen Implikationen – bspw. des Reform Act – wissen und diese einordnen können. Auch bietet sie wenig Beschreibungen – es wurde weiter oben bereits anhand der Stadt Middlemarch gesagt, die der Leser im Grunde nie wirklich kennenlernt – von Landschaften oder der Menschen. Der Großteil der Handlung – und viel davon gibt es im Grunde nicht; am ehesten noch kann der Handlungsstrang um einen alten Bekannten von Mr. Bulstrode, dem Geldgeber des Hospitals, der den mittlerweile Wohlhabenden wie ein Fluch der Vergangenheit einholt und droht, dessen Lebensabend zu vergällen, als wirklicher Plot bezeichnet werden – spielt sich in Dialogen ab. Und, natürlich und noch weitaus wesentlicher, im Innern der Figuren. MIDDLEMARCH ist definitiv nicht nur der allseits gelobte psychologische, sondern auch ein philosophischer Roman, ein Bildungsroman, ein Langessay, eine große Reflexion über das Leben und die Lebenden generell. Eine Meditation über die Allgemeingültigkeit menschlichen Strebens und dessen Vergeblichkeit.Obwohl Eliot ein ausgesprochen gutes Gespür für die Psychologie ihrer Figuren hat, erstaunt es, wie blass doch einige Charaktere bleiben. Nun sind dies sicherlich keine Karikaturen, wie wir sie häufig bei Dickens antreffen, auch keine tragischen Heldinnen und Helden, wie Hardy sie uns in seinen frühen Melodramen bietet, Menschen, die aufbegehren, Menschen, die ihrer Zeit teils weit voraus scheinen. Eliots Figuren sind dafür weitaus lebensnäher, eher ähneln sie jenen Figuren, die Jane Austen erschuf, dem Leben abgeschaut und wahrlich von der Autorin durchdrungen. Einige dieser Protagonisten hier machen kaum Entwicklungen durch, bleiben sich immer gleich, manche bleiben nahezu erratisch. Dazu ist die junge Mary Garth zu zählen, die von Fred und dem Hilfspfarrer Farebrother gefreit wird und die der Leser eher als Objekt der Projektionen dieser beiden Männer kennenlernt, denn als eigenständige Figur – und die dennoch oder gerade deshalb die eine Figur in diesem Roman ist, die mit sich und der Welt von allem Anfang an im Reinen scheint.George Eliot war eine für ihre Zeit immens moderne Frau. Sie gehörte zu jenen liberalen Freidenkern, die von Robert Owen und dessen schon frühsozialistischen Ideen beeinflusst waren. Die junge Frau setzte sich mit diesen Ideen auseinander, was u.a. dazu führte, daß sie sich zugleich immer kritischer mit der englischen Gesellschaft, aber auch mit Fragen der Religion auseinandersetzte, die sie mehr und mehr in Frage stellte. In Werken wie MIDDLEMARCH wird sehr deutlich, wie kritisch Eliot der Religion, mehr aber der institutionellen Kirche gegenüberstand. Denn ähnlich wie bei Jane Austen sind auch hier Geistliche im Grunde Lokalpolitiker, deren Wort und deren Ansichten Gewicht haben, deren sozialer „Wert“ sich nicht zuletzt vom Ertrag ihrer Pfründe ableitet. Klassische Honoratioren eben. Eliot ging weit für eine Frau ihrer Herkunft und Zeit – Tochter eines Gutsverwalters, was sie auch in die Nähe von Mary Garth und ihrer Familie setzt – , die auch journalistisch arbeitete. Das männliche Pseudonym war also wahrscheinlich notwendig, um als Stimme in einer Zeit, die Frauen Herd und Heim als Wirkungsraum zuwies, wahr- und ernstgenommen zu werden. Eliot war gebildet, weitaus gebildeter, als es Damen ihrer Klasse (und man unterschätze nicht das englische Klassensystem!) normalerweise zustand. Und diese Bildung kommt in MIDDLEMARCH voll zum Tragen, ja, man könnte behaupten, daß der Roman unter anderem auch eine klare und selbstbewusste Ausstellung dieser Bildung ist.Denn diese Bildung fließt nahezu ungefiltert in den Roman ein. Das ist einerseits interessant, macht die Lektüre andererseits aber auch sehr anstrengend. Denn einfache Handlungsmomente – ein Treffen im Salon zwischen einem Mann und einer Frau (in unterschiedlichsten Konstellationen) – können durchaus mehrseitige philosophische Betrachtungen des Wesens dessen, was die betreffende Figur, derer Perspektive sich die auktoriale Erzählerin gerade bedient, vom Bevorstehenden erwartet, vorangestellt werden. Dabei zitiert die Autorin nicht nur ausgiebig antike Mythen und die vielzählige, Eliot bekannte, Literatur, sondern es werden in einer oft höchst komplexen und dementsprechend komplizierten Sprache – welche Melanie Walz, das sei an dieser Stelle ausdrücklich betont, in dieser Neuübersetzung kongenial ins Deutsche übertragen hat – auch die vielfältigen Vor- und Nachteile, das Für und Wider dieser oder jener Haltung, dieser oder jener Lebenssicht, die Aussichten und Enttäuschungen von zarten, zu großen und manchmal unmöglichen Hoffnungen und Erwartungen erörtert.Vergleicht man diese Sprache mit jener derselben Generation wie Eliot entstammenden Autoren – eben Austen, Dickens, aber auch die Brontë-Schwestern oder Anthony Trollope – wirkt sie einerseits gewaltiger, wirkmächtiger, ernsthafter, intellektueller, zugleich aber auch altmodischer, eher dem Roman des 18. Jahrhunderts verpflichtet, denn an neuen sprachlichen Wegen interessiert. Eher ist es die Form des Romans, sind es seine Möglichkeiten, die Eliot zu reizen scheinen. Der erinnert den (post)modernen Leser in seiner schieren Maßlosigkeit, in seinem Überschwang, der eher zurückhaltenden Handlung und den ausschweifenden Überlegungen und Meta-Betrachtungen an Romane wie Melvilles MOBY DICK (1851), vorausgreifend sogar an Musils DER MANN OHNE EIGENSCHAFTEN (1930) oder Thomas Pynchons GRAVITY´S RAINBOW (1973). Werke, die man als strenger Literaturwissenschaftler gut und gern auch als gescheitert betrachten kann, scheinen sie doch nie eine Einheit aus Stil, Inhalt und Form zu finden. Romane, die, folgt man Musil in der Einschätzung seines Werkes, für Menschen geschrieben wurden, die es noch nicht gibt, Menschen der Zukunft.So wirkt MIDDLEMARCH auf den heutigen Leser wie ein seltsamer Zwitter. Ein hochmoderner Roman, offenbar seiner Zeit voraus, der die herkömmliche Form des Formats sprengt, der die ganze Welt in seine Seiten hineinholen will, das menschliche Wesen und dessen Dasein zu durchdringen wagt, alles in den Ring wirft, was die Autorin an intellektuellen, sozialen und empathischen Erkenntnissen und Einsichten aufbieten kann, insofern ein äußerst mutiger Roman, der das Scheitern menschlichen Strebens nicht nur thematisiert, sondern auch immer das eigene Scheitern in Kauf nimmt, ja geradezu herausfordert; und zugleich ein Monster, das sich sprachlich sperrig gibt, gestrig, fast altmodisch, sich orientierend an den Klassikern der damals bekannten Weltliteratur, an der Lyrik, geschult an Mythen, Sagen, Fabeln und Gleichnissen der Antike und natürlich den prägenden Texten des christlich-jüdischen abendländischen Glaubens verbunden.Das ist oftmals beschwerlich zu lesen, es passiert wenig und der Leser kämpft mit Umwegen und Umständlichkeiten, die es so in der modernen Literaturproduktion nicht mehr gibt oder aber, kommen sie einmal vor, ausgesprochen prätentiös wirken. Doppelte Verneinungen, sich dialektisch aufbauende Pro-und-Contra-Argumentationen, manchmal leise Ironie, die die Tiefsinnigkeit des Dargelegten jedoch nie wirklich unterläuft oder gar in Frage stellt, manchmal, selten, beißender Sarkasmus, der jedoch nie grob daherkommt, sondern immer hintersinnig und doch scharf. All dies verpackt in eben dieser gewundenen Sprache, die den modernen Leser fordert. Und auch dies gehört zur Wahrheit dieses Romans: Über eine solch lange Strecke – 1200 Seiten – lassen sich Längen nicht vermeiden. Wo Charles Dickens dem Leser oftmals allzu unglaubwürdige Zufälle und Umstände präsentiert, um seine Handlung voranzutreiben, Handlungen übrigens, die meist recht actionreich und somit spannend und aufregend sind, verzichtet Eliot auf nahezu jede Form von Erzählung. Diesen Figuren widerfährt nahezu nichts Unerwartetes. Der Auftritt von Raffles, jenem Menetekel aus Mr. Bulstrodes Vergangenheit, ist eines der wenigen Handlungselemente, das so etwas wie Spannung erzeugt. Und sogleich wirkt es schon deplatziert. Denn sämtliche weiteren Handlungselemente dieses Romans speisen sich nahezu ausschließlich aus dem Innern der Figuren. Sie erleben sich, erleben ihre Gefühle, lernen sich kennen, müssen an sich zweifeln und durch Prüfungen gehen, die sie Entwicklungen unterwerfen, denen sie sich nicht (mehr) entziehen können. Da wirkt die Erpressungsgeschichte um Raffles und Bulstrode wie ein Laborversuch in Schicksalsbetrachtung – als müsse irgendwo hier noch nachgewiesen werden, daß wir unserem Schicksal so oder so nicht entgehen können. Gleich, ob es uns emotional mit sich reißt oder uns in den Konsequenzen unserer früheren Entscheidungen und Handlungen einholt.So erinnert Eliots Roman durchaus an jene ihrer Kollegin Austen. In beiden Fällen hat man es mit klassischen Gesellschaftsromanen zu tun. Genaue zeitgenössische Beobachtungen der sozialen, emotionalen und vor allem auch der ökonomischen Bedingungen. Stärker als bei Austen tritt bei Eliot bereits das feministische Element hervor. Sie sieht sehr genau, wie Frauen in den engen Konventionen des Viktorianismus in ihren Möglichkeiten eingeschränkt wurden, sie sieht die Käfige und Fesseln, in denen sie gefangen, in die sie geschlagen werden – Käfige des Wohlstands und des sozialen Ansehens; Fesseln aus als weniger wichtig angesehenen geschriebenen und als sehr wichtig betrachteten ungeschriebenen Gesetzen. Und Eliot sieht sehr genau, wie die Mechanismen der verschiedenen Bereiche und Ebenen des Lebens ineinandergreifen, um Macht auszuüben, Macht zu konsolidieren und sie zu sichern. Macht, die vor allem Männer über Frauen ausüben.So ist es schlußendlich die reine Existenz dieses gewaltigen Romans womöglich sein größtes Verdienst. Als Beleg für ein Frauenschicksal im 19. Jahrhundert, welches auch ein Aufbegehren gegen herrschende Regeln von Anstand und Konvention darstellte, ein Werk, das ebenso eindringlich und nachhaltig beweist, daß eine Frau ihres Standes und ihrer Herkunft sehr wohl über Bildung verfügen konnte und erst recht in der Lage war, diese Bildung zu transferieren und in eine Form zu gießen, die etwas Bleibendes schafft. Ein Romanwerk, welches die Zeiten übersteht und dem schließlich die Ehre zuteilwurde, von Kritikern und Schriftstellerkollegen zum bedeutendsten Roman der englischsprachigen Literatur gewählt worden zu sein."
189,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82453-jenna,Rating 5 out of 5,"For a long time, I hesitated to review this book. I said to myself, ""There's nothing I could say about Middlemarch that hasn't been said -- with more eloquence -- by others in the past."" Yet, if I don't break my silence now, then you -- a person who has never read Middlemarch or has not yet made up his/her mind what to think of it -- you will never realize how fervently I love this book and esteem it above all other books in existence. Therefore, despite my insecurities, I'll now throw my fumbling, inadequate praises into the ring. After all, if Middlemarch teaches us anything, it teaches us that there is value even in fumbling, inadequate praises, just as there is value in small-scale, ""unhistoric"" good deeds. Just as Dorothea, despite the counsels of some of her more pragmatic relations, spoke up to say she believed in Dr. Lydgate in his time of need, I will now speak up to say I believe in Middlemarch.What strikes me most on revisiting Middlemarch at my age is how modern it is. The concerns of Eliot's young characters -- Dorothea, Fred, Rosamond, Mary, Will, and Tertius -- are the exact same concerns that now loom large in the brains of myself and my agemates, us pennant-bearers of the generation the media has sneeringly dubbed ""the Millennials."" We struggle with the same questions in real life that Eliot's characters struggle with on the page: for example, What sort of institution is marriage, and what sort of person should one marry? (In Eliot's novels, to a greater extent than in either Austen's or Bronte's novels, a spouse is portrayed not just as the other figurine atop one's wedding cake, but as a life partner, someone to share years of medical, financial, and emotional ups-and-downs with: a broader, more realistic conception of marriage, which Eliot was able to develop because she had the good fortune to live longer and experience more of life than either Austen or Bronte.)No less important in Middlemarch than the marriage question is this question: What sort of career should one devote one's life to? One of the features that makes Eliot stand out from contemporaries like Austen and Bronte is the fact that Eliot's characters, like real flesh-and-blood people, have interests in their lives besides love and marriage; most of them have jobs, and many of them have careers. The pages of Middlemarch are populated by doctors, lawyers, artists, journalists, politicians, farmers, land agents, governesses, companions (what we nowadays call ""home health aides""), and clergymen. And these characters don't just wear their jobs casually, like neckties: they agonize at length about whether they have chosen the right jobs, about whether their jobs are fulfilling/self-actualizing, and about whether they have chosen their jobs for the right reasons (or whether they have allowed themselves to be pushed down a particular career path to please their parents, as the weak-spined Fred Vincy almost does).To his elderly benefactor Mr. Casaubon's chagrin, Will Ladislaw changes his mind no less than twice about what profession he will adopt: initially, he sets out to become an artist, then renounces art for journalism, before ultimately giving up journalism for politics. Is there any substantial difference between Will's behavior and the behavior of the real-life youths that today's newspapers rather unfairly chide with words like ""lazy,"" ""unfocused,"" and ""man-child""? When Fred Vincy moves back into his parents' house after graduating from university in Chapter 56, awkwardly offering to pay for his board (an offer that his father refuses), is his behavior substantially any different from that of the many young people nowadays who live with their parents well into their thirties?There are so many little touches that make this book more realistic, and more relatable, than any other book of its time, or of any time: the sisterly conversations between Dorothea and Celia, for instance, or the brilliantly-drawn friendships between Tertius and Will, between Tertius and Mr. Farebrother, between Fred and Mr. Farebrother, and even between Fred and Tertius (that one scene in Chapter 66 where Fred invents a pretext to prevent Tertius from losing all his money at pool is moving enough to make at least this one reader tear up). If you haven't read Middlemarch before, read it. If you've read it before, read it again."
190,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28233498-gabrielle-dubois,Rating 5 out of 5,"George Eliot is fabulous!I like her painting of the English society of her time, and her humor.Oh, what a wonderful book! What great and strong portraits of women! For, who saves men? Who leads the guilty men to repentance? Who raises men, gets the best out of them? Who loves, knowing that loving is more difficult than being loved? Who forgives? Who understands? For George Eliot, clearly, it's women.Mary Garth has always loved Fred, but leads him to correct his flaws before responding to his love. It forces him, thanks to his mental and moral strength and thanks to love to become the man he was too lazy to become of himself.Dorothea, voluntarily moving Will away, to respect the wicked will of the late Casaubon, strengthens their love. She makes this love an even more beautiful and stronger love.Mrs. Bulstrode, by loving her husband despite his faults, forces him to do what he had never wanted to do: face the reality of his actions and sincerely repent, and even do any good deed that may be able to make up for his faults here on earth. Finally the proud Bulstrode becomes humble. Now his conscience is his and God's business.What about Rosamonde? Ah, Rosamonde has also changed in front of Dorothea. Of course, not all women are angels. Then we could feel sorry for Lydgate. But... he chose to marry Rosamonde, he had experience of the world and women before that. He was in a better position than she was to know what he was getting into. At the beginning of the story, Lydgate knew he had to choose between a wife and a household, or his medicinal research. But he chose: he chose Rosamonde.So? So all is well that ends well, I guess, and the Middlemarchians always remain the same: their prejudices do not move, see this funny passage:""Fred surprised his neighbors in various ways. He became rather distinguished in his side of the county as a theoretic and practical farmer, and produced a work on the ""Cultivation of Green Crops and the Economy of Cattle-Feeding"" which won him high congratulations at agricultural meetings. In Middlemarch admiration was more reserved: most persons there were inclined to believe that the merit of Fred's authorship was due to his wife, since they had never expected Fred Vincy to write on turnips and mangel-wurzel.But when Mary wrote a little book for her boys, called ""Stories of Great Men, taken from Plutarch,"" and had it printed and published by Gripp & Co., Middlemarch, every one in the town was willing to give the credit of this work to Fred, observing that he had been to the University, ""where the ancients were studied,"" and might have been a clergyman if he had chosen.In this way it was made clear that Middlemarch had never been deceived, and that there was no need to praise anybody for writing a book, since it was always done by somebody else.""On that note, George Eliot, it seems to me that I have learned the lesson: we are all Middlemarchians, it is up to us to choose which one we want to be: the one who does nothing but fills the void of his life by spreading gossip on others; the one who thinks only of himself and hopes that, as long as he does not look at himself in the mirror, he can see himself forever as a good person; or the one who keeps the course of strength and kindness towards and against everyone and hopes that love will triumph."
191,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108050456-zoe-inactive,Rating 5 out of 5,"Honestly Middlemarch has everything I want from a book.It's the OG slow burn romance: from ""they were looking at each other like two fond children, talking confidentially about birds"" to ""I never had a preference for her, any more than I have a preference for breathing. No other woman exists by the side of her. I would rather touch her hand if it were dead, than I would touch any other woman's living."" If this doesn't bring just the right level of drama, I don't know what does.There are female characters who slap, i mean, Dorothea develops from a smallminded meek mouse to a businesswoman of real caliber, while still being sympathetic and just... good, and she unltimateley goes after what she wants when the man's world stands in her way.And Mary who will forever be my darling.There are people you can absolutley pour all the hatred an loathing into that don't find a target in real life, be it for their being absolute shitforbrains human beings or so very selfish and jealous.There are intrigues! So many intrigues! And plot twits!And unexpected family ties!There's unhappy marriages, with husbands who hinder their wives' happiness even after death to wives who despise their husbands for trying to give them a good live (and, granted, failing at it).The subtitle Study of provincial life is so accurate? Everyone is always gossiping, ""Wives, widows and single ladies took their work and went out to tea oftener than usual"", people can't be seen with each other lest everyone knows about it and draws their own conclusions to the detriment of reputation and ultimately wealth and livelyhood - it's horrible, but very fun to watch unfold.I think Eliot thoroughly enjoyed writing this novel. Every Charcter is well fleshed out, even the ones we only meet once, and the omniscient narrator never shies from giving their own opinion - which was also fun!And the language! It's beautiful. I'm telling you, if I was the person who annotated their books, this would be heavily annotated. Being the lazy noodleboy I am, I only stuck about thirtysevenhundred lavender-coloured sticky notes in it to mark the passages I really liked. To go through at a later date, and maybe take some notes, you know.Only the kind if lengthy passages about local politics could have been a bit less tiresome. Otherwise, this is, in my humble opinion, an absulute delight. 10/10."
192,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/350233-casey,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow.Alright, so I knew Middlemarch would be great. After all, Harold Bloom cites it (along with Bleak House) as ""the canonical novel"" and Virginia Woolf called it ""magnificent."" However, I did not expect to finish this 853 page behemoth in seven days, and I certainly did not expect the writing to be quite so lovely. I was expecting writing similar to Austen or the Bronte sisters; what I got was Tolstoy in English, with just a dash of Proust.It's hard to write this review without comparing Eliot to Tolstoy: a fair comparison, as they were contemporaries, and realist authors. War and Peace and Middlemarch: A Study of Provincial Life were published around the same time, and both explore the early 19th century through the eyes of late 19th century writers. Many people at least give lip service to the fact that they should probably get around to reading War and Peace, although I don't often hear the same said about Middlemarch. That's too bad, as us anglophones have the marvelous opportunity of reading such a book in our native tongue.Middlemarch is surprisingly modern: one of the main characters, Dorothea, exhibits character growth by slowly becoming less morally righteous. At one point, I found myself wishing that Dorothea would stop being so upright and just get laid by someone attractive for a change. The interesting thing is that this moral fall is a good thing. George Eliot was no Edith Warton, and Dorothea ends up much better off that Lily Bart. Eliot explains that her characters ""were the mixed result of a young and noble impulse struggling amidst the conditions of an imperfect social state, in which great feelings will often that the aspect of error, and great fait the aspect of illusion."" You can bet she included all her references to The Pilgrim's Progress with a wink."

I am enjoying (re)reading along with them.✅ Even better the second time around. I just heard an Ali Smith interview this week wherein she said that books like Middlemarch are a different experience every decade of our lives. Which leads me to assume that SHE has read and reread it a few times. I want to be more like Ali Smith. And I just took one small (wait, big!) step. Literary Disco’s discussion of this book is fantastic! Check it out. I hope they do Moby Dick next summer. January-February 2016 first read:I liked it. I really, really liked it. That is what the 3* rating means. Though it seems rather harsh to leave two missing for this highly praised classic. It may go up one with time*. I enjoyed that I knew absolutely nothing going in, so had no idea where we were headed. When I realized that it encompassed so many characters and was so broad in spectrum, it became less of the Jane Austen-esque read I was expecting. It seems to me every type of person and situation is represented. High and low, generous and selfish, caring and cruel. And the grey in between people as well. Marriage, death, birth, poverty, riches. Okay you get it: it's all in Middlemarch. And I found that I cared what happened to everyone, and most especially a certain two. It was a wonderful resolution at the end, in my humble opinion. Hooray for finally getting around to reading this book, long on my TBR list.*Yes"

It is something like War and Peace without the battle of Borodino. While the protagonists grope their way blindly towards each other there is a fascinating discussion about how society progresses dealing primarily with the need to adopt more scientific medical practices in the United Kingdom. At the same there is a critique on the contemporary scholarship on mythology. Middlemarch is sure to please. At the end you are saddened to see that the courageous young Doctor who is applying the latest scientific treatments from Paris in England is not appreciated by his wife. At the same time, you are glad to see the sweet heroine Dorothea is a fresh widow freed from her pedant husband Casaubon and about to be married to the sharp-witted Will Ladislaw who is up on the latest scholarship from Germany. This is a thoroughly delightful novel and quite free from the melodramatic excesses that George Eliot occasionally fell into."

196,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,Rating 5 out of 5,"Second review: August 2020This review will reiterate some of the points of my earlier review, but enough time has passed and I have changed enough that I definitely took different things from this book this time. Nevertheless, still a classic and a masterpiece.Middlemarch is a sublime example of Victorian authors recognizing and attempting to chronicle a disappearing lifestyle. Eliot was alive to witness the industrialization of the English countryside, most notably the construction of the vast railway network that knit the United Kingdom together in bonds of coal and steel. Her characters are country folk who view this industrialization with scepticism. But as I note in my first review, this novel is not about industrialization so much as it is a microcosmic snapshot of English country life amidst that paradigm shift. This is a story of marital strife, living beyond your means, and attempting to find purpose in a world that sometimes seems all too arbitrary in the fates it deals you.To attempt to summarize Middlemarch is to fall into the wondrous experience of getting lost amongst its twist and tangle of so many delightful characters. I’ll examine each in turn.The book opens with Dorothea Brooke marrying, in short order, Mr. Casaubon, the rector of a nearby parish. The match initially seems perfect to studious and intelligent Dorothea, who recognizes that scholarship is likely beyond her means as a lady of her status yet craves the stimulation that might come from assisting Casaubon in his work. Eventually, Dorothea discovers what many a bride does after the honeymoon is over: marriage is not all it’s cracked up to be, especially if you didn’t take the time to get to know your groom beforehand. Dorothea, while not exactly stymied in her hopes, finds them perhaps too grand; she projected a tenacity onto Casaubon that he cannot, at his age and in his current health, match. After he dies, she find social status incredibly constrained: a rich widow, she theoretically has resources and power that she didn’t have mere months ago; on the other hand, her practical options for what she can do with her money and her life are limited.Contrast this with Dorothea’s younger sister, Celia, who follows a far more conventional arc for a young lady: marry the rich baronet who has come sniffing around, have a baby, enjoy your married life. Celia seems much more content to acquiesce to the quotidian elements of a married country woman of means than Dorothea ever was. This juxtaposition is but one of many that Eliot uses to illustrate one of Middlemarch’s themes: in this case, she is commenting on how people whose interests lean intellectual often find themselves unhappier than those who can lose themselves in the minutiae of manual labour, trades, or other such jobs.The juxtaposition of Fred Vincy and Tertius Lydgate provides a masculine complement to this theme. Vincy is shiftless, prone to running up debt, and has no idea what to do with his life. He eventually finds fulfillment not in intellectual pursuits but in farming and agricultural management, tutored by his father-in-law-to-be. Lydgate is well-educated, well-travelled, thoroughly intellectual, yet his aspirations to advance the cause of medicine are largely thwarted throughout the book by the cautious and superstitious townsfolk and by his ill-conceived decision to marry too early to Rosamond, Fred’s sister. Unable to follow his potential for lack of funds, unable to provide the lifestyle that Rosamond is accustomed to, Lydgate finds himself struggling for much of the novel. It’s only through the monetary intervention of Mr Bulstrode that he gets back on his feet, and even then, that soon becomes inconvenient.Bulstrode begins the novel as a side character who is not quite sympathetic. He’s the rich banker who holds the pursestrings, calls in the debts, and decides which people will get spots on the board of the new hospital. We’re supposed to see him as a bit of a spider in the middle of a web. Yet as the novel progresses, the narrator turns up the sympathy: Bulstrode has a skeleton in his closet, and when that skeleton arrives in Middlemarch threatening to reveal Bulstrode’s dark secret, we see an internal struggle between his Christian values and his need to preserve his status in Middlemarch society. This is maybe Eliot at her most Dickensian? Whereas Dickens goes for more overt, laugh-out-loud farce and satire, however, Eliot seems more interested in humour through that subtle juxtaposition I mentioned earlier.Middlemarch is thus, in this way, a story of duality, of opposites. Intellectuals and non-intellectuals; labourers and thinkers; youthfulness and experience. Eliot is not judging any particular class of people but rather gathering them together to illustrate how they interrelate at this time in British history. This was an exciting time politically, a time of exuberant elections and strong expressions of political will. Now that I’m out as trans, I find myself reading Dorothea’s journey and identifying a lot with her, wondering how I would have fared in her era—I mean, I’d almost certainly be stuck living as a man, and therefore I’d likely be able to pursue my scholarly leanings, but still … it’s food for thought, the way women were constrained at the time, and what it took for them to break out of moulds the way Eliot did with her work.I love the lushness of Middlemarch’s description and prose. Eliot and Hardy together are my two favourite Victorians. Eliot doesn’t quite match Hardy’s penchant for sad endings (thank goodness), but I think they both enjoy trying to preserve in writing a landscape and culture they saw as increasingly tenuous, if not extinct entirely by their time. Whereas Hardy’s prose, informed by his inner poet, is often lyrical and mellifluous, Eliot’s is precise and architectural in construction. Her narrator explicitly tells you what some characters are like, drawing comparisons that contemporary readers especially would find illuminating. Eliot’s allusions to classical literature and art are especially rich. This is a novel of intense, dedicated craftsmanship, of construction so intricate and careful that I can only describe it as loving.There is a phrase that comes to mind: they just don’t build them like they used to. Middlemarch embodies this phrase. I say this with all love to modern novels, which I devour and read as much as possible. But this book is to modern novels what a classic car is to modern vehicles. You just don’t see many novels like this in a lifetime (and in my opinion, as I have mentioned, Eliot knocks it out of the park at least twice, because I like The Mill on the Floss even better than Middlemarch!).If you have read Austen and Brontë and you want to dip into Victorian fiction but feel intimidated by the verbosity of Dickens, Eliot would be a nice starting point. Yes, Middlemarch is as long as many Dickens novels, but it is not as dense. It has plenty of breathing room, moments where you can pause and luxuriate within the liminal spaces of each character’s arc and activity. Highly recommend, if you are feeling that kind of ambition come over you.Originally posted on Kara.Reviews, where you can easily browse all my reviews and subscribe to my newsletter.First review: June 2009This book blew me away. Forget Jane Austen or any of the Brontë sisters. I found Pride and Prejudice tolderable and liked Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre, but they are nothing compared to the scope and genius of Middlemarch. George Eliot has given Thomas Hardy and Charles Dickens a run for their money, and I think Middlemarch has won the title of My Favourite Victorian Novel.Middlemarch is sublime; it avoids the pitfalls that would label it ""pretentious"" rather than ""profound."" Its plethora of characters and several intertwining plots allows Eliot to keep the pace of the book progressing quite quickly. The narrator seldom dwells on any one point too long unless it's thematically important, and he or she is always willing to gloss over aspects of Middlemarch life that are irrelevant to its characters' stories. Eliot gives us an episodic glimpse at the lives of her characters, picking those instances which together form an overwhelming argument to advance her themes. Although Middlemarch is certainly long by today's standards, it deserves its length.Eliot masterfully balances several related but distinct plots that take place in the fictitious town of Middlemarch. Although the story takes place during the Great Reform Bill of 1832, politics plays a secondary role. The story is largely character-driven and focuses on rural English life, which sounds boring until you realize that it's utterly fascinating. It's like the Victorian version of reality television.Middlemarch owes its success to its characters. Every single character is three-dimensional, with virtues and vices, hopes and dreams and setbacks. Even characters who start out as seemingly two-dimensional foils or antagonists, like Rosamond Vincy and Mr. Bulstrode, turn into people for whom we feel a mixture of sympathy, pity, and disgust. Eliot doesn't pander to her readers; her characters do both noble deeds and horrible ones. Often the latter are so deliciously predictable that Middlemarch attains that enviable quality of being a trainwreck--too fascinating to turn away--without becoming camp or dull.Almost all of the conflict in Middlemarch stems from missteps by the characters themselves, along with a little external conflict added by itinerants like Raffles and Ladislaw. Eliot loves to pit two very likable characters against each other. Take, for instance, Mr. Farebrother and Fred Vincy, who both love Mary Garth. Mr. Farebrother's an honest vicar who's so well-meaning that he in fact sabotages his chances with Mary by acting as Fred's emissary. Fred, while somewhat indolent and unfocused, also means well and eventually determines to shape up and do whatever it takes to earn Mary's hand. As a result, Eliot creates quandaries to which there's no happy answer--a stark parallel to real life.Of course, that's what Middlemarch is: realism. Time and again, characters entertain delusions about the world around them that prove false and even harmful. Fred Vincy--his entire family, in fact--rely on the fact that he will inherit property from the ailing Peter Featherstone; he's left with nothing when Featherstone wills his estate to an illegitimate son from out of town. Dorothea marries the unattractive Mr. Casaubon because she believes it's her purpose in life to help him in his religious scholarship; instead, she ends up an unhappy widow who remarries a flighty man. Rosamond Vincy falls head-over-heels for up-and-coming Dr. Lydgate only to discover that he's far more in love with treating patients than attending parties. Lydgate experiences a similar dissatisfaction with his spendthrift new bride. In case you haven't noticed, a good deal of the unhappiness in Middlemarch stems from marital conflict.Eliot's observations about marriage--in fact, about life in general--are accurate and clever. She's like a funnier, more acerbic, more ironic Jane Austen (keep in mind that I say this while acknowledging that Jane Austen is a funny, acerbic, ironic author!). While I've shelved this book under romance, it definitely doesn't qualify for ""happily-ever-after."" Yet while Austen often demonstrated how marriage isn't all it's cracked up to be, her situations often felt contrived. In Middlemarch, on the other hand, the marital strife is organic; it's also reflected in the reactions of the townspeople. Eliot's social commentary is much stronger than Austen's because Eliot has constructed an entire microcosm in the form of Middlemarch society. As someone who enjoys living vicariously, Middlemarch particularly resonated with me, but it should appeal to everyone: the variety of views espoused by its characters expose you to perspectives you may otherwise never experience. Ultimately, that is what makes a story successful, and in an era where technology makes it increasingly easier to control the perspectives to which one's exposed, Middlemarch is all the more relevant."
197,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54104095-tom,Rating 5 out of 5,"""FUCKING good — Jane Austen + Passion + Dimension."" - Martin AmisThis is as much a Middlemarch review as it is a recount of my 2020 (considering it took me 293 days to finish it)God this book was worth the effort. It took me just under a month or thereabouts to finally get round to this review, sorry about that! However, I won't say I regret having this month to mull over how I would go about reviewing this behemoth. I was hounding Middlemarch for a good majority of 2020. It took me 139 days longer to read George Eliot’s masterpiece than it did Les Mis, a book that is 386 pages longer!But, as anyone who has read more than one big book can tell you, eventually page numbers stop mattering in regard to time taken. Instead, what really matters is the resolve that the reader has in themselves that they aren’t just wasting their time. This is especially hard when this entire year has felt, for the most part, like a waste of time. For me, this book was a hard one to get in to, especially for the fact that I went from reading Atonement by Ian McEwan to this. It was a big jump in both style and quality (mostly quality), not to mention a week after starting it, COVID got kicked into gear with the first of many lockdowns. From there, my work life got thrown into a weird limbo for the rest of the year working in a spattering of London bookshops, sending out ridiculous amounts of internet orders, working on some of the biggest returns Waterstones has ever had to process, not to mention being greeted almost each day by a local band of “book pirates” (roving vans of booksellers were tasked with getting into closed Waterstones shops and transferring the large sale items to the stores which had been repurposed into shipping warehouses. Very surreal.) Well, with all that flittering and strange liquidity in my work life, I think my reading life began to match. I just couldn’t seem to stick to Middlemarch; I didn’t have the patience. It was too stodgy, too much of a drawing room read for it to not clash against my reality. So, to get me through travelling an hour each day into central London on the tube, I read adventure stories and myths instead: I cleared through the Lord of the Rings trilogy on the central line; I listened to the works of Homer while walking down a barren Regent Street; I read Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy when bringing books back and forth between Gower St and Piccadilly Circus; and on my breaks I would read Girl, Woman, Other to hear about the lives of hard working women both inside and outside of London so I had a familiar voice with me while I ate alone, smelling strongly of weird packing adhesive and hand sanitizer.It wasn’t until September when I was able to go on my reserved holiday time that I could properly return to Middlemarch. I did so by finding the most socially distanced, quietest hole I could, jumping in it with about 10 days’ worth of supplies and getting stuck in. No internet, no phone signal, no other living human, just vibes. In that time, I read my largest chunk of the novel; finally, I had cracked into the damn thing and it was actually GOOD! Of course, I can’t be on holiday forever and unfortunately I had to crawl out of my hole and return to the cess pit that is the London Underground for the money that is found there. When I returned, I was right back into the foggy malaise which held me back from inhabiting Middlemarch like I had back in my lovely reading hole. Not only this, but I had also begun my MA course and had to catch up with a great dumping of Lit Crit that was set to be poured into my brain, and the deadlines of essays that needed to be poured out.It wasn’t until December leaned in its ugly head that I realised that I couldn’t bear the shame of carrying Middlemarch into the new year with me. Thank GOD for the third Lockdown (he says, his voice heavily laced with sarcasm), which gave me the time to slam the last few hundred pages of Middlemarch and walk freely into 2021. Well, apart from two other books I brought into the new year with me, and four others I won’t freely admit to, and lets not start with the audiobooks…But that’s essentially been my reading year, and even though I’ve read more books this year than I ever had in my life, I feel like I’ve not been reading at all. Like I said before, it’s hard sometimes to feel like you’re making progress, or that you’re not just wasting your time. This year has been a static motion of fast and slow, and through it all I’ve had to to keep telling myself that it’s worth it in the end; after all, Middlemarch was.t"
198,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/112077278-eliana,Rating 5 out of 5,"An absolute masterpiece from every angle. The intricate way George Eliot interweaves her many storylines together is incredible, and every character, and I mean every one, feels like a living, breathing person; I found myself sympathising with characters I thought I despised a minute earlier, and even the most minor figures feel complex and fleshed-out. The narrative is slow and relatively uneventful, but emotionally, it was riveting. Middlemarch is a hugely ambitious novel, covering every theme from the position of women to parliamentary reform; but though it focuses on only one town, the scope feels all-encompassing. Eliot's pearls of wisdom on the human condition are simultaneously insightful while hitting close to home, and she does all of this with such elegant grace and wit that only added to my experience. The relationship between Dorothea Brooke and Will Ladislaw in particular must be one of my favourite love stories in all literature, with romantic tension so thick you could cut it. There’s something very intimate in the way that Eliot articulates emotion—she makes note of the smallest of gestures; a tender smile, a fleeting glance, the way a hand is positioned. Her use of language was enrapturing. Dodo and Will were definitely my favourite; I loved their complex, passionate intensity of feeling, but I also enjoyed the scenes between Fred and Mary, as well as the absolute chaos that was Rosamund and Lydgate. I think it was when I started to feel sorry for Lydgate—seriously, Lydgate, who I'd absolutely detested for the past 700 pages, that I began to feel awed by Eliot's authorial power.Eliot is not interested in fleeting moments of heat and desire; she portrays genuine and lasting romantic attachments, relationships that are strong and real. She writes about marriage, in all its flawed glory, which I prefer to authors like Austen, whose novels end at the altar. There's nothing I appreciate more than books that have a kind of universal application, and if you can’t find yourself in Middlemarch (impossible!) you won’t find yourself anywhere.Dorothea is a character I would usually dismiss for being too varnished, too christlike, too perfect--but she fascinated me to no end, and I loved her. Her intelligence, 'love of extremes', and fierce sense of dignity & ambition was what captivated me at first, but following in Eliot's message, it was her character development that I ended up loving most of all. Absolutely, she makes mistakes, especially with regards to Causabon, but her unwavering feelings of duty and goodness were what truly captured my heart. Her deep nuance and inner complexity is what I feel is missing from so many 19th-century female characters—especially those written by male authors (looking at you, War and Peace). I adored Dorothea, and I'm relentlessly fascinated by her character.However, the latter half definitely felt superior; it took me over a month to get through the first half, but only four days to get through the second. Eliot’s dense and somewhat inacessible prose doesn’t help, and there’s a really boring stretch at the beginning after the narrative shifts away from Dodo and Causabon. For all its interesting ideas, it can be a bit of a slog (Bulstrode’s sections bored me half to death) and the sheer dullness of certain parts was probably the only reason I originally gave this four stars. But Middlemarch is a sort of slowburn; because despite being over 900 pages, I would have kept reading for far longer. It's witty, tender, solemn, heartfelt; and I agree with those who say that George Eliot is the only British author who can contend with Tolstoy. Next, Daniel Deronda!"
199,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32345761-abigail-bok,Rating 5 out of 5,"Middlemarch is one of those sprawling nineteenth-century novels with multiple plot lines and an entire village of characters—in fact, for the first several hundred pages it would be easy to mistake this for a portrait of the fictional village of Middlemarch. You get fifty pages devoted to one character and then he or she disappears off the page for a couple hundred pages while new characters and story lines are introduced. This can be a frustrating experience for readers trained up on the slimmer, more focused fiction of today. And on this second reading, I confess myself occasionally frustrated. “Enough with Lydgate!” I’d occasionally cry, tossing the volume aside.But that would be missing the point.First of all, there’s a leisurely pleasure to be found in taking the time to immerse oneself in such a novel. Many of the delights lie by the wayside of the plot, in the seemingly offhand observations on human nature. And then there’s the satisfaction (for a mind like mine that craves order) of seeing all the loose threads gradually being wound more and more tightly together. Of course, the real heart of the story—as it should be for any story, but often isn’t—lies not in the plot but in the themes: finding a balance between the competing claims of our obligations to ourself and to others; duty and desire; the true nature of happiness. Here “George Eliot” (in reality Mary Ann Evans Cross) boldly takes on the huge stuff and through all the sprawl her focus becomes more like a heat-seeking missile.There are moments when we catch a fleeting glimpse of the author behind the tale. Many female authors in the nineteenth century who aspired to greatness over entertainment preferred to take on a male pseudonym, but only in Eliot’s work is there a breadth of knowledge sufficient to deceive the reader into seeing this not as a “women’s novel” but as a novel tout court. Her grip on modern politics, languages, the classics, and the realm of ideas in general is astonishing to modern people who aspire to the title of “educated.” And her male characters are just as believable as her female ones, without being in any way similar in habits or cast of mind. Given the context of her age, I caught an occasional whiff of the showoff or at least someone with something to prove in her flights of erudition and in her fluency in the masculine world. Eliot is not about to confine herself to the feminine sphere.Nevertheless, the story begins with Dorothea Brooke, a spiritually ardent young woman likened in the preface to Saint Theresa. Dorothea is aflame with the desire to do something meaningful in the world, but she doesn’t know how to go about it. Her first attempt is pretty disastrous but she flounders on, with each setback purifying her ethical force till she burns like a flame off the pages. [Personally, I found the apotheosis of her character disappointing, but I understand it in the context of the age.] Dorothea is only one of many characters given their share of page time, and gradually we see Eliot building a series of comparisons and contrasts around different individuals and couples. My personal favorite characters are Caleb and Mary Garth, two of the most comfortable in their own skins. Regardless—all of the characters, even minor ones, are examined with an astute eye: Eliot is perhaps the greatest master ever (sorry, James Joyce fans) at rendering the psychology of a fictional person. Her sentences pitilessly lay open the weaknesses of her characters and then take us to a greater perception that brings mercy and understanding. It is an extraordinary experience to dwell in the presence of that mastery, and you should give yourself the time and space in your life at least once to savor that experience."
200,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2585926-stela,Rating 4 out of 5,"“…certainly, the mistakes that we male and female mortals make when we have our own way might fairly raise some wonder that we are so fond of it.”This quote summarizes the spirit of Middlemarch. This slight superior tone in which the auctorial voice keeps treating the characters, sometimes cordially ironizing them (“Mrs. Waule’s tears fell, but with moderation”), sometimes directly commenting their actions (“said Rosamond, with a great sense of being a romantic heroine, and playing the part prettily”), or revealing their thoughts and the community opinion of them in free indirect style (“Miss Brooke (…) was usually spoken of as being remarkably clever, but with the addition that her sister Celia had more common-sense”), always winking at the reader (“Mr. Rigg Featherstone’s (…) nails and modesty were comparable to those of most gentlemen,”) who is her steadfast accomplice in the creation of this complex web which is the provincial life in 19th century England.Without being truly biased, the omniscient narrator is never invisible, walking in houses and minds, finding general truths in the behaviour of the characters (“Destiny stands by sarcastic with our dramatis personae folded in her hand”), voicing ironic, sarcastic or only amusing opinions (“No speech could have been more thoroughly honest in its intention: the frigid rhetoric at the end was as sincere as the bark of a dog, or the cawing of an amorous rook”) that seem to justify their actions even when they are not. How sincere is, for example, the word “excusable” in the following? “Rosamond, in fact, was entirely occupied not exactly with Tertius Lydgate as he was in himself, but with his relation to her; and it was excusable in a girl who was accustomed to hear that all young men might, could, would be, or actually were in love with her, to believe at once that Lydgate could be no exception.” (m.u.)Built around two themes, matrimony and vocation, the novel follows mainly the destiny of three couples, whose sentimental and/ or professional choices lead to their happiness or their doom. In a Realist manner, a typology is established: Dorothea – the idealist, whose stubbornness is a little bit irritating in the beginning but who becomes increasingly interesting with her unaffected spirit of sacrifice and generosity, Mary – the practical, whose common sense will put her future husband Fred on the right path and Rosamund – the coquette, whose narcissism will be a cause of her husband’s failure. Even if women’s portraits are more complex, there is at least one memorable male figure – Lydgate, the young doctor so eager to discover new treatments and improve the medicine practice, defeated in the end by a mixture of bad choices and bad chance. The illusion of life, so forceful all along the narrative, is maintained, in the same Realistic spirit, by the Finale that succinctly informs about the characters life after the events, suggesting to the reader that their destiny is not over when the novel is over. Overall, I’d say, like Virginia Woolf, that Middlemarch was ""one of the few English novels written for grown-up people."""
201,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38875452-luca,Rating 3 out of 5,"George Eliot gives us insight into the lives of people from a provincial town called Middlemarch. The book is set around 1830, each of Middlemarch citizens leads a life that is very different from its neighbors and this makes it interesting to us as readers. 	To me, the value of this book lay with it being a work of realism. I find it incredibly interesting to read something that refers to actual events, tendencies, and feelings of a certain time. I think it is exactly those works of fiction that we classify under the term realism can offer valuable insights into cultural history. 	Furthermore, from what I can judge, the writing in this book was excellent. Eliot created her Middlemarch with much accuracy. There is an enormous amount of characters, who are all important towards the goal of creating the feeling of Middlemarch being an actual town. Yet, none of these characters feels underdeveloped. On the opposite of the spectrum, we have the danger of the book becoming awfully long and dull. Fortunately, this was not the case with Middlemarch. It is easy to distinguish who the main characters are and which characters are there mainly to complete the story, without it feeling artificial.	No matter how great I thought the characters were written, I found most of them absolutely awful. The exception being Dorothea, Will, Caleb Garth, and Lydgate. The other characters I could simply not relate to, probably because I find it hard to set my personal beliefs aside. I thought this book to be beautifully written, but the story itself was very plain to me, and I cannot get past the fact that much of what makes this novel significant for its time, is what makes this novel feel outdated to me. 	It could be that I have no particular interest in the novel’s main themes (provincial life, marriage, fortune etc.), but besides that, I found it an admirable book for its literary qualities, it did not make me overly enthusiastic. Concluding I would rate this book with 3 out of 5 stars, and I am still confident that this book is one of those books you must read some time throughout your life if you are interested in literary theory."

It's considered, of course, an all-time, must-read classic, and as such I respect it and certainly understand how people could love it; Eliot's writing is so under-the-radar clever. But I slogged to page 220, realized to my horror that I had 500 pages to go, and decided saying I had read ""Middlemarch"" was not the point; enjoying the experience was, and as such, and with the enormous remainder of the book glaring at me, I (*sniff*) gave up. The problem was (at least in the 30 percent I actually read!) that nothing really happened. This isn't necessarily a problem for me if the writing rivets me, but, sadly, ""Middlemarch"" didn't. I hereby pack it away in that corner called ""Boring Classics"", a place to which I hate to resign any book. I gave it three stars for importance and for generally strong writing, but I don't think I'll be returning to this world.There are a great many 19th-century novelists I like very much; perhaps I've been spoiled.

205,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2457095-apatt,Rating 4 out of 5,"After reading Silas Marner a few months ago and finding it quite beautiful and poignant I was quite looking forward to reading Middlemarch. However, after reading the first couple of chapters I felt confused and disappointed. The trouble was that after reading a few chapters I still had no idea what the novel is about. Certainly I could read the book’s synopsis which is easy to find but I really did not want to do that as I wanted to discover the story for myself. The impression I had was that the book is not really about anything George Eliot is just introducing us to a number of characters going about their daily lives and I was thinking why the hell would I want to read this? Still, I persevered as I usually do unless the book becomes unbearable. Fortunately this did not happen. I think the difficulty stems from the large cast of characters introduced early on in the book. It took me a while to familiarize myself with them and to understand their significance in the scheme of things. I was not even sure who the protagonists or central characters are. Gradually my persistence paid off and I managed to settle into the groove of the book and began to see the point of it. What the book is actually about is actually indicated in the book's full title Middlemarch: A Study of Provincial Life. The point is to experience the lives of several characters in the small town of Middlemarch. Once you know whose lives you are supposed to be focusing on that is. There are actually only a handful of characters of real significance. The foremost central character is Dorothea Brooke, the intelligent, kindly and somewhat naïve lady who made a hasty decision to marry the intellectual Edward Casaubon who happens to be a bit of a stick-in-the-mud. Then we have Will Ladislaw, an idle young gentleman who finds his purpose in life through the love of a good woman. Tertius Lydgate, a well meaning and ambitious country doctor who marries the rather silly airhead Rosamond Vincy and falls into more debts than he can manage.All these characters became quite vivid once I settled into the book, and the secondary characters became meaningful through their interactions with these few protagonists. The most salient theme of this book seems to be about bad marriages, hasty selection of a spouse on the basis of looks or qualifications. The mismatched marriages in this book quickly become dysfunctional and a lot of the drama ensues from these. Honor, dishonor and redemption are also major themes but I don’t want to elaborate on these because it would require many more paragraphs. By the end of the book I came to quite enjoy the character studies, though the book never quite moved me like Silas Marner did.One thing that I really appreciate through out the book, even from the beginning is the prose. Eliot’s prose is a thing of beauty and the dialogue often sparkles. Case in point, you know that old cliché  “Be careful what you wish for”? Eliot expresses it here as ""The thing one most longs for may be surrounded with conditions that would be intolerable.""  It’s like the tired old cliché has been turbo-charged. Sometime the author suddenly dispenses a bit of wisdom that made me stop and think. Like ""It was a question whether gratitude which refers to what is done for one's self ought not to give way to indignation at what is done against another."" Sometime she* beautifully expresses exactly what I often feel but lack the skill to articulate: ""It must be my own dullness. I am seeing so much all at once, and not understanding half of it. That always makes one feel stupid. It is painful to be told that anything is very fine and not be able to feel that it is fine—something like being blind, while people talk of the sky.""  In my case that is particularly true of books like Cryptonomicon and Blindsight, they are admirable books but I just do not like them, much to my chagrin.So by the end of Middlemarch I too managed to redeem myself and I can honestly say that this is a book well worth the effort of reading (a little patience may be required to begin with)._______________________________* George Eliot is the ""nom de plume"" for Ms. Mary Anne Evans."
206,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3831795-nelson-zagalo,Rating 4 out of 5,"“Middlemarch” é considerada uma das obras maiores do cânone britânico, indicado muitas vezes como representante máximo do período victoriano (corrente definida pelo reinado da Rainha Victoria, do Reino Unido, 1837-1901). George Eliot surge em qualquer discussão sobre este período, sendo incontornável, mas a acompanhá-la surgem também as irmãs Brontë, Charles Dickens, Lewis Carroll, Thomas Hardy ou Oscar Wilde, todos com direito a presença no panteão britânico, a Abadia de Westminster, o que dá bem conta da relevância deste período na história das letras britânicas.A relevância do trabalho de George Eliot reveste-se na abordagem realizada, na sua clara fuga ao romanesco pré-victoriano de Jane Austen, procurando construir algo mais íntimo, baseado no modo como as mulheres viviam esses tempos, como sentiam, e menos naquilo que a sociedade esperava dessas mulheres. Neste sentido o trabalho de Eliot é central porque abre caminhos pouco trilhados, permitindo às mulheres da sociedade reverem-se enquanto seres humanos, e não enquanto marionetas às ordens de regras sociais.Digo pouco trilhados, porque Eliot não foi a primeira a fazê-lo, e nem considero que tenha sido quem melhor o fez. Antes tivemos as irmãs Brontë que tinham começado este caminho, dando-nos uma das obras mais relevantes deste período, “Jane Eyre” (1847), capaz de afirmar a relevância da força interior da mulher, demonstrando que a mulher era muito mais do que a capa de bom-comportamento que a sociedade, nomeadamente masculina, lhe desejava reservar.Ainda assim Eliot destaca-se porque não se socorre de heróis nem dramas, apresenta-se com um verdadeiro sentido de missão, diria quase académico, em busca de respostas para o subtítulo, tantas vezes esquecido, “Um Estudo da Vida Provincial”. Eliot queria dar conta da vida à sua volta, mas da vida vivida, e não da sonhada ou desejada, e talvez por isso mesmo a sua obra surja mais massuda, de difícil leitura, por ausência de estratégias narrativas que envolvam e motivem o leitor. Isto é tanto mais evidente nos primeiros quatro quintos do texto, em que Eliot vai descrevendo o mundo e os seus personagens, secundarizando os eventos que laboram o enredo, para se concentrar na apresentação e credibilização do universo por si criado. Deste modo, é exigido ao leitor um esforço inicial, grande, para uma recompensa final que ainda que intensa, seja muito breve.Eliot passa a maioria da obra a descrever os universos que circundam os casamentos de Dorotea e Lydgate assim como de Mary e Fred, reservando para o final a entrada em força de Bulstrode e Ladislaw para unir tudo e assim contar uma verdadeira história, com conflito, progressão e objetivo. Mas talvez seja por esta insistência inicial em apresentar a vida, o mais próximo do que ela é, sem se focar em conflitos dramáticos mas antes no geral, que Eliot tenha conseguido passar a sua maior mensagem, de que o real não é fruto de vontade nossa mas de um conjunto de variáveis orgânicas que não podemos prever, nem impedir. Que por mais regras que criemos e imponhamos, o curso dos eventos encarregar-se-á de trilhar caminhos inesperados e incontroláveis. Tendo em conta este objeto, ou visão, muitos, nomeadamente ingleses, pretendem que Eliot seja o Tolstoi britânico, dando-lhe mesma a primazia. Não posso concordar, apesar de aceitar o paralelo, Tolstoi vai não só muito mais ao fundo desta visão do mundo, como acaso orgânico, como o faz entrelaçando muito melhor o contar de histórias, a criação dramática, com a filosofia, mais concretamente em “Guerra e Paz” (1863-8).A escrita de Eliot é muito boa, com uma prosa por vezes quase poética, e é isso que faz com que a leitura se torne menos pesada, mas precisava de ter procedido a mais algumas revisões do texto no sentido de encurtar a enorme introdução (4/5 do texto), ou então estender os eventos do último quinto aos restantes, para garantir um maior apoio ao esforço do leitor, e assim conseguir também tornar a sua visão mais clara.Publicado em VI: http://virtual-illusion.blogspot.pt/2..."
207,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1205030-susana,No Rating,"Mais um desconsolo...Quando uma amiga me disse que ia fazer uma leitura conjunta deste livro, fiquei entusiasmada e pedi para participar. Há já algum tempo que tento dar prioridade aos clássicos, sobretudo aos que tenho em casa. Fui buscar o livro à prateleira e ainda tive de abrir as páginas à faca!Ao início até me pareceu interessante, embora a tradução não me agradasse muito, mas a certa altura descobri, para meu desgosto, que esta edição não tem o texto integral, embora essa referência não se encontre em parte alguma do livro. Fiquei muito desiludida e decidi optar por ler no original, que pode ser descarregado gratuitamente, por exemplo no Projecto Gutenberg.Contudo, o texto original revelou-se bastante mais denso e a escrita pareceu-me algo pretensiosa, com frases de várias linhas e alusões pouco subtis com o aparente objectivo de mostrar conhecimentos e cultura. Mas esta impressão pode ser apenas consequência da minha pouca disponibilidade e falta dos ditos conhecimentos e cultura inglesa...Com pouco tempo disponível e sendo esta uma leitura conjunta, vi-me obrigada a voltar a esta edição, para poder acompanhar o progresso dos meus companheiros de leitura. No entanto, quando fizemos a nossa primeira discussão sobre o livro, percebi que as partes que aqui faltam são essenciais para a apreciação da obra, pelo que decidi desistir desta leitura, pelo menos para já.Assim, considero esta edição como lida (acho que 100 páginas é uma boa amostra), porque não tenciono voltar a pegar-lhe. Se desse uma classificação, seriam duas estrelas, mas acho que era injusto porque essa avaliação decorre da tradução e do facto de não se tratar do texto integral.Com muita pena minha, até porque tenho vários outros livros desta colecção, penso que estas edições da Romano Torres tiveram a sua época mas para mim já não servem..."
208,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38649248-anushka-malik,Rating 4 out of 5,"4/5 ★★★★☆This was one of the hardest books for me to finish this year and yet, I don't hate it or deem it less worthy of anyone's time because of it. On the contrary, I wholeheartedly believe that anyone who takes the time and patience to read this book and ponder upon the various characters and their motives deeply, will be all the better for it. The reason why I love english literature of the victorian era especially is the rare insight some of those writers had with regard to human nature. This book is a proof of that --I've never seen characters of a more varied nature and style, all interacting with each other on various levels to my delight and misery, as I have here. 𝙏𝙧𝙤𝙥𝙚𝙨 : Marriages with huge age gap, Widowhood, second love, misunderstandings between lovers, jealousy, class divide between lovers𝙒𝙧𝙞𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜 : 3/5 ★★★☆☆I might be a bit harsh in this regard because I've definitely given a higher rating to this same author for her book, 𝘼 𝙈𝙞𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙣 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙁𝙡𝙤𝙨𝙨. My reason for this being that that book did not run on for more than 800 pages. But to be fair, that book followed the story of one sad girl. And this book shows us the lives and love lives of four girls -𝘋𝘰𝘳𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘢, 𝘊𝘦𝘭𝘪𝘢, 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘢𝘮𝘰𝘯𝘥 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘔𝘢𝘳𝘺. In that light, 800 pages seem bearable but honestly, I was bored a lot of the time and wished the story would go faster. I played the audiobook at the speed of 2X or even higher a lot of the time. The only saving grace were the love professions made by Will, Fred and Lydgate to their respective beloved ladies. Those were undoubtedly 𝙝𝙚𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙬𝙧𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙝𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙡𝙮 𝙗𝙚𝙖𝙪𝙩𝙞𝙛𝙪𝙡. Romance of old has something in its favor that romance of today sadly lacks. 𝙋𝙡𝙤𝙩 : 4/5 ★★★★☆The plot was good. If you cut out all the ""verbose"" and judge the ""bare bones"" of this book, there is undoubtedly great merit and that is why this is a much celebrated book centuries after it was first published. There were all the different kind of love to be seen here, the instant love, the forbidden love, love that turned out to be infatuation, love that braved time and hardships and love that was naught but duty.There were the titled folk, the landed gentry, the businessmen and the new money. The plot really brought together all these different sorts of people together seamlessly owing to this age old mystery feud and matters of monetary intrigue. There was a death that couldn't be deemed a murder and yet the people attached to it were shunned as if they had been murderers. There was a young girl, barely of age, marrying someone old enough to be her grandfather and the society allowed it. Yet the same girl choosing her second husband of her own will had that same society judging her. I do like to see some good ol' hypocrisy in my stories because well, that's life. 𝙁𝙡𝙖𝙬𝙨 : I only really hated three things about this book. One, it should have been edited and cut down. It was too long and at times, rambling in nature. But I suppose it was the style of the writers of that time and that nation. Two, I h̶a̶t̶e̶d̶ 𝘥𝘦𝘴𝘱𝘪𝘴𝘦𝘥 Rosamond with a passion. I realize that the writer had probably intended for this character to be disliked by the readers and still, she served a purpose. She represented a certain class of women who had certain notions and views about life and how they wished to lead theirs. Yet, I couldn't 𝙝𝙚𝙡𝙥 𝙗𝙪𝙩 𝙛𝙚𝙚𝙡 𝙢𝙮 𝙗𝙡𝙤𝙤𝙙 𝙗𝙤𝙞𝙡 𝙩𝙤 𝙖𝙡𝙖𝙧𝙢𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙡𝙚𝙫𝙚𝙡𝙨 𝙚𝙫𝙚𝙧𝙮 𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙚 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙨𝙩𝙤𝙧𝙮 𝙞𝙣𝙚𝙫𝙞𝙩𝙖𝙗𝙡𝙮 𝙘𝙞𝙧𝙘𝙡𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙖𝙘𝙠 𝙩𝙤 𝙝𝙚𝙧 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝘿𝙧. 𝙇𝙮𝙙𝙜𝙖𝙩𝙚, 𝙩𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙛𝙞𝙣𝙚 𝙜𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙡𝙚𝙢𝙖𝙣 𝙬𝙝𝙤 𝙬𝙖𝙨 𝙘𝙤𝙣𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙣𝙩𝙡𝙮 𝙢𝙖𝙙𝙚 𝙢𝙞𝙨𝙚𝙧𝙖𝙗𝙡𝙚 𝙩𝙝𝙧𝙤𝙪𝙜𝙝 𝙝𝙚𝙧 𝙖𝙘𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙨! I, for one, never minded when the good doctor grew a backbone and gave way to his frustrations, yelling at his infuriating wife. But his misery is what he got for marrying a girl solely for her looks and outwardly charm. Three, I didn't like the fact that Will Ladislaw kept going back to the Lydgate's home even after the first time Dorothea saw him there. I understand that he was young and needed friends but he should have made a clear choice. Either make new friends or don't complain so much when the love of your life distances herself from you on that account. Ladislaw wasn't as strong a hero as I would've wished for, that's for sure. Dorothea was clearly too good for him, as Sir James repeatedly said. She was a veritable queen owing to her personal attributes alone, saying nothing of her fortune. 𝙋𝙤𝙞𝙣𝙩𝙨 𝙤𝙛 𝙚𝙭𝙘𝙚𝙡𝙡𝙚𝙣𝙘𝙚 : I loved how the writer could keep all the characters mostly true to themselves. There was never a point where I thought some character had behaved in a way unusual to them. There was character growth, yes but even that kept true to the core of each character as established early on in the story. Also, this was a realistic book and not an idealistic one. The ending that each couple received was exactly what they had deserved. There were no last minute miracles to come in and swoop the day. I liked that. It kept the story grounded and didn't cause a grand scene that would have been nothing except jarring to the readers after all that had happened. I liked that Mary Garth, the plain and sensible girl, had a happier and much deserved ending than the angelically beautiful and charmingly musical, Rosamond Vincy. I liked that Dorothea and Celia remained close sisters till the end. I must admit the first few chapters had made me fear that they might grow apart over time. I was glad to be wrong on that account. I loved Dodo and Kitten's sisterly bond more than anything despite how different in temperament and opinion the two girls really were. I'd like to jot down a deeper review of the characters but I have a feeling this review is long enough as it is. I might add a few lines in the future, maybe. 𝙊𝙫𝙚𝙧𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙪𝙩𝙡𝙤𝙤𝙠 : It is not a celebrated classic for naught. It had its moments when it pushed me to tears and I couldn't help but be moved with deep emotion. I'd recommend it to someone who has time, patience and enjoys relatively slow paced books somewhat similar to Anne Brontë's style mixed however with way more passionate and ardent declarations of love. ♡"

214,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6672056-plateresca,Rating 5 out of 5,"'I suppose we never quite understand why another dislikes what we like...'So don't bother talking to me about the faults of 'Middlemarch' :) I know it's longish, but one can listen to an audiobook (I personally prefer my hefty volume, — actually, I wish it were even heftier and contained some commentary on all those interesting references in the book which I otherwise had to google — but if it looks scary to you, do try the audio version!).This is (just) my second time reading 'Middlemarch', and I do think one has to read it more than once to appreciate all the subtleties. For one, there is so much foreshadowing in the beginning, — and you only see it if you've read up to the end once.E. g.: Lydgate ignores most of Farebrother's treasures, but admires a 'lovely anencephalous monster'. Lovely, indeed! 'Anencephalous' means 'characterized by partial or total absence of a brain.' 'That bitch', as a GR friend said in her review.The things that amaze me most about 'Middlemarch':- Eliot's kindness paired with a deep understanding of the human soul; there's a lot of humour in this book, but I can't think of any other author off the top of my head who would treat our follies with so much understanding;- the way the ridiculous in this book so often becomes terrifying, and the banal, life-changing, — all the while remaining very true to life.'Notions and scruples were like spilt needles, making one afraid of treading, or sitting down, or even eating.'Oh, I know this feeling so well! But it is a very multidimensional story; these notions and scruples do not come from an evil place at all.'...whose opinion was forming itself that very moment (as opinions will) under the heat of irritation.'Again, I'm sure this happens to me more often than I'd like to, — and this way of talking about it makes me very grateful to the author for pointing it out so nicely.I've written out a lot of quotes that speak to me, — and these are not all of the quotes I've written out, just some of the favourite ones:'And certainly, the mistakes that we male and female mortals make when we have our own way might fairly raise some wonder that we are so fond of it.''...that melancholy embitterment which is the consequence of all excessive claim.' Mr C<...>, indeed, had not thoroughly represented those mixed reasons to himself; irritated feeling with him, as with all of us, seeking rather for justification than for self-knowledge.'I can only wish all of this was less true!'He was ridiculously disappointed, as if he had imagined that her coming had anything to do with him.' — This might be one of the most precise descriptions of young love that I've ever seen :)'He distrusted her affection; and what loneliness is more lonely than distrust?''If youth is the season of hope, it is often so only in the sense that our elders are hopeful about us; for no age is so apt as youth to think its emotions, partings, and resolves are the last of their kind. Each crisis seems final, simply because it is new.'I know this because I have a teenage daughter :)'It always remains true that if we had been greater, circumstance would have been less strong against us.''But indefinite visions of ambition are weak against the ease of doing what is habitual or beguilingly agreeable; and we all know the difficulty of carrying out a resolve when we secretly long that it may turn out to be unnecessary.''Night and day, without interruption save of brief sleep which only wove retrospect and fear into a fantastic present, he felt the scenes of his earlier life coming between him and everything else, as obstinately as when we look through the windows from a lighted room the objects we turn our backs on are still before us, instead of the grass and the trees.'""In marriage, the certainty, 'She will never love me much', is easier to bear than the fear, 'I shall love her no more.'""'The bias of human nature to be slow in correspondence triumphs even over the present quickening in the general pace of things...''Foreseeing, to men of B<...>'s temperament, is often worse than seeing...'All of these quotes are about different characters, mind you. But I do feel like she's talking about me all the time. She was a great psychologist.'Only those who know the supremacy of the intellectual life — the life which has a seed of ennobling thought and purpose within it — can understand the grief of one who falls from that serene activity into the absorbing soul-wasting struggle with worldly annoyances.''... we are rather apt to consider an act wrong because it is unpleasant to us...'I guess I could go on, but let's stop it here. Bottom line: very deep, very well-written; exciting, funny, absorbing... Wonderful book."
215,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66348407-la-gata-lectora,Rating 5 out of 5,"En la región rural de Middlemarch viven algunas familias que no olvidaremos.Con la excusa de los sucesos que ocurren la autora nos hablará de temas tan interesantes como el matrimonio, el estatus, la riqueza, el amor, la ambición, la honestidad, el dinero, las relaciones humanas, la sociedad de esa época...Tenemos familias ricas en dinero que no lo son en felicidad, familias avariciosas a las que se les truncan los planes, familias humildes que son felices con lo que tienen, familias caídas en desgracia por buscar la felicidad, familias religiosas que esconden secretos oscuros, familias que conviven entre ellas a veces para bien y otras para mal, matrimonios por amor, matrimonios que salen mal, matrimonios que se apoyan en las malas...

Porque esto no es una novela para quedar bien, es sin duda una amplia crítica a la sociedad de la época victoriana, incluso a la misma condición humana. Middlemarch es una novela digna de estar a la altura de los grandes clásicos de la literatura y es una pena que no se conozca más.

In terms of raw command of craft, Eliot's piloting the Starship Enterprise through wormholes while so many of the rest of us walk around puffed up by our ability to tell the Computer to turn off the lights.I was ready for the religious aspects of this book to be on point, and they absolutely are—but nobody warned me about its sharp politics, or about Eliot's blistering sense of humor. I'm also impressed, and inspired, by her ability to use the building blocks of contemporary genres—the marriage plot, the secret heir—to create something far more intricate, complex, and powerful than the mere working out of genre machinery.And then there's the entire book as an exercise of narrative science, too, conditions controlled and carefully described, perfect moral experiments delivered with all the precision of a scalpel to the carotid.I feel like I could go on in this vein forever.

218,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9689213-lizbeth,Rating 5 out of 5,"I have been debating the best way to describe Middlemarch by George Eliot. I've come to the conclusion that it is written with a rare and deep empathy for humanity. Following several characters in a fictional town called Middlemarch, Eliot paints a vivid picture of all manner of life and captures its startling range from the ridiculous to the profound. The character of Dorothea is particularly fascinating as she changes more than any literary heroine I've met. The storylines are complex and masterfully executed. Eliot demonstrates not only her brilliance as a writer, but also her exceptional understanding of the human condition and the human mind. I wish I could have known her; she must have been an outstanding person. “Character is not cut in marble - it is not something solid and unalterable. It is something living and changing, and may become diseased as our bodies do.”"
219,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1254714-steve,Rating 5 out of 5,"I have no problem calling ""Middlemarch"" the British ""War & Peace"" (though there's no war). Where ""Middlemarch"" resembles W&P is in its epic (and penetrating) multi-character sweep. Refreshingly, Eliot avoids Tolystoyan finger wagging lectures on the meaning of History, though she does artfully insert topical issues that were the headlines of her day. But the heart heart of the novel are the characters, and the heart of the characters is Dorothea Brooke, who is one those rare fictional characters you never want to depart from. Dorothea is passionate, sometimes foolish (she's still very young), but ultimately wise beyond her years, and possessing a great heartedness beyond her wisdom. One of the greatest novels I have ever read. "

226,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/162117952-simone-invernizzi,Rating 4 out of 5,"Uscito dalla penna di George Eliot, pseudonimo di Mary Ann Evans, ""Middlemarch"" è una voluminosa e minuziosa opera di racconto della realtà di campagna inglese di inizio '800. Si tratta di un romanzo vittoriano non adatto a tutti però; personalmente lo consiglierei a chi nutre un particolare interesse verso questo periodo storico, nonché a chi ama i romanzi con strutture narrative un po' più complesse, incentrati su diverse storie e su svariati personaggi. La narrazione si svolge interamente in un medesimo, piccolo borgo di provincia, una comunità-cuscinetto in mezzo a due contee, un Middlemarch, appunto, come viene ben definita da Antonia Byatt nel saggio presente all'interno dell'edizione BUR.Trattandosi di ""uno studio della vita di provincia”, come indicato dal sottotitolo dell'opera, il romanzo è costellato di tutti gli elementi più tipici che la riguardano: nascite, morti, amori disgraziati, matrimoni e contratti, unioni infelici e frettolose, famiglie rispettabili, eredità, qualche personaggio dal passato oscuro che cerca grossolanamente di redimersi, e il ruolo delle donne, spesso tenute ai margini. Storie che si intrecciano ad altre, tutte legate all’ambiente di Middlemarch. Storie di un microcosmo locale e universale insieme, i cui personaggi principali sono essenzialmente due: Dorothea Brooke, fanciulla che desidera fare qualcosa di grande nella vita, ma che si ritrova infelicemente sposata ad un uomo colto e più anziano di lei di oltre ventisei anni, e il dottor Tertius Lydgate, accalappiato dalla vuota Rosamund Vincy, che sposerà e che lo porterà in un mare di debiti.. Sono due personaggi accomunati da un medesimo destino: vittime di scelte sbagliate e matrimoni frettolosi. Accanto alle loro storie si sviluppano poi anche quelle di Fred Vincy, fratello di Rosamund, che innamorato della bella Mary Girth cerca di fare il possibile per redimere la propria posizione sociale; e quelle intrecciate di Will Ladislaw e del ricchissimo Nicholas Bulstrode. L’impianto del romanzo è quello di una perfetta matassa di fili da districare, capitolo dopo capitolo: il lettore si trova davanti a storie che cominciano, vengono sospese, affiancate da altre, che vengono sospese a loro volta. E' difficile tenere sempre la concentrazione al massimo del livello per poter gestire tra le mani tutti questi fili narrativi, che non smettono di intrecciarsi. Alla fine però, quando il lettore avrà riannodato correttamente tutti i capi, si troverà tra le mani un bellissimo arazzo. Alcuni passaggi sono oggettivamente lenti, richiedono tanta pazienza, ma se siete motivati troverete il libro meraviglioso. L'autrice ci racconta come tema portante il crollo delle illusioni, e lo fa attraverso il percorso di vita dei diversi personaggi, riuscendo nel suo intento. Sì, cara Dorothea, sto parlando di te. Ti avrei presa a sberle all'inizio del romanzo, ma poi ce l'hai fatta a redimerti e convincermi che non tutto è perduto. Altro aspetto molto interessante di Middlemarch che ho apprezzato è quello legato alle nuove sperimentazioni della medicina, alle novità che Lydgate cerca di introdurre nella società nonostante uno sferzante conservatorismo. Egualmente apprezzabili i passaggi in cui si raccontano le vicende politiche dell'epoca, nonché le difficoltà giuridiche che gli inglesi dell'800 si trovavano di fronte quando si parlava di eredità.Unico neo, per quanto mi riguarda, è stata la mia incapacità di attaccarmi almeno ad un personaggio del romanzo. E' davvero rarissimo che io non faccia il tifo per qualcuno, o che non provi un po' di empatia, cercando di immedesimarmi con almeno uno dei personaggi presenti all'interno di un racconto. Ecco, nonostante abbia apprezzato il romanzo, non sono tuttavia riuscito ad affezionarmi a nessuno in particolare."
227,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22679327-david-huff,Rating 5 out of 5,"Is this a long novel? Oh, my yes. My edition is 802 pages, including a few footnotes.Is it set in an “old-fashioned” era? Well, it portrays life in a late 1820’s English town. HOWEVER, the insights it reveals, into so many aspects of who we are as humans, could have been written yesterday.Is it worth my time to read? If you want to savor and enjoy one of the finest novels ever penned, with a plot that, even for its era, has some real cliffhanger moments – absolutely!Author Lynne Sharon Schwartz has well said of Middlemarch, “Few novels in English – or in any language, for that matter – are as vast in scope, as ripe with wisdom, and as passionately imagined as Middlemarch …. (it) transcends localities of time and place: It offers life as we know it and feel it today, in our aspirations for love and work, our failings, our ambiguous successes and tragic limitations.”The various characters you will come to know in Middlemarch will resonate in your mind long after you finish the novel; they will make you laugh, and cry, stir your anger and frustrate you …. and, in some cases, will present wonderful examples of the goodness of which humanity can be capable. The story line is well thought out, and will keep you fully invested in the various subplots, as suspense and anticipation build over several hundred pages. I believe the most delectable treat of all, however, is the exquisitely beautiful writing of George Eliot (the pen name of author Mary Ann Evans). I don’t often highlight novels, but there are countless lines throughout that are so quotable, beautifully written, and rich with insight. They needed highlighting. A couple of examples, in closing:“By desiring what is perfectly good, even when we don’t quite know what it is and cannot do what we would, we are part of the divine power against evil – widening the skirts of light and making the struggle with darkness narrower”.“She (the town gossip) was the diplomatist of Tipton and Freshitt, and for anything to happen in spite of her was an offensive irregularity”.“I think his virtual divinities were good practical schemes, accurate work, and the faithful completion of undertakings; his prince of darkness was a slack workman”.“Souls have complexions too: what will suit one will not suit another”Set aside a block of time this year and enjoy this incredibly fine novel; you’ll find yourself immersed in a masterpiece."

Middlemarch is the stuff of nightmares, it is the place where the love for literature goes to die. It has left me with the unfulfillable desire to slap every single character in the face. First discovered in a 'books to read before you die' list, Middlemarch triggered my curiosity. I'll admit, the synopsis did not reveal greatness, but the countless 5-star reviews raving about interesting characters and engaging storylines did. Big, big mistake. I have forever lost my faith in people. Could it be just me and my lacking literary taste? I am not a sucker for action in a novel, but I do expect some evolving plot which does not seem to exist here. The book is too slow to hope for climax and the characters enraging (especially when they are in dialogue with each other, in perpetual snobbish catfights for no obvious reason). You will notice that I am not complaining about the wordiness of the writing or the 19th century mores and politics that shine through; these things are to be expected in a victorian novel (although they don't help make the case for Middlemarch). I caught myself dreading to come home after a long day at work just because it meant reading this book. I think this is it for me.To the unsuspecting prospective reader: please make sure you test-read at least one chapter of this book before committing to it. "

The greatest novel ever written in the English language and by far my favorite book now of all time. Nothing else compares. Nothing. Every character is completely believable, and we all know someone in real life who corresponds to each of them. Every page contributes towards the plot. Never in my life did I think that a 900 page novel about a town in England would quite literally have me riveted to the grand finale. Certain scenes, such as a key conversation or the reading of a last will and testament, had my heart pounding harder than any thriller I've ever read. Nobody will ever write a book like this again. How Eliot was able to write a massive novel with perfect prose, perfect characters, and where every single page counts, is incredible. There is no filler in this massive book. Every incident, every word breathed, is a piece of the larger story. Bonus notes: my two favorite characters were Dorothea and Featherstone. Featherstone, because I always love a rich old antisocial curmudgeon. You almost can't have an old Victorian novel without one. Honorable mentions also go to Will Ladislaw and Fred Vincy. My favorite novel of all time. A flood of emotion and brilliance from start to finish. Nothing will ever compare to this I fear. "

I can only imagine what the book would've looked like by the time I finished it. But I am so glad to have toughed it out. This book was incredible. Unlike the books of her contemporaries, this book had real people with real problems. There was love and heartbreak, of course, but there was also debt, gossip, and gambling. There were reputations to be gained and reputations to be lost.

233,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56831772-celia-x1fa90,Rating 4 out of 5,"Antes de empezar la reseña quiero decir dos cosas: 1. Aquí tenéis la reseña de la primera parte de la edición que he manejado, por si os interesa: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...2. No me atrevo a decir si esta novela es la mejor escrita, o no, de toda la historia de la literatura inglesa. No creo tener suficiente criterio o conocimientos para afirmar una u otra cuestión. Pero para servidora la mejor novela victoriana sigue siendo “La Feria de las Vanidades” de ese genio de las letras tan poco valorado a veces que es William Makepeace Thackeray. Y da igual que su historia este ambientada en el periódo napoleónico o de la Regencia Inglesa. Dicho lo cual ¿significa esto que “Middlemarch” no me haya gustado? Ni mucho menos. Con sus más y sus menos, tengo que reconocer que la he disfrutado durante la mayor parte de la lectura. Y que está increíble y superlativamente bien escrita, siendo un trabajo muy inteligente. Realmente es una maravilla para el lector ver cómo fluye y se detiene en los detalles que más le interesa la estupenda pluma de George Eliot. Como señale en la reseña anterior he leído críticas hacia esta novela de todo tipo y condición, algunas la ponen muy bien, otras horriblemente mal. Yo me encuentro en una situación intermedia que tira más hacia arriba que hacía bajo.Insisto, el libro me ha gustado y está muy bien escrito. Pero hay que reconocerle algo: con la mitad de hojas se hubiera podido escribir perfectamente la historia narrada de forma dinámica y sin que se perdiera para nada la calidad literaria. No era necesario que la autora se parase tanto en ciertas cuestiones y divagar sobre detalles, anécdotas y temas que no aportaba nada la trama y que al lector no le tenian porque interesar, incide demasiado en el mundo interior de sus personajes, en sus divagaciones filosóficas y en las descripciones. De ahí de que resulte una obra densa de leer, en la que muchas ocasiones la narrativa fluye o muy lentamente o directamente no lo hace. Y no voy a negar que en unos pocos momentos me he aburrido leyendo, porque sentía que la historia no avanzase. Pero ahí reside el reto que “Middlemarch” representa para el lector. Es un libro de ritmo narrativo lento, es imposible poder leerlo rápidamente o de una sentada, la propia forma de escribir de George Eliot lo exige, obliga al lector a dedicarle tiempo. Por eso mismo no es una obra para todo el mundo, y yo puedo entender que haya gente a la que no le guste. Es una de esas lecturas que en las cubiertas o las sinopsis debería llevar una advertencia sobre su lentitud. La verdad es que yo no he entendido las críticas en las que se decía que la novela se leía en un suspiro. Cuando pensaba en ello sentía como que si me hubiera perdido en el libro o realmente no me estuviera enterando de qué iba la cosa. Aunque tampoco entiendo otras reseñas donde se dice que en el libro no pasa nada. Pasan muchísimas cosas, especialmente en la última parte con todo lo relacionado con el pasado del banquero Bulstrode. Otra cosa es que sea un ritmo más o menos rápido.Otra cuestión que tampoco facilita mucho la lectura es la propia forma de encarar las cosas de George Eliot. A medida que se va avanzando con el libro uno se da cuenta de que nuestra querida Mary Anne Evans (la mujer de vida azarosa para la época que se escondía tras el seudónimo masculino de George Eliot) tiene unos objetivos personales muy concretos. No solo busca tratar de unos temas concretos, también demostrar su gran erudición y su enorme valía como escritora. Nada que objetar a esto, a la autora le sobra capacidad como escritora y conocimientos por los cuatro costados. Pero a veces he percibido que al tratar de mostrar su maestría con la pluma y lo que una mujer (o ella) es capaz de hacer, se extiende por las ramas en ciertas cuestiones, hace que todo se alargue hasta hacerse , a veces, muy machacón y denso. Si has leído hasta aquí te estarás preguntando cómo es posible que a esta tía le haya gustado tanto la obra, replanteándote si no le habrá puesto las cuatro estrellas por mero Postureo y para quedar bien y de intelectual sensible, porque se trata de un libro clásico. Pues porque realmente me ha gustado, lo juro. Me quito el sombrero ante lo bien que escribe, pese a todo, Eliot, la forma en que con pulso lento, pero firme y seguro, va componiendo ese fresco nítido, realista y vivido que es la ciudad de Middlemarch, y la forma en que crea una atmósfera de ciudad de provincias que envuelve, totalmente al lector. Me gusta mucho el costumbrismo y adoro la novela victoriana, y “Middlemarch es el ejemplo más puro y directo que te puedes echar a la cara de la novela costumbrista. Cualquier otra obra de este género casi parece un cuentecito donde lo que se narra se lee con la misma facilidad con la que que se bebe un vaso de agua y lo que sucede es de una ligereza pasmosa. Tiene cosas que se me han hecho bola, si, pero también momentos en que me lo he pasado muy bien leyendo. También creo que me ha beneficiado de que ya iba advertida de que no era una lectura para nada ligera, de ahí que me haya tomado las cosas con calma y ella tratado de buscar todo el rato los puntos más positivos del libro y no dejar que pudieran conmigo los momentos más densos. Es una obra colosal en contenido y continente. Pero Eliot sale bien parada gracias a su finura y a su enorme capacidad de observación. Y seamos sinceros: es muy difícil, por no decir imposible, tratar con cierta ligereza tantos y tantos temas como aparecen en esta novela, como las cuestiones religiosas entre católicos y protestantes; la lucha por la ampliación de la posibilidad del voto entre las clases medias y bajas inglesas; el matrimonio, el papel de la mujer; la educación; y la lucha de sexos y clases. Y sobre todo, es difícil tratar estos temas también como lo hace Eliot, mostrando las luces y sombras de los mismos. Es difícil resumir el argumento de “Middlemarch”. El subtitulo “Un Estudio de Provincias” es sincero y muy significativo . Estamos ante una novela que hace las veces de ensayo sobre como es la vida y la sociedad en una pequeña y ficticia población rural inglesa, en la que conviven diferentes familias y personajes de distinta posición social y suerte monetaria. A lo largo de más de 800 páginas, el lector será testigo de los cotilleos, rumores y desavenencias que flotan en la atmósfera de la población por disputas electorales, celos, herencias y disputas religiosas y sociales, que marcan el día a día de la comunidad. Hay muchos personajes, y todos ellos tienen su propio arco argumental. Cada uno de estos caracteres y cada uno de los hechos que les acontecen están íntimamente relacionados unos con otros. La propia trama es una tela de araña en la que todo está interconectado, lo que suceda a alguno de sus participantes acaba por afectar al resto. Es una de las cosas que me has me ha gustado de cómo está escrita la novela, la importancia que tienen todos sus personajes principales. Y también los secundarios, los cuales dan mucha vida a todo el argumento. La historia empieza con Dorothea Brooke y su búsqueda de dotar de significado su vida, como podría haber comenzado perfectamente con la llegada del doctor Lydgate a la provincia, o con los problemas económicos del joven y atolondrado Fred Vincy. Y estos son solo unos ejemplos del amplio y variopinto catálogo de caracteres que conoceremos a lo largo de la obra. Tantas páginas dan para mucho, y algo que no se puede negar es que cuando cierras el libro te da mucha pena haber abandonado a tantos personajes a los que es imposible no cogen cariño. Incluso los personajes más desagradables acaban por convertirse en viejos conocidos del lector, tal es la finura dices descriptiva psicológica de Eliot a la hora de esbozarlos.No obstante, como he dicho, Eliot empieza la obra con Dorothea, una joven acomodada que busca tener una vida significativa en su vida, por lo que acaba casándose con un clérigo frío y apático, que ha consagrado su vida a una obra sobre religiones antiguas que está destinada desde antes de su publicación a no servir para nada. Y es que, no hay que caer en el error de que “Middlemarch” es una novela romántica. Es cierto que el amor y las relaciones que genera ocupan un puesto muy importante en la historia, pero tratar de estos aspectos no es el principal interés de la autora. Éste se enfoca más hacia el matrimonio, hacia la importancia de que los cónyuges se conozcan bien y se apoyen el uno al otro para que éste prospere. Por medio de distintas parejas, Eliot hace una disección de lo que supone esta unión con todas sus luces y sus sombras, y de la importancia de elegir bien a tu cónyuge. Eliot pone en tela de juicio el romanticismo y la idealización, como dice ella “ El matrimonio, límite último de tantas historias, es además un gran principio”. Desmitifica totalmente el matrimonio, lo vuelve algo real y se aleja de la senda de otras escritoras como Jane Austen , las hermanas Bronte o Elizabeth Gaskell. También da una vuelta de tuerca al tópico de la esposa como ángel del hogar, ese concepto tan victoriano él. En “Middlemarch” las mujeres casadas aparecen como los personajes muy complejos e individualizados, no se dedican únicamente a velar por su hogar y su familia, tienen aspiraciones y miras fuera de las cuatro paredes de sus hogares. Como se ve en Dorothea. O en la egoísta y mimada Rosamund Vincy. O en la sacrificada Mary Garth. Todo esto le ha dado a la obra un plus de realismo que la hecho mucho más cercana para el lector moderno, permitiéndole conectar tanto con los personajes como con las situaciones que aparecen. También es muy interesante las relaciones que se han establecido entre los diferentes caracteres femeninos. En ese sentido tengo que decir que “Middlemarch” me ha parecido una obra bastante más adelantada y feminista que cualquiera de las obras de las autoras antes mentadas. En el sentido de que en ciertas he visto escenas situaciones de sororidad entre mujeres, algo que me falta en las obras (con la excepción de “Hijas y Esposas” de Gaskell) de las escritoras antes mencionadas. No digo que no fueran feministas, ni mucho menos (a ver quien le niega a “Jane Eyre” ser una de las primeras protagonistas feministas de la historia), sino, no creo que disfrutara tanto de sus trabajos. Pero el aspecto de la sororidad es algo que en estos muchas veces no encuentro claramente, y que he visto más nítidamente en Eliot. Volviendo a los personajes, ninguno tiene desperdicio por lo bien caracterizados que está. Todos ellos están muy individualizados y tienen vida propia. Pero tengo que decir que es en el personaje de Dorothea y en su arco argumental y emocional donde he encontrado el mayor ""pero"" que, a nivel personal, puedo ponerle a la novela. Dentro de lo que es esta obra tan coral, Dorotea al principio se perfila como la protagonista a destacar entre todo ese conglomerado de caracteres. Pero hacia la mitad de la obra, la autora se olvida de ella de muy mala forma hasta casi el desenlace. No da cierre a su historia hasta casi el final, y lo hace deprisa y corriendo, de mala manera .De esta forma se echa por tierra todo el proceso evolutivo que el personaje ha llevado acabo cuando su pluma se ha centrado en ella, el cual era muy realista y estaba muy bien llevado, siendo el más significativo entre todos los personajes que han aparecido entre las páginas de este libro. Y todo para que termine de forma abrupta y de una manera que no me parece mucho mejor a como empezó, quedando alineada por las ideas y metas de otro hombre, que tampoco me ha parecido mucho más digno de ella que el primero. Me ha parecido demasiado frustante para expresarlo con palabras, en serio. Y muy decepcionante cuando si algo ha quedado muy claro a lo largo de todo el libro es que a Dorothea no le falta ni carácter ni ideas, y además cuenta con una posición económica que le permitiría ser todo lo independiente que quisiera. Veo en ella un personaje lleno de posibilidades que Eliot ha decidido no concluir de forma satisfactoria. Por lo menos para mí. Y tampoco me he sentido feliz como acaban las cosas para el personaje de Rosamund (sin duda alguna el más odiado para una servidora en toda la lectura) y para el doctor Lydgate. Pero con esos dos no tengo ninguna queja de cómo se ha ido desarrollando su historia. Si no me ha gustado ese final es simplemente porque no me ha parecido justo para ninguno de los dos. Pero eso es algo totalmente subjetivo por mi parte por lo que he sentido por cada uno de los integrantes de esa pareja. Ya he dicho antes que es un libro muy realista, así que situaciones así son bastante esperables y solo permiten asentar aún más la sensación de que todo lo leído pudo haber pasado perfectamente.A modo de conclusión, debo de ir que empece “Middlemarch” Con miedos y prejuicios. Pero me alegro que las ganas que tenía desde hacía mucho tiempo de leerlo habían ganado la partida, al igual que el buen hacer de Eliot como escritora. No niego que la obra tenga sus fallos, que sea lenta y que sobren páginas. Pero hay algo que tengo que reconocerle: siempre que parece que se estanca , al final la historia vuelve a fluir y logra volver a atrapar mi atención. Eliot, por lo menos a mí, me lleva a un extremo agotador a ratos, pero no deja que pase de mucho más allá. Y eso es algo que he valorado muy positivamente y que me ha hecho muy llevadera la lectura. No tengo muy claro si es un libro que volvería a leer pasados unos años (aunque todo es posible), pero sí sé que me alegro mucho de haberme lo leído ya de una vez y de haber podido sacar mis propias conclusiones. Y que no va ser mi última aproximación a su autora (en las estanterías de mi casa, desde hace muchos años, hay esperando una bonita edición de “El Molino a Orillas del Floss”, que no para de hacerme ojitos…) Con sus más y sus menos entiendo la fama que ha tenido (aunque insisto: no sé si es para ser considerado el mejor libro escrito en inglés) y que siga ocupando un puesto muy especial en los corazones de los lectores por el encanto humano de sus personajes."
234,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus,Rating 3 out of 5,"[Reprinted from the Chicago Center for Literature and Photography (cclapcenter.com). I am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of CCLaP; it is not being reprinted illegally.]The CCLaP 100: In which I read for the first time a hundred so-called ""classics,"" then write reports on whether or not they deserve the labelEssay #68: Middlemarch (1874), by George EliotThe story in a nutshell:Written in the middle of the long reign of Queen Victoria but set at its beginning, Middlemarch by ""George Eliot"" (the masculine pen name taken by Marian Evans so that she'd be taken more seriously as a writer), published serially in 1872 and then as a single volume in 1874, is a sweeping and multifaceted look at a fictional town in roughly the center of England; so as such, it can be thought of in very similar terms to such modern historical television dramas as Upstairs Downstairs and Downton Abbey, an uber-story that tracks half a dozen interlocking small plots taking place among literally dozens of related characters. Chief among them is that of haughty wannabe intellectual Dorothea Brooke, who glibly blows right over a seemingly perfect romantic match with neighbor James Chettam to instead marry a doddering, antisocial professor named Edward Casaubon, because of believing that his perpetual work-in-progress The Key to All Mythologies must be brilliant (why else would it be taking him so long, after all?), and that it's important for her to marry a brilliant scholar so that she can actually learn from them; but then we also have the running story of young medical reformer Tertius Lydgate, his financial patron Mr. Bulstrode with a secret past, and the bad marriage he enters with Bulstrode's niece Rosamond Vincy; and let's not forget the adventures of Rosamond's brother Fred, headed against his will into a career in the church, under financial pressure from bad investments and in hot water with his childhood sweetheart Mary Garth; and then there are the efforts of Dorothea's father to enter Parliament as a radical liberal, the sudden appearance of a shady figure from Bulstrode's past, and all kinds of other digressions both large and small, the whole thing ending in good Victorian ""and then here's what happened to all of them thirty years later"" style.The argument for it being a classic:Middlemarch, its fans argue, mostly should be considered a classic because of the enormous effect it had on the shaping and maturation of the novel format itself; for while up to her time, novels had been seen as not much more than vehicles of escapist fluff for bored housewives and overactive kids, Eliot was one of the people in these years (along with Henry James, Leo Tolstoy, Emile Zola and more) to start bringing a grown-up sensibility to the medium, and to use the full-length three-act format to talk in a subtle and nuanced way about character, the human condition, and the latest political developments of the day. As such, then, it paved the way for the full academic bloom of literature in the Early Modernist period, and the development of all our current literary awards and university MFA programs; without writers like Eliot and books like Middlemarch, its fans claim, novels to this day might still be seen with the kind of juvenile disdain that we currently look at first-person-shooter videogames.The argument against:Ironically, the main argument this book's critics make is essentially the one its fans make, that Middlemarch was one of the first popular novels to introduce an academic sensibility to the format; but far from this being a good thing, they claim, it was instead a blow to what had been up to then an always fun and lively artistic medium, basically the first time in the novel's history that large amounts of people started having to say to themselves, ""When is this punishment finally going to freaking end?!"" And indeed, as much as this novel is loved (and believe me, it's much loved), there's still a large smattering of people at Goodreads.com who find this book an unreadable chore, and find it indicative of what's now an entire unfortunate wing of literature; and that's ""MFA literature,"" not to put too fine a point on it, the kind of banal yet convoluted messes that seem to be so inexplicably popular among the NPR crowd. Fine for what it is, these critics argue, that's still not enough to call it an undisputed classic that everyone should read before they die, making Middlemarch important historically but not a part of the official canon.My verdict:As I've come to realize while doing this essay series, even during the Victorian Age there were actually a whole series of different kinds of book lovers, and that writers of the period can be generally categorized like they are today based on what kinds of crowds they appeal to; so if you want to compare it to our modern era, you might think of someone like Charles Dickens as the Victorian Stephen King (massively popular among the mainstream, and with only a grudging respect among a few academic intellectuals), while someone like Mark Twain is more like Michael Chabon or John Irving (equally popular among the mainstream and academes), while Eliot here might be thought of more like John Updike, certainly with her mainstream fans but by and large only loved by college-educated fans of philosophy and political subtlety. And so while that absolutely makes Middlemarch the classic that its fans claim it is, a historically important and well-loved title that really did have a profound impact on the entire future of the arts, I have to confess that I myself was personally not much of a fan of it; and in fact, if you look at the various writers over the decades who have declared Middlemarch one of the most important English-language novels in history -- including Emily Dickinson, Virginia Woolf, Martin Amis and Julian Barnes -- I tend not to be much of a fan of any of these other writers either, all of them belonging to a wing of the arts that is absolutely a valid and important one, but just not my particular cup of tea. Definitely a title to pick up if you are one of these people, and certainly a undeniable classic that's worth trying out if you're curious about it, it can also be fairly safely skipped by those who feel like it wouldn't appeal to them. If you're feeling that way before even picking it up, chances are most likely that you're right.Is it a classic? Yes, but you might want to skip it anyway(And don't forget that the first 33 essays in this series are now available in book form!) "

237,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7240219-holly,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is a masterpiece.It's rather perplexing to me why Middlemarch has been relatively neglected as a part of the mandatory canon of classics. It often seems as if even the most bookish people haven't devoured George Eliot's masterwork. Even I wasn't that interested in making my way through this thousand-page tome until I read Virginia Woolf's praise of Eliot in A Room of One's Own. I always had Middlemarch pegged as yet another entry in the Repressed Middle-to-Upper Class People series, right alongside Austen, Forster, James, Wharton, and Anna Karenina.Eliot makes her peers look amateurish. She has an understanding of humanity unparalleled by anyone in her time, and she could even hold her own in the despairingly self-aware consciousness so prevalent in writing today. Her prose is gorgeous and lush, somehow both tight and breathy.She understands the humor of our insistence on order:
Notwithstanding her jealousy of the Vincys and of Mary Garth, there remained as the nethermost sediment in her mental shallows a persuasion that her brother Peter Featherstone could never leave his chief property away from his blood-relations:—else, why had the Almighty carried off his two wives both childless, after he had gained so much by manganese and things, turning up when nobody expected it?—and why was there a Lowick parish church, and the Waules and Powderells all sitting in the same pew for generations, and the Featherstone pew next to them, if, the Sunday after her brother Peter's death, everybody was to know that the property was gone out of the family?
the fragility of our emotions:
We mortals, men and women, devour many a disappointment between breakfast and dinner-time; keep back the tears and look a little pale about the lips, and in answer to inquiries say, ""Oh, nothing!"" Pride helps us; and pride is not a bad thing when it only urges us to hide our own hurts—not hurt others.
and the pain of our dashed dreams:
Here, with the nearness of an answering smile, here within the vibrating bond of mutual speech, was the bright creature whom she had trusted—who had come to her like the spirit of morning visiting the dim vault where she sat as the bride of a worn-out life; and now, with a full consciousness which had never awakened before, she stretched out her arms towards him and cried with bitter cries that their nearness was a parting vision: she discovered her passion to herself in the unshrinking utterance of despair.
in a manner that made me stop in my tracks and take a moment to breathe before continuing. At any given time, she can make you understand on a deeply personal level the motivations of both a self-righteous, senior-aged banker and a spoiled, delicate flower of a maiden; an aimless, ne'er-do-well chap and an ardent provincial lady; a bumbling, one-upping uncle and an ex-teacher who has found her calling as a wife and mother.Eliot knew that while humanity's playthings would do so, humanity would never change. We're still imputing large motives to small actions, our minds sprinting ten miles ahead of bodies, loving and losing, distressing and finding joy. This is what makes Middlemarch just as important in 2015 as it was in 1874."
238,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68337677-malum,Rating 5 out of 5,"Fantastic novel! Eliot's Middlemarch kind of reminds me of two other classics that I read recently. First, it reminds me of Gaskell's North and South in that there is a component of Victorian social justice involved. It also reminds me of Hardy's Far From the Madding Crowd in that it is largely about people making terrible relationship decisions. This book surpasses both, however. Unlike North and South, Middlemarch has romances and relationships that don't seem rushed and forced. And, unlike Far From the Madding Crowd, it doesn't get quite as dark and depressing. In fact, Eliot has a great sense of humor that still works almost 150 years later.The only other thing that I will note is that, obviously, the book is about Middlemarch. Now, a book largely about a place could either fall into the trap of being more about the place than any interesting character, or it could be more about the characters than the place. Eliot brilliantly blends the two, managing to have a whole cast of interesting characters, and yet giving Middlemarch a life of its own. When something happens, the town of Middlemarch has an opinion and reaction just as much as any of the characters. "
239,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,Rating 5 out of 5,"Never have I encountered a book that captures the feelings and emotions of a community. Some books capture an individual and their identity, some capture a landscape or a setting, some weave a beautiful plot line but this novel doesn't really do any of those things. Despite the fairly detailed character sketches you are still left wondering things about each of these characters and still made to ponder side plot lines and events. But you feel strongly that you are a part of this community and how the different players in the community interact and impact each others vantage points and lives. As someone who grew up in the military and never really knew anyone for a long period of time, I found that this novel was for the first time in my life a moment when I could see how a small community felt or what it would be like to be involved in other peoples lives and business over a lifetime. I can't say those interactions were always positive but it did give an interesting vantage point and something quite unique about the whole approach and the way these interactions played out which was enjoyable though perhaps slow in plot and pace.

It took a while to get through the initial 20%, but then I just got sucked into the world of Middlemarch, and man! was it a good journey. The characters are so well developed and real, complicated and multifaceted, their motivations - conflicted and unclear sometimes. Reading this was a breath of fresh air after a few books of black-and-white cardboard cutouts for characters.I found myself rooting for heroes, laughing out-loud and angrily kicking furniture - living their storms with them.

I ruffled the pages, smelled them, and sampled a few paragraphs here and there. And I started to read. Now, a few days later, I'm still reading and have decided I must be rereading Middlemarch.I forget when I first read this. Many years ago. I feel sure I'm a better reader than I was then, so it's not surprising that I found it wonderful again.

Shall attempt laterLater Attempt ( after a night's sleep)BR with Kru and a few others...Only Kru and I stuck to the end.This read was the culmination of my desire to read more classics and my adroit joining in of any BR planned.We started exactly in the middle of March , and my initial plan was to finish it off by March end. But the book had other plans.This should be my first unabridged George Eliot... beforehand I have read abridged versions of Silas Marner and the mill on the floss as a child, and didn't expect large , confusing sentences and meandering chapters.Not that I didn't enjoy.. sometimes there's nothing better than sitting in solitude and reading chunksters which ramble on.I was soon caught up in the life of the people of Middle March - mostly upper middle class folk keenly mimicking aristocracy .The two sisters Dorothea and Celia ( as different as ever) and their paramours , friends and relatives make up the story. Dorothea wants to do good and marries an ages parson, Mr. Casaboun, leaving the grounds clear for Celia to marry Sir James Chettam, who had his eyes on Dorothea. Casaboun is as dry as he is aged and soon lays untold restrictions in Dodo' s life. His nephew, Will Ladislau befriends Dodo.Rosamund is perhaps the most beautiful girl in Middle March and she soon ensnared Dr. Tertius Lydgate, a do gooder doctor with ideas of medical reform. Soon they realise the worth of the dictum "" Marry in haste, repent st leisure"".Rosy's brother Fred has set his eyes on Mary, who is plain in looks but beautiful at heart..who is also the centre of attraction to Mr. Fairbrother, a poor clergy . There is Mr. Brooke, Dodo and Celia's bachelor uncle who raised them, Mr. Blumstrom ..a blistering fellow who suddenly came into riches and has a chequered and hidden past.Middle March consists mainly of the actions interactions of these people, and a few more; and their consequences.I won't claim I thoroughly enjoyed the book; I was often cribbing at its slowness...but am happy that I read it."

Partly to absorb it all, as best as I could on my first read of it, and also partly because I didn't want it to end. George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans or Marian Evans or Marian Evans Lewes) became a wise observer and comforter. Her halts in the story to impart a wry but so true observation on humanity would give me pause as I pondered ""How does she know and see so much?"" It is sheer genius, talent, and with preternatural insight into humanity. From what I've read, Eliot was passionate about sympathy. She would be able to truly put herself into others' world views to gain understanding. She has captured humanity in all its pivotal moments in this book, during all walks of life. This quote on death, as Casaubon learns of a heart condition that might be fatal, just floored me.  When the commonplace 'We all must die' transforms itself into acute consciousness 'I must die- and soon', then death grapples us, and his fingers are cruel; afterwards, he may come to fold us in his arms as our mother did, and our last moment of dim earthly discerning may be like the first""  I went from intense dislike of Casaubon to have intense sympathy for the man. I read that Eliot was once asked whom she had in mind as the original for Casaubon, in response she silently tapped her own breast. Which has utterly changed my initial response to him and allowed me to see him as a deeper character. His failures and fears seem more understandable, more realistic. And perhaps Eliot had similar worries herself. How can anyone encompass all that this novel is in one review? I feel like it would be impossible and my own words are woefully inadequate."

How do I even write a coherent review for this brilliant piece of prose?! George Eliot is a master at characterisation, and that's what really made me give the book five stars. There were moments where I chortled out loud, exclaimed vehemently or just made many other reactive noises as I gradually got to know the larger-than-life characters. As I reached the last 100 pages, I became stressed about coming to its inevitable end. In other words, I bloody loved it. "
256,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1605591-christine,Rating 5 out of 5,"Eliot is one of those writers who I always forget how good she is. It’s not that I ever forget she is good, it is just that forget the high standard she has for most her work. The exception is Adam Bede, and this is no doubt because it was the first Eliot I read (thanks to Alistair Cooke). 	I first read Middlemarch in either college or grad school. I recently re-read because of a line in the New York Times Book Review.	To call Middlemarch feminist would be wrong, though in many ways it is proto=feminist. At the heart of the novel is the character of Dorothea and the idea of marriage. If Doretha was Catholic, she quite easily could have become a nun. But she isn’t, so the avenues opened to her are a bit slim. She wants to do good works, and to improve people’s lives. At beginning of the novel is she able to do this with a help of a suitor, a suitor she doesn’t know is a suitor, and later in the novel, she has the possibility to do it another way. This of course soon changes. 	The theme of the novel, in part, seems to be the idea of marriage for marriage does concern much of the part. At first, it is merely Doreatha’s marriage to Casaubon, who is older and who she hopes will teach almost like a father. Then it is the marriage between Lydgate, a doctor who wants to do good, and Rosamond, whose brother Fred forms part of a third marriage with Mary Garth.	The question of marriage is more a question what a good marriage is. Doreatha’s first marriage, really isn’t a good one. But it is not entirely her husband’s fault and in fact, very few of her friends (in fact only her sister and James Chettam) try to talk her out of it or express doubts about the marriage.	In many ways, the true right people in the novel are Mary Garth and Celia Brooke, Doretha’s younger sister. Mary is the dependable and intelligent daughter of the Gareths. She is prudent. The most imprudent thing she does is love Fred, who at the start of the book has a good heart but is a bit too much flash and imprudence. Celica is Doreatha’s younger sister, less religious, more sensual, but also more observant. She watches before she speaks. She may not be as good or holy as Doretha but she is not a bad woman. Mary too watches. This makes those two women better able to handle the society that constrains them.	Doretha is not able to handle society in the same way. Her marriage options are frowned upon whether she marries for the right or wrong reason. And unlike Lydgate, who marries an illusion, a pretty thing that he does not see as human or understand fully as human. He does not watch enough. Neither does Doretha at first.	Eliot’s suggestion that she is trying to write or example a modern life of St. Theresa is interesting because Dortha, like Lydgate, doesn’t quite come what she could have been.	Of course, that is, in part, the purpose of Eliot’s book, showing us the bonds – both prison like and fond – that society puts on us."

258,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56111743-roman-clodia,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is, in lots of ways, the quintessential nineteenth century English novel: a panorama of lives which cross the class, gender and economic divide.Eliot has a leisurely style but this allows her to get securely beneath the skins of even her minor characters and create men and women who we recognise, love, are irritated by, just as we are in real life.At the heart of the book are Dorothea Brooke, a beautiful idealist who just wants to do good but can't quite work out how; and her opposite, Doctor Lydgate, who also loses his direction in life. Both are ambitious, albeit in different ways, and both are, to some extent, thwarted and diverted. It's especially interesting that Eliot doesn't make them into a couple, and marries them each off to other people.There are many such parallels and similarities which play out in the book, moments of crisis, for example, where someone is tempted and has to make a decision which they then have to live with (Mary Garth, Bulstrode). But one of the thing I like about Eliot is that her books don't fall into predictable patterns: indeed, one of her themes is the endless potentiality of life which can turn on momentary decisions.For all her realism, Eliot is in tight control of her story and inserts a narrative voice into the text which draws on the specific to make general points about life.Eliot might not have the sparkle and wit of Austin, or the gothic intensity of the Brontes, but she's supremely intelligent and not afraid to show it."

And then mid-March rolled around and I thought, what better book to read in the ides than Middlemarch?Middlemarch touched me as deeply as it did in my first reading just over six years ago. My life has changed considerably since then, with many ups and downs but in all changes that would please anyone as much as the finale of Middlemarch. Reading my past through the eyes of Eliot yielded some unexpected connections. I still credit it as a favorite novel, and as an excellent choice for anyone to read who is considering marriage.In my re-readings I have been trying to be dutiful about marking my favorite passages, because too many times have I turned to a beloved book trying to find That One Spot and not been able to locate it. I used up a whole sleeve of 100 page flags in Middlemarch. I find so much of past Melody in young Dorothea. I love Eliot's wisdom and her piercing look at character. Middlemarch still brings me great peace as I read it. The Garth family continues to be one of my favorites in all of literature. The little glimpses into their family should be their own book; I wish Fred and Mary had more page time on their own. For a while I was loath to keep calling Middlemarch a favorite when I'd only read it once. Now I know it is one that can accompany me on the journey of life."

I can only share my own experience. First, this is a book you really need to commit to, and know that it will pay off in the end. The first half felt quiet and slow. There are a lot of characters, with invisible strands all connecting them in different ways. Some characters only encounter each other a few times throughout the book, yet have huge impacts on each other's lives. It truly is a picture of small-town English life: the concerns, the class, the distinct lives lived out parallel to one another in completely different socioeconomic spheres. It is also a story of the hopes and dreams of young people who are rudely awakened to reality, mostly upon marriage. How does one go on living, when one's most idealistic values become unattainable, because of the choices one has made? It's striking to me how little people have changed. The conflicts and beauties of human relationships from nearly 150 years ago still exist today, and so the novel still spoke deeply to me. It's one I hope to revisit in the future."

Not solely in a spirit-of-the-time sort of way but in a universally human one. The same communication breakdowns, conflicting motives, misdirected emotions, misguided actions and character flaws plague the denizens of George Eliot's far-reaching tome as they do a modern audience. -- Seriously. It's funny.-- Dodo. Fucking Dodo, man. How a character can go from being such an insipid little pill to one of the novel's most compelling forces... it's breathtaking. George Eliot juggles a massive cast comprising dozens of intricately crafted personalities to paint a sprawling, immersive collage of one provincial town. It is ultimately worth the pushing through the odious beginning: Consider it the necessary cost of admission. The ride gets really good once Dorothea finally starts gaining some dimension and direction. "

270,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56448875-may-skelton,Rating 5 out of 5,"Sometimes the grandest dramas play out on the smallest of stages. George Eliot’s Middlemarch is a beautiful tale of provincial life in 19th century England, exploring the complexities of class, religion, and marriage. What seems as if it should be a quaint and prosaic community becomes the setting of a sweeping, riveting drama in Eliot’s masterful hands. While Eliot’s writing can become slightly turgid at times, the intricately crafted plot of the novel is incredibly engaging, filled with surprising twists and turns and unexpected connections. We are all humiliated by the sudden discovery of a fact which has existed very comfortably and perhaps been staring at us in private while we have been making up our world entirely without it.In my opinion, though, Eliot’s greatest strength as a novelist is in not her ability to craft plot, but in her remarkable understanding of human nature and relationships. The characters she creates are beautifully drawn, and feel like living, breathing people—complicated, compelling, and often rife with contradictions. Like real people, Eliot’s characters are utterly endearing at times and infuriating at others, existing in that messy but oh-so-human ethical realm somewhere between saint and sinner. Even Eliot’s antagonists are fascinating, realistic, and morally gray, and I often found myself struggling to reconcile my revulsion at their actions with a deep sense of pity for their suffering (self-inflicted though it often was). I found Mr. Causabon, in particular, to be a striking figure of extreme ambiguity. I was horrified by his attempts to bridle the vital, generous spirit of Dorothea, to punish her for his own all-consuming insecurities, and to make her a fellow captive in his mental prison of narrow hallways and winding staircases leading nowhere. And yet I found that at other moments I felt nothing but pity for this insular man of great and yet completely unrealized ambitions, spending all of the hours of his solitary life working on an outdated, esoteric theory destined to be unfinished, unloved, and ultimately forgotten by history, just as the man who wrote it. A miserable husband Causabon may have been, but the quiet tragedy of his life did not fail to touch me. It is an uneasy lot at best, to be what we call highly taught and yet not to enjoy: to be present at this great spectacle of life and never to be liberated from a small hungry shivering self—never to be fully possessed by the glory we behold, never to have our consciousness rapturously transformed into the vividness of a thought, the ardor of a passion, the energy of an action, but always to be scholarly and uninspired, ambitious and timid, scrupulous and dim-sighted.While Middlemarch is filled with fascinating characters, a few stand out to me as being particularly memorable. Dorothea Brooke is a wonderful protagonist—strong-willed, intelligent, and passionately feeling. She is often carried away by the intensity of her emotions and blinded by her ideals, swept up in her latest grand philanthropic plan or overwhelmed by her intense desire to help the people around her. She is a character whose heart is full to overflowing, whose soul is constantly reaching out hoping to find connection or provide succor to the weak. And while her earnest, ardent, and idealistic nature sometimes lead her to make foolish decisions, the purity of her intentions makes it impossible to judge her for it. Certainly the determining acts of her life were not ideally beautiful. They were the mixed result of young and novel impulse struggling amidst the conditions of an imperfect social state, in which great feelings will often take the aspect of error, and great faith the aspect of illusion.Although he plays a less prominent role in the novel, another character I grew particularly fond of was the pure-hearted, humble Caleb Garth. It would be almost impossible to imagine a man more honest and kind than Caleb, the manager of several estates in Middlemarch and father to five children. Caleb is hard-working and fair, the type of man who has the utmost integrity in all areas of his life. Never one for grandstanding or long speeches, he doesn’t preach his ideals. Instead, he truly embodies them, living them in his own quiet way on a day-to-day basis. He is almost always affable and easygoing in his relations, but unflinching in his adherence to his own code of ethics. He fulfills his duties not just for compensation or praise, often offering his services free of charge, but because he honestly believes that his efforts can help to better the lives of his friends and neighbors. He works tirelessly and enthusiastically, and is entirely devoted to his stern but adoring wife and affectionate brood of children. Caleb is generous and down-to-earth and fundamentally good in a way that rarely receives the recognition it deserves, but is profoundly moving nonetheless. Caleb was a powerful man and knew little of any fear except the fear of hurting others and the fear of having to speechify.While Eliot clearly has a gift for creating characters that are intriguing as individuals, where she perhaps shines the brightest as a novelist is in the relationships she crafts between them. Eliot had profound insight into the complexities of interpersonal dynamics, as well as the rare ability to reproduce the slightest nuances of social interactions with a degree of veracity and detail that is striking. There is something very intimate in the way Eliot makes note of the smallest of gestures—how a hand is positioned, a fleeting glance, a timid smile, a tender touch. It is worth mentioning, too, that the variety of relationships depicted in Middlemarch is vast, kaleidoscopic in both nature and tone. The romantic relationships in the novel alone range the entire emotional spectrum, from blissful, rapturous love to playfully combative affection to resigned but disillusioned loyalty to openly disdainful antagonism. Middlemarch contains not only some of the most deeply romantic interactions I’ve ever read, but also some of the most uncomfortable and just plain unpleasant quarrels imaginable. And for me, it is this incredible diversity of interpersonal dynamics—all depicted with equal care, precision, and authenticity—that makes the novel so poignant. I will return to this book again and again for the passionate words that linger unspoken between Dorothea and Will for years, making the silence heavy with meaning. I’ll return to it for the painfully real portrait of naked disdain between Rosamund and Lydgate, the tension so thick you could cut it with a knife, the seemingly perfect marriage unravelling bit by bit until little is left but scorn and disappointed expectation. But perhaps most of all, I’ll return to it for Mary’s tender mocking of the hapless but earnest Fred, for the image of an umbrella-ring placed around Mary’s tiny finger as a child by a devoted, wide-eyed little blonde boy, for the story of the often foolish but always faithful mayor’s son who never outgrew his childhood love of the peasant’s daughter. Marriage, which has been the bourne of so many narratives, is still a great beginning, as it was to Adam and Eve, who kept their honey-moon in Eden, but had their first little one among the thorns and thistles of the wilderness. It is still the beginning of the home epic—the gradual conquest or irremediable loss of that complete union which makes the advancing years a climax, and age the harvest of sweet memories in common. Middlemarch isn’t a quick and easy read—it is long, and Eliot’s somewhat dry prose can be a bit inaccessible and slow-going at times. But I promise you that it is worth all of the time and effort. Every minute I spent with the inhabitants of Middlemarch felt like a gift."
271,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,Rating 5 out of 5,"I've come to a realization: Charles Dickens is not my favorite Victorian. I'm 50/50 on Anthony Trollope so far, and this was only my first George Eliot, but the two of them are just so much better than Dickens when it comes to describing fully-realized human beings of both sexes. Not that Dickens isn't good at what he does, which is comic, poignant melodrama with a social edge, but his characters are just not real. Not like the inhabitants of Middlemarch.On the other hand, there was none of Dickens' epic scope in Middlemarch. This is an English country drama, all centered around the town of Middlemarch. There are no high stakes or ultimate questions of human morality, just a bunch of characters struggling to get by and navigate the consequences of their ideals, their pasts, their prejudices, and their bad choices.Our cast includes Dorothea Brooke, an idealistic, pious young lady who was born to be a sainted martyr. Full of charity and self-sacrifice, she manages to find a way to martyr herself — by marrying a dour, much older clergyman named Edward Casaubon. She dreams of devoting herself to his studies, being the selfless angel at his side.""Could I not be preparing myself now to be more useful?"" said Dorothea to him, one morning, early in the time of courtship; ""could I not learn to read Latin and Greek aloud to you, as Milton's daughters did to their father, without understanding what they read?"" She practically throws herself at the bemused Casaubon, not because she feels anything like romantic passion, but because living a life of the mind devoted to waiting on her husband's every need seems like the closest thing to Godliness to her. You might think this makes Dorothea an aggravating character, yet Eliot portrays her as honest, willful, altruistic, and intelligent, her only flaw being that she lives in a world that's missing a few of the shades and colors that everyone else can see.Meanwhile, a bright young surgeon named Tertius Lydgate comes to Middlemarch, full of the latest medical knowledge. Unfortunately, Middlemarchers are a hidebound lot with their own way of doing things and they don't need no ""foreign"" (i.e., anyone from any place more than ten miles away) physicians coming here with their newfangled ways. Lydgate makes a few friends, but he also steps on a few toes and soon is enmeshed in the politics of an English country town whether he likes it or not. Is it this or his marriage to Rosamund Vincy which is his real downfall? Eliot lays the groundwork for this good man to screw himself over in a multitude of ways while never really doing anything wrong other than being a bit lacking in foresight.But once again, she creates complex characters who could just be caricatures (and if written by Dickens, would be) yet manage to come to life as people you can sympathize with. Rosamund, for example, is shallow, self-centered, and materialistic. She pretty much manipulates Lydgate into proposing to her, and from then on the poor man is trapped. When his career doesn't take off, their finances go south, and Rosamund experiences buyer's remorse, I really, really felt sorry for Lydgate. But amazingly enough, even though Rosamund made me gnash my teeth, I didn't hate her. Because Eliot takes pains to make her understandable.But Rosamond was not one of those helpless girls who betray themselves unawares, and whose behavior is awkwardly driven by their impulses, instead of being steered by wary grace and propriety. Do you imagine that her rapid forecast and rumination concerning house-furniture and society were ever discernible in her conversation, even with her mamma? On the contrary, she would have expressed the prettiest surprise and disapprobation if she had heard that another young lady had been detected in that immodest prematureness—indeed, would probably have disbelieved in its possibility. For Rosamond never showed any unbecoming knowledge, and was always that combination of correct sentiments, music, dancing, drawing, elegant note-writing, private album for extracted verse, and perfect blond loveliness, which made the irresistible woman for the doomed man of that date. Think no unfair evil of her, pray: she had no wicked plots, nothing sordid or mercenary; in fact, she never thought of money except as something necessary which other people would always provide. She was not in the habit of devising falsehoods, and if her statements were no direct clew to fact, why, they were not intended in that light—they were among her elegant accomplishments, intended to please. Nature had inspired many arts in finishing Mrs. Lemon's favorite pupil, who by general consent (Fred's excepted) was a rare compound of beauty, cleverness, and amiability.She's not mercenary, she's not mean, she's not evil. She's just making the best bargain she can, with a realistic assessment of her own worth, given the options available to a Victorian woman of her class. Love, like money, is something that's just supposed to happen when you follow the rules.This thirty-two-hour audiobook got me involved in the lives of the Brookes and the Vincys and the Garths and the Bulstrodes and the Casaubons and all the other families of Middlemarch. It's a great big multi-family melodrama, with marriages and deaths and money scandals, and each character impacts all the others in some way. There is no villain here and nobody is really evil, though some characters are selfish or foolish or obnoxious, so all the conflict results from mundane things - bad marriages, jealousy, misunderstandings, fecklessness, and other human foibles.It's something of a Victorian soap opera, but an elegant and intricate one. If you like Victorian writing and character dramas, Middlemarch is a masterpiece. Maybe it doesn't have quite the profundity of Dostoevsky or the poignancy of Dickens, but will I read George Eliot again? Heck yeah! 4.5 stars, rounded up."

274,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20773991-holly,Rating 5 out of 5,"I must admit, I haven't read a Victorian novel in such a long time. This was the first in a long list of Victorian novels that I want to read soon (hopefully before Christmas). Middlemarch is a long, rambling story of a typical provincial town, with the typical marriages and deaths and scandals. People describe it as a book about the whole of society: the rich, the poor, the ladies, the gentlemen, the farmers, the bankers, the bachelors, all rolled into one. It provides a lovely oversight of Victorian towns, and Eliot creates this by intertwining three threads of plot: the change in Dorothea from a girl fascinated by knowledge to the lonely Mrs Casaubon, the fall of Lydgate due to the gossip of society, and finally the doomed love between Mary and Fred, that cannot happen because of Fred's hideously awful attempts at keeping money.If you don't know already, George Eliot is a pseudonym for Mary Anne Evans. She simply wouldn't have gotten published if she retained her actual name, hence it was published under a male pseudonym. This was also used by Jane Austen and all three Bronte sisters. I think the fact it's written by a women is painfully obvious, but adds a nice, pleasant feeling to the read. If you think of Pride and Prejudice, it's a decent length book, but when you think about it, doesn't have much substantial plot, apart from the occasional marriage and minor downfall of characters. This is very much the same with Middlemarch. I'm not saying this is a bad thing at all, it allowed Eliot to explore society through everyday life. She used the connections between people and the surrounding historical contexts to highlight how society really works.I said that it was a pleasant novel, but there is the undertones of the harsh reality of society. You have Bulstrode's dark past, thrown light upon by Raffles dying talk. You see the harshness of marriage. Dorothea changes from a wonderful girl admiring a man due to his expanse of knowledge, to a widow accepting she will never marry again, and is restricted by her late husband to never marry the man she loves. It's painful, seeing characters evolve, but it's also builds a very clear picture of society. That's why you don't get frustrated with it's length (a whopping 880 pages), because each sub-plot is intertwined so wonderfully that you feel like the society is laid out on a platter, for you to see each microcosm of the impacts of events and personalities. It does lag in the middle, with nothing much happening. Nothing substantial ever happens. You have deaths, you have scandals, but these are almost swallowed up by a move to another sub-plot, or a long, rambling speech about a part of society. To that extent, it can be seen as weak, especially after reading plot-packed, more modern books.Eliot also have the favourable help of hindsight. She wrote this between 1871 and 72, yet set from 1830-32. It allowed her to see the impacts of vast changes. It was set in pre-Reform England, but Eliot had the advantage of living in post-Reform England. You also see her narration pop through the plot. Occasionally, you see the usage of 'I', making Eliot almost an omniscient being. She knows what happens, she knows the characters pasts, and the future of society. We also hear about the death of King George IV, his successor, and the pathways being made in medical science, but also the want to stick to traditional ways. The wide expanse of characters allows for many different views on a lot of different events and themes, making it a very contextual novel, one that enlightens the Victorian period amazingly. It's ultimately a realist novel, but has elements of a modern novel we know today.It's a long read, you have to put up with long rambling narration (the worst I've seen so far is in Les Miserables), but it paints a truly wonderful picture of society in the 1830s, and is so clever in it's weaving of plot threads, it's a truly enjoyable read, regardless of it's length. I do, wholeheartedly agree with Virginia Woolf's comment on it: 'the magnificent book that, with all its imperfections, is one of the few English novels written for grown-up people'."
275,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7295702,Rating 5 out of 5,"http://diavazontas.blogspot.gr/2016/1...Διάβαζα το Middlemarch σχεδόν ένα μήνα τώρα, και θα ήταν ψέμα αν έλεγα πως δεν ένιωσα ανακούφιση όταν έφτασα στην τελευταία του σελίδα. Κάποιες μέρες ήταν βάσανο για μένα η ανάγνωση, κάποιες άλλες ατελείωτη απόλαυση. Το Middlemarch, το μυθιστόρημα-ποταμός της George Eliot, το αριστούργημά της, εκδόθηκε το 1871, μετά το θάνατο του Καρόλου Ντίκενς, και μοιάζει σαν να απαντά στα δικά του μυθιστορήματα, σαν να είναι ο αντίποδας στην κοσμοθεωρία του. Το Middlemarch γραμμένο από μια γυναίκα που χρησιμοποιούσε αντρικό ψευδώνυμο για να μην υποστούν τα γραπτά της τους συνήθεις περιορισμούς, είναι μια μεγάλη ηθογραφική αφήγηση, ένα μυθιστόρημα πλοκής και χαρακτήρων, αλλά ταυτόχρονα μοιάζει και σαν διακήρυξη. Οι ήρωες της Έλιοτ προσπαθούν να ζήσουν σύμφωνα με την κοινωνική συνθήκη και αποτυγχάνουν, κάνουν γάμους μίζερους και δύσκολους, δυσκολεύονται να βγουν από τις συμβάσεις, δεν μπορούν να ζήσουν ευτυχισμένοι μέσα σε αυτές. Κεντρικοί χαρακτήρες, από την μια η Δωροθέα Μπρουκ, μια πολύ όμορφη και προικισμένη κοπέλα, που από πείσμα του χαρακτήρα της παντρεύεται τον γέρο εφημέριο Καζομπόν, γιατί τον θεωρεί λόγιο και νομίζει πως θα την αφήσει να τον βοηθήσει με τις μελέτες του. Δίπλα του ζει μίζερα- ήδη από τον μήνα του μέλιτος, είναι σαφές πως ο Καζομπόν, γεροντοπαλίκαρο ως τότε, δεν μπορεί να της προσφέρει τίποτα, ούτε καν στοργή. Όταν δε εμφανίζεται στο προσκήνιο ο ανιψιός του, ο Λειντισλόου, ο Καζομπόν ζηλεύει τόσο, που βάζει όρο στην διαθήκη του, η Δωροθέα να τα χάσει όλα, αν παντρευτεί τον ανιψιό του μετ�� τον δικό του θάνατο. Από την άλλη, έχουμε τον γιατρό Τέρτιο Λιντγκέιτ, ένα ιδεαλιστή και κάπως αφελή, επιστήμονα, που εμφανίζεται στο Μίντλμαρτς, και παντρεύεται την πιο όμορφη κοπέλα, την Ρόζαμουντ Βίνσυ. Εκεί αρχίζουν τα προβλήματά του, η Ρόζαμουντ έχει τα μυαλά πάνω από το κεφάλι, τον μπλέκει σε χρέη, τον αναγκάζει να δανειστεί από τον τραπεζίτη Μπάλστροπ. Εντωμεταξύ η πελατεία του συρρικνώνεται, γιατί ο Λιντγκέιτ επιμένει να μην δίνει άσκοπα φάρμακα. Ο αδελφός της Ρόζαμουντ, ο Φρεντ Βίνσυ είναι ένας άσωτος νεαρός που τζογάρει και χάνει χρήματα που δεν έχει, κι είναι βαθιά ερωτευμένος με την μάλλον άσχημη, αλλά εξαιρετικά έξυπνη και ηθική Μαίρη Γκαρθ. Η Μαίρη, θα τον πείσει πως δεν κάνει για το ιερατείο, που τον προόριζαν οι γονείς του, θα τον βάλει να βρει μια τίμια δουλειά, για να του υποσχεθεί πως θα τον παντρευτεί.Στο φόντο δουλεύουν τα ιστορικά στοιχεία, η περίφημη πολιτική αλλαγή του 1832, η θρησκεία, η μετάβαση από την αριστοκρατική σε μια νέα εποχή, οι κοινωνικοί περιορισμοί και φυσικά η θέση της γυναίκας. Στο πρόσωπο της Δωροθέας Μπρουκ, μιας νεαρής που βλέπει ως μόνη διέξοδο για τις πνευματικές της ανησυχίες έναν αταίριαστο γάμο, ενσαρκώνεται όλη τη δυσφορία των γυναικών της εποχής, που δεν θέλουν να ασχολούνται μόνο με δαντέλες και κρινολίνα. Αλλά και με την μυαλωμένη Μαίρη Γκαρθ, την μόνη που βάζει όρους, αλλά κι αυτής που ξέρει να αγαπά, η Έλιοτ δίνει μια άλλη εκδοχή της θηλυκότητας, σχεδόν στον αντίποδα της πανέμορφης, κομψευόμενης και εντελώς ρηχής Ρόζαμουντ Βίνσυ. Τα χρήματα, οι σπουδές, η κοινωνική θέση, η ομορφιά, καθορίζουν εν πολλοίς την μοίρα των ηρώων της. Η Τζωρτζ Έλιοτ γράφει κάπως πιο στριφνά από τους συγγραφείς της εποχής της, δεν χαϊδεύει τα αυτιά, ούτε τα νεύρα του αναγνώστη· θέλει γερό στομάχι για να τελειώσεις το Μίντλμαρτς. Όμως, όταν βγεις από την περιπέτεια, και σταθείς κάπως μακριά από το βιβλίο, λυπάσαι πια που έφυγες από τον κόσμο του. Γιατί οι ήρωες του Middlemarch είναι από αυτούς που μένουν μαζί σου για πάντα."

I never have been one for distasteful remarks, but I desire you to understand that I did not consign it to the depths unmarked, but only after I had added several of my own punctuation marks: a smear here and a bescumbering there from my great, guttural old bottom!What can a rantallion Londoner know about life here in our unassuming county, and what can a man such as yourself know about the inner workings of the delicate, luscious female mind? In your future printings I hope—nay I threaten—that you will stick to what you know (you wrote well, if simply, about the workings of the stutterous, lumbering political machines of our times, and of the infernal devices of the newfangling doctors trying to change the way we heal our ill; it shall remain leaches for me, for they have not failed in easing my varicosity nor black dog nor ablepsy nor scrumpox yet!) and leave the rest of your dribblings in your inkpot.The baser instincts in me want for nothing but to enrage upon the many misrepresentations you have perpetrated and perpetuated upon my own body and soul—the very idea that I am a church bell gossiper or a spreader of rumors about like so much manure!, the idea that I would step out of my own duty as wife to a godly man! But I digress. It is not for myself that I shall be enflamed. The matter at hand is that of Mrs. Casaubon, whom your dreck has made out to be such a figure of divine beauty, of saintly mercy and wholesomeness and integrity.To that I say, balductum! The miss is no doubt fanning her farts more merrily into our faces after your portrayal of her, but I and the Middlemarch Committee for the Correction of the Imbecilic would together like to inform you that you have been gravely and ludicrously erroneous. Dorothea Brooke was from the beginning a twit and a twat. Her sister Celia is a gibface and a ninny, and their uncle a buffoon and a foozler. I know firsthand from my brother's sister-in-law's nephew that Dorothea was deflowered before her wedding night by the same young artist—I can hardly bring myself to utter his awful name, but I can tell you for sure that lad is NOT lawful, being a con artist whom our dear Farebrother fingered selling punctured sheepgut sheaths and thus responsible for the plague of young, motherless rapscallions running around our fine county today—the same young artist that you laud and halo in your jollocking tome. You've gotten everything right wrong and everything wrong right.I speak for every soul in Middlemarch when I say this: keep your malmsey nose out of our town and our business. That is all!Warm regards,Mrs. CadwalladerP.S. Your prose and insight holds no candle to that of Edward Bulwer-Lytton. He has sadly passed on but perhaps you could seek out his maid or his cur for advice in your next literary endeavour. "
277,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7053537-suzanne,Rating 5 out of 5,"Middlemarch is perfect. I loved it! Why can't I write a review? Well, for one thing, every time I look back, I replay the whole wonderful experience. I think back to St Theresa in the prelude. I giggle about Dorothea, a wannabe martyr, being pegged by her younger, sage sister. as Dodo, because she, Dodo, ""enjoys giving up."" I love the Garth's and Vincy's middle class families which connect and disconnect as families usually do. Rosamond is the ultimate ""material girl"" with a good temper, but very indulged. The rectors, Casabon and Bulstode are as despicable as Mr. Farebrother is giving,fair and Christian. The doctors, including arrogant and dedicated Lydegate ,are of course, concerned with treatment, kickback from pharmaceuticals, and reputation. Will Ladislaw is a devoted hunk who is both artistic and artful, but is of questionable birth and lacks direction. He is a foil to Fred Vincy who is decidedly middle class, but barely graduates from clerical college, has no calling and literally can not write as well as a 9 year old.Their community, Middlemarch, circa 1820, is very similar to the ours. There are the good, the bad and the rich. Some of the rich, the Brooks orphans and their uncle, are quite wonderful . They are quirky and generous. In contrast, Casaubon is ridiculous, jealous and vengeful while Bulstrode believes that wanting to be good is the same as being good. But I digress . This community includes the gentry, a middle class which is always struggling, but getting by, and an invisible lower class, which depends on the largesse of others . Every time I think about this integrated group of characters and interweaving of plots of deceit and control, I stop and think of the perfect prose. I highlighted over 50 times. Eliot out Austened Austen with her witty, sometimes snide views of marriage, family and religion. You would think that a woman who had a married lover, was estranged from her own family and only married a few years before her own death to a man 20 years her junior, would not care that much about tradition or the institution of marriage. She did. She called marriage ""a noose"", but also a way to give direction to floundering Fred. In fact, marriage was mentioned in every chapter . I can't possibly select a few examples of Eliot's sparkling words, but believe me, Eliot's strong narrative voice and her character's honest dialogue is remarkably modern and 19th century at the same time. It is clear, descriptive and poetry. I can't just revisit this novel, this town, without wanting to stay. I want Dorothea to befriend me and tell me the truth because she is a heroine who always speaks her mind. Middlemarch is far away and long ago and home."
278,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30099981-james-ferrett,Rating 5 out of 5,"“Character is not cut in marble - it is not something solid and unalterable. It is something living and changing, and may become diseased as our bodies do.” Middlemarch is the perennial favourite of well-read parents, and my mother was no exception to this. This guaranteed that I would do everything I could to avoid this book in my teenage years, and as adulthood began to creep along I somehow merely forgot it existed. This year, after reading a number of the looming geniuses of 19th century England (and having discovered that the writing there was, unsurprising to everyone but me, bloody good), an essay by the incredible Zadie Smith emphasised just how special this book is to her and should be to others. So, I decided to finally give George Eliot a go.I began reading and thought: ""Okay, so Middlemarch has one of the best-written opening paragraphs in fiction. Not a bad start."" I kept reading. ""Right, so Middlemarch has one of the most gorgeous opening pages in fiction. This is a great start."" I kept reading. Three weeks later, after forcing myself to take the novel slowly—I wanted to savour the experience—I was in love with Middlemarch in a way I have been in love with very few books. Yes, that's a melodramatic way of describing how certain books can make you feel. In my experience, it's also an accurate one. The omniscient narrator gives us a birds-eye, all-encompassing view of life which only 19th century novels can pull off with such lightness. I've recently become fascinated with authors who can truly create multiple personalities within a single novel; David Mitchell and Susan Barker are great examples of this rare talent, but if they're chameleons then George Eliot was a shape-shifter. Young, old, handsome, homely; poor; rich; there's no one Eliot can't write fully fleshed. She was absurdly talented at expressing the intricacies and individualities of humanity, and she did so without demonizing those who held views likely extraordinarily different to her own. This is by far the least plot-driven book to sit on my favourites shelf; the actual events are small scale by design. That small acts can have huge implications for those we live with is one of Eliot's central conceits, but this means it's difficult to express what makes this book special succinctly. George Eliot describes this feeling of the gap between experience and explanations better than I can, unsurprisingly. Near the end of the novel, Celia asks Dorothea to explain just how a surprising relationships came about: ""Can't you tell me?"" said Celia, settling her arms cozily. ""No, dear, you would have to feel with me, else you would never know."""
279,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/412902-jon,Rating 5 out of 5,"A friend of mine, when asked why he didn't write anything himself, responded by asking why he should publish anything when there were still so many people who hadn't read Middlemarch. I knew what he meant by that, but now I really know what he meant. This is one of the books that just gets it so completely right in so many ways that writing a review that really does it justice is, for me, fantastic delusion.The characters are awesome and George Eliot does a complicated thing in making us, if not completely care for, at least understand where each person is coming from. We prefer stories with characters we like and dislike, but here it becomes really hard to dislike any of these people. Even the less than cool people become understood and while we wish they would change some habits and characteristics, we see why they are that way and are able to be more generous or charitable towards them. It seems to me that the more time you spend with a person and the more you get to know them the more difficult it becomes to dislike them - yes, even with Casaubon & Bulstrode. But Eliot reminds us that we can never completely know who a person is, because we misread people all the time, seeing them differently than they are and never knowing all the details that make that person who they are or explain events and actions surrounding them. Plus we all just think and see the world differently; how does a community where everyone has a different view of the world properly function?I might be making the book sound really dull, but it's not. The characters are incredibly fascinating; the language delightfully quotable; the ideas deeply resonating; the sincerity of the author profoundly moving. While it seems fair to say that Eliot is trying to too rationally examine and explain humanity, but the result of her study is so awesome that it seems a trivial complaint. The book is brilliant and instills a hope and faith in people that cynics like me need to hold on to."

This three-star rating may rise to four, once I think a bit more about its subtleties. There are many pleasures here, and lots to love: the ironic and cutting humour; the wonderful characters - Mrs. Cadwallader and Mr. Brooke almost Dickensian in their idiosyncrasies; how they evolve over time and the way your opinion of them does too. And of course, thematically it's a treasure trove.But I have to say, this thing was too often a slog, dragged down so frequently by an intrusive, pedantic narrator who oversold the point. A very smart goodreader - Kelly? Miriam? - once said that she appreciated authors who gave their reader credit and space to connect the dots. Georgie Girl doesn't give that to her readers: whether she is her narrator here or not, I felt a distinct lack of trust of the reader. I was left feeling that it was more important for GE to be the smartest one in the room, showing off her vocabulary, her classical education and her breadth of feeling, than to let her characters do that for her. Also - word to the wise: the Notes in this Penguin Classics edition were truly terrible. Literal and non-illuminating. (Completely the opposite of the Notes in Bleak House in the same series).Back with more later, or happy to discuss in the comments!"

I think I've only given a brilliant rating to the Count of Monte Cristo and Bleak House. This is a fascinating character study of the people of Middlemarch, a town in Victorian England. I can't even begin to try to describe the story -- there is Dorothea who makes a dreadful first marriage to an older man, Dr. Lydgate and his disastrous relationship and marriage to the self-centered Rosamund, Fred Vincy and Mary, and much much more. The way the author pulls her story and characters together is incredible, and the insight into the characters is nothing short of brilliant. To quote from the book jacket and Virginia Wolf ""one of the few English novels written for grown-up people."" Just be warned, this is not a sit on the edge of your seat, can't put it down until it's finished type of novel. This is a story to savour and enjoy the multi-faceted characters and the author's glorious prose like a fine red wine or a box of chocolates (or both). If you are looking for high action and adventure, this is not the book for you. Highly recommended for any lover of 19th century English literature, not as dark and brooding as Hardy can be, but the prose is just as lovely, if not better. "

Ook George Eliot steekt immers wel wat humor in haar boek. Maar na een tijdje moest ik toch mijn eerste indruk herzien. George Eliot is veel gedetailleerder in haar personages (en de sociale klassen), in het tonen van de samenleving en de relaties onderling. Ze is ook een stuk meedogenlozer tegen haar personages.Het resultaat is een knap weefwerk, waar je dankzij het taalgebruik dat nog steeds modern genoeg aanvoelt, en uiteraard ook dankzij de lengte van het boek, helemaal ingezogen wordt.Ik twijfel tussen 3 en 4 sterren, maar uiteindelijk ga ik voor 4 omwille van de nuance waarmee de personages geschetst zijn, zelfs een oppervlakkig personage zoals Rosamund krijgt voldoende uitdieping. (Over Dorothea zwijg ik even, dat is een halve heilige, maar dat was nu eenmaal het punt zoals het einde mooi bewijst). "

I didn't finish the book.It is well written and interesting mostly, but it takes forever to say anything ...Just doesn't hold my attention long enough to enjoy it.Maybe some other time. (June 2013)Well it is now ""some other time."" I'll start reading this in January 2106 -- looking forward to it. Finished on my second try for reading. I'll admit to skimming some parts of the story and that it took a long while before I was invested in the characters -- the first 50% of the book seems to take forever, but after that I wanted to know what happens to the people of Middlemarch that I had grown to enjoy reading their stories. The last 50% of the book flew by for me. "

The cast of characters is huge, which isn't bad in itself, but unfortunately the people Eliot is writing about are so bland and boring that it makes literally zero difference to me whether they live or die. Yes, there is excellent psychological insight, and some interesting analysis on human behavior, but the repetitive, bland descriptions and forgettable dialogue make this an exhausting read. With two hundred pages left I couldn't bother finishing it."

Moving it here so I can find it more easily.)(It's about the ending of the book, so I suppose I should put up some kind of spoiler warning, but I don't think I can spoil it. In fact, I think I can only enhance it by revealing the ending and letting prospective readers know that it is, indeed, worth getting there.)A little history here -- I saw the BBC Middlemarch on Masterpiece Theatre before I ever read the book, so I got to hear Russell Baker's commentary before and after each episode. After the last episode, he said something along the lines of this: generations of readers have felt vaguely disappointed by the ending of Middlemarch, and wished that Eliot had somehow been able to get Dodo and Lydgate together.I don't remember what else he said because I was shocked. Of course Dodo and Ladislaw belonged together! Ladislaw was HAWT. And Romantic. What else could a girl possibly want? (I was 22, let it be remembered).Reading the book shortly thereafter did not change my mind.Fast forward 11 years to this past Christmas. I was on the phone with an old friend who had finally gotten around to reading the book (inspired by my gushing long ago). She hated the ending. Her points were these:* Clearly, Eliot intends the reader to think Ladislaw is a much better catch than any sensible modern reader would think he is. He's self-absorbed and mediocre. All Dodo's wants and ambitions are subordinated to his career. She should not have married him.* Dodo should have married Lydgate.* The ending, therefore, is either lame or tragic, or more likely both. If you fall in love with the wrong person, you are pretty much doomed to limp along, never achieving what you might have, and that's just depressing.Oh dear. It had been so long since I'd read the book, that I had no rebuttal. What she said made sense to me, and made me worry that this book I had loved so long was, in fact, nothing but a big disappointment. That's one of the reasons I leapt at the chance of reading it again, with other people! I needed to know which was right -- her pessimistic reading, or the rosy interpretation of my youth.I have concluded NEITHER.This time through, I like the ending. Not in a ""how romantic, they're together!"" kind of way, I mean, and not without a certain somber understanding. It's not a buoyantly happy ending for Dodo; not happy at all for Lydgate. Fred and Mary fare a bit better. But let's have a look at what Eliot is trying to say.One of the big themes in Middlemarch, to my mind, is how to make peace with your ordinariness. Everyone wants to be special: Fred wants to be exempt from work; Bulstrode wants to be part of God's elite, without having to follow the rules himself; Lydgate wants to make a big splash in the medical community; Rosamond wants to rise in society; Casaubon wants to do exceptional scholarly work. (The exception to this, it seems, are some of the peripheral characters -- Celia, Sir James, Mrs. Cadwallader -- who are extremely interested in keeping everything exactly as it is. Similarly, much of conservative Middlemarch society).Inevitably, characters who strive for, long for, and chase after specialness run up against setbacks and disappointments. There are good ways and bad ways to deal with setbacks. Our bad models include Bulstrode (who bribes, cheats, and possibly hastens death), Casaubon (who hoards and hides), and Lydgate, who basically gives up (we can debate this, if you like). There are two significant good models: Farebrother (who I've discussed before), and Caleb Garth. Caleb's strategy is especially instructive: he works hard. Success comes only slowly, specialness perhaps never, but that doesn't really matter. Work is its own reward. He never stops moving, and he never stops believing in work for its own sake.Work is one thing that saves us from despair in the face of obstacles: love is another. Fred and Mary have both, and I think they end up the happiest. Lydgate ends up with pale shadows of both, and I think his fate is unambiguously tragic.Then we have the problem of Dodo. She is presented from the beginning as special -- and she is. She is kind and courageous, able to step forward and save Lydgate when no one else (even my dear Farebrother, *sob*) will do it. Under the right circumstances, she could have been St. Theresa. But these aren't the right circumstances, and the question Eliot asks in the ending is Is that a tragedy? Is it enough to marry someone you love? Is it enough to work diligently at the myriad invisible, unappreciated tasks of everyday life?I think it is. I think Eliot thinks so too. We work, we love, we do our best, and we can't let the specter of how much better we could have done (maybe! under the right circumstances!) recast our stories as tragedies. Dodo's story is still worth telling. So is yours.Let me just end with the very end, barely remembered from my first read-through, that now gives me chills: ...[For] the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who have lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs."

294,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108566677-ruud,Rating 5 out of 5,"”It is an irony that the author of the most brilliant literary study of marriage written in English was a woman whose unorthodox romantic partnership excluded her from polite society. Mary Ann Evans, who took the pseudonym of George Eliot when she began publishing fiction, lived for twenty-four years with George Henry Lewes, a philosopher, journalist and critic, whose open marriage to his wife had already resulted in her bearing another man's child.”De morele afkeuring in die tijd van zo’n “verbintenis” ging zo ver, dat haar broer, Isaac Evans, het contact verbrak toen ze bij Lewes ging wonen en erop stond dat hun zussen hetzelfde zouden doen. En ook Warwickshire, waar Eliot de eerste dertig jaar van haar leven doorbracht verwelkomde haar niet meer. Die streek voorzag haar niettemin van de herinneringen van het leven in de provinciale Midlands die haar publiek in hoge mate waardeerde… Tot zover uit Jennifer Egan’s interessante voorwoord bij mijn versie van Middlemarch.”Miss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into relief by poor dress. Her hand and wrist were so finely formed that she could wear sleeves not less bare of style than those in which the Blessed Virgin appeared to Italian painters… ” … en dat gaat nog even door met prachtig lyrische zinnen, dus BAM!, zo’n openingszin komt binnen, ik zit gelijk rechtop, zeker na een korte prelude over het leven van St.Theresa die Spaanse vrouw die meer dan 400 jaar geleden leefde maar die zeker niet de laatste was van haar soort dus: wie is dat wezen en wat wil ze? Nu, aan wil ontbreekt het niet in deze roman, vooral niet bij de meer opvallende vrouwelijke protagonisten en dat in een tijd waarin de vrouw eigenlijk een bijrol placht te spelen.Ik begon hieraan met een mengeling van nieuwsgierigheid en tegenzin, immers 19de eeuwse Engelse literatuur leek me op grond van een aantal BBC-series niet echt m’n ding, in de grijze oudheid had ik ooit “Wuthering Heights” gelezen waaraan ik nauwelijks meer herinnering had dan aan Heathcliff. En dan die 831 pagina’s minuscule tekst. De roman begint (en blijft!) heel beeldend en sfeervol maar de mengeling bleef voorlopig, want met de eerste - zeg 150 pagina’s - had ik beduidend meer moeite dan met de rest, vooral vanwege de buitensporige relatie tussen de jeugdige Dodo - afgaande met die ontmoeting in het Romeins museum met de schilder, Lydgate’s vriend, moet zij een haast goddelijk innerlijke schoonheid hebben bezeten - en het fossiel Edward Casaubon (”He distrusted her affection; and what loneliness is more lonely than distrust?""), waarvan ik me met de beste wil geen voorstelling kon maken (fonkelende glans versus asgrauwe dofheid, maar ja … andere mores hė rond 1830 én St.Theresa!).Wat mij verder opviel in deze roman waren:. De tekening en psychologisering van zo vele verschillende karakters, waar vooral Dorothea Brooke, Mary en Caleb Garth en Camden Farebrother op mijn sympathie konden rekenen en aan de andere kant van dit spectrum Peter Featherstone (een soort Ebenezer Scrooge) en de slechterik-pur-sang John Raffles, maar zeker ook de hypocriete bankier Bulstrode die z’n gehele gezin meesleurt in z’n val.. De ambities en vergissingen die tot catastrophes leiden en vooral die van de overspannen verwachtingen in het huwelijk, één van de kernwaarden in Middlemarch … Volgens de overlevering was de schrijfster zelf verre van moeders mooiste, terwijl George Lewes bekend zou hebben gestaan als 'de lelijkste man van Londen' met de bijnaam 'aap'. Toch, volgens Kathryn Hughes' biografie van Eliot, vormden deze twee fysiek onvolmaakte mensen een rijke, monogame, seksueel bevredigende verbintenis. Volgens Eliot zou schoonheid dan ook een afleidend risico zijn, getuige Lydgate’s huwelijk met Rosamond, wier schoonheid en oppervlakkigheid hem een ​​vreselijk huwelijk opleverde en Rosamond een belemmering op haar innerlijke groei.Verder spelen op de achtergrond van al die persoonlijke betrekkingen politieke, sociale en technologische veranderingen een beduidende rol. De politiek betreft de Hervormingswet, die in 1832 werd aangenomen en de koopmansklasse een grotere vertegenwoordiging in het parlement gaf. Ook verhit de aanleg van een spoorlijn de gemoederen met voor- en tegenstanders. Terwijl Middlemarch de provinciale vermoedens ten volle uitspreekt dat het landschap zal worden verscheurd ten behoeve van de stedelijke rijken, kiest Eliot de kant van de vooruitgang, zoals beschreven door Caleb Garth, de stem van de rede in de roman. ”Somebody told you the railroad was a bad thing. That was a lie. It may do a bit of harm here and there, to this and that; and so does the sun in heaven. But the railway's a good thing.”Met zo’n 900 pagina’s tekst is nog veel meer te vermelden, maar ik laat het hierbij. Of je het moet lezen is de vraag, sommigen uit mijn leesclub kwamen er maar moeilijk door, terwijl ik soms meer dan 75 pagina’s op een dag las, niet altijd even boeiend maar op het geheel de 5* meer dan waard."

296,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19601268-laura,Rating 5 out of 5,"Middlemarch è l'ennesimo motivo per cui adoro i classici inglesi. ""Studio di vita provinciale"" è il sottotitolo affidato a quest'opera e, come nel caso de I Buddenbrook, rappresenta alla perfezione ciò che andremo a trovare. Middlemarch è un romanzo dalla mole non indifferente e devo ammettere che le prime cento pagine sono state abbastanza ostiche e non pensavo che sarei arrivata poi alla fine così entusiasta e con un voto pieno. In realtà l'ho terminato a notte fonda, quando mi mancavano un centinaio di pagine e pensavo che fosse ormai ora di andare a dormire, ma non ho saputo resistere e così ho compiuto una full immersion finale. Middlemarch è un romanzo corale, ambientato appunto nella cittadina omonima della provincia inglese, dove prendono vita diversi personaggi appartenenti a diverse famiglie. Un occhio attento è dato ai matrimoni che si compiono in queste pagine, in particolare a due matrimoni infelici che saranno il fulcro poi del romanzo e da cui si dipaneranno altre storie. Uno di questi personaggi è Dorothea Brooke - forse il personaggio di cui mi sono ricreduta maggiormente fra tutti quelli letti nella mia vita - che viene presentata al pubblico quasi come una santa, una sorta di Santa Teresa, a cui non importa dei suoi averi, di abiti e di gioielli, ma che vive per uno scopo superiore, fare del bene con le sue azioni. E che modo migliore c'era all'epoca per fare del bene per una donna dotata di un patrimonio non esagerato? Naturalmente prendendosi cura di un marito, un marito che come lei pensa, dovrà insegnarle a farsi le sue opionini, facendole capire quali valga la pena avere. Questo è il primo punto di scontro con Dorothea, perché fin da subito appare chiaro che le sue opinioni sono ormai ben formate, ma il tutto stona con il fatto che voglia assoggettarsi a un uomo. Il suo errore lo fa sposando l'uomo sbagliato che oltre a sbagliato è anche perfido fino alla fine e egoista, perché non ha mai mostrato un briciolo di affetto per quella donna che non si è mai preso la briga di comprendere. Un uomo vecchio stampo, che pensa che le mogli siano per natura inferiori ai mariti di cui dovrebbero esaudire ogni desiderio. Fin da subito questi due personaggi insieme appaiono stonati, anche se in realtà il marito di Dorothea appare stonato anche da solo. Dorothea Brooke è un altro personaggio femminile indimenticabile, con cui è molto facile scontrarsi per il suo essere martire così spesso, ma di cui adoro la volontà di ferro. Una volta che la decisione è presa è presa per sempre. Dorothea si erge al di sopra di una società governata dagli uomini, occupandosi di affari e lasciando da parte i desideri del marito. Questo, lo zio e il cognato cercheranno tutti di indicarle la strada. Dorothea è una vera eroina di fine Ottocento che alla fine segue il suo cuore mandando al diavolo tutto e tutti e fregandose delle convenzioni sociali.L'altro personaggio a compiere un matrimonio infelice è il Dottor Lydgate, nuovo arrivato nella cittadina. I problemi economici, un matrimonio avventato e la superficialità della moglie intaccheranno la sua persona. Per se stesso aveva scelto la strada della medicina, da cui era stato affascinato in giovane età, ma una serie di circostanze sfortunate dettate dalla moglie e dal caso, lo abbattono. Questi sono i due personaggi ""principali"" ma come dimenticare tutti gli altri che ruotano attorno a loro? A partire da Mary Garth, così decisa a non accettare l'amore di Fred Vincy fin quando questo non avesse messo la testa a posto, per poi passare a Celia Brooke, la sorella di Dorothea, William Ladislaw, personaggio che ho trovato interessante con le sue tante sfumature, con una buona dose di pregi e anche qualche difetto, fino ad arrivare al più miserabile dei vagabondi, che avrà poi il suo ruolo nell'intreccio. Non si parla di personaggi secondari, in fondo vanno ad occupare anche capitoli interi e le loro azioni si ripercuoteranno su questa piccola società. In questo microcosmo si dà importanza al matrimonio ma George Eliot rende abbastanza chiaro il suo pensiero, non per nulla parte da due matrimoni falliti ancora prima di iniziare, perché per quanto si possa volere bene al partner, è difficile vivere da pari se non lo si rispetta. L'intento non è nemmeno quello di creare del romanticismo tra Lydgate e Dorothea che, pur essendo rispettivamente eroe e eroina, avranno dei destini differenti, e ciò si discosta dalla maggior parte dei romanzi dell'epoca. George Eliot con uno stile praticamente perfetto mette a nudo ogni suo personaggio e intreccia le loro vite, analizzando la società di fine Ottocento di cui mostra ogni pregio e difetto."

And yes, 4 stars, which for a book of the stature of Middlemarch, translates as, “This is very good, but I was disappointed.” Middlemarch is the story of a number of people in an English town in the early 1830s, written decades later with the benefit of research. There’s the idealistic Dorothea, who wants to do good in the world; the equally idealistic Lydgate, who wants to reform the medical profession; the careless but good-natured Fred; the evangelical banker, Bulstrode, who has a dark secret; and many more. Several storylines intersect throughout the novel, which touches on politics, religion, medicine, social change and a good deal more. Eliot has a reputation for writing great characters, and yes, the characters here are all distinct, complex and believable. And yes, the writing is genuinely insightful, and when the narrator (as she often does) comments on some aspect of human nature, it’s likely to be something you’ll recognize, perhaps something you hadn't quite put your finger on before. And yet, it is a long and slow-paced novel, taking a lot of time for scene-setting and extended metaphors, and also a rather didactic one; I felt the characters were explained more than shown, smothered under layers of authorial intent. I never felt much connection to this story, though it did become more interesting as it went. While I recognize Eliot’s talent here, it’s not a book that captured me and I find myself with little to say about it. However, my lukewarm response may not predict yours. First, I enjoy strong writing and complex characters, but am less interested in more academic aspects of literary writing, such as classical references, symbolism, or extended metaphor; those who eat all that up are likely to love this. And second, I’m just tired of reading about well-to-do, repressed English country people in the 19th century; I think I’ve reached the point at which, however insightful an author’s vision may be, it loses its luster by focusing on this particular milieu. Within that setting, Eliot’s scope is much broader than, say, Austen’s, but for all the books that have been written about it, this society is simply not that interesting. On to something else, and maybe in 20 or 30 years I’ll reread this and like it more.  On the edition: I read the Penguin Classics version, which is fine. Endnotes are somewhat more numerous than necessary, but at least they don’t spoil anything."

It had addled my brain) I set myself the task of reading George Eliot’s colossal masterpiece Middlemarch. Running to over 900 pages it’s quite the undertaking and at the beginning I’ll admit I was rather daunted. However once I got into it I was hooked.I could talk about how Eliot lifts the lid on a small provincial town, but that’s what everyone talks about in relation to this book. For me Middlemarch is like a Victorian soap, with its host of characters and numerous storylines. Many of the story lines intersect or cross over, yet they remain distinct. Such a number of storylines all of apparent equal status is unusual in a novel though would not be out of place in a soap. The is little dramatic action, yet the stories twist and turn. There are star crossed lovers, unhappy marriages, contested wills and seedy pasts. In other words all the full range of story lines from any soap or drama.In terms of characters there is the typical host of Victorian characters. The focus is very much on the middle and upper classes, therefore there are the aspiring merchants, the landed gentry and the clergymen. There is no clear heroine due to the number of story lines, though in so much as there is, it would be Dorothea. She is the typical virtuous angelic Victorian heroine. I have little time for such angles. Rosamond is a spoilt brat who ended up annoying me. The most interesting of the female characters is Mary Garth. She is funny and clever, and not afraid to speak her mind. She is probably the most spirited of the female characters. The male characters were less irritating and overall I liked them equally well. Dr Lydgate was a bit serve and I feel there was a missed opportunity of a witty sarcastic character in him. Both Fred Vincy and Will Ladislaw were charming and likable in different ways, with Ladislaw falling the most easily into the role of a Victorian hero though not in the irritating way of Dorothea.Overall a really enjoyable book and if you get mentally make it past it daunting size it is actually an easy enough read. For anyone who enjoys reading classics I would strongly recommend it."

It’s a pace that imitates the serial way it was released, though Middlemarch was actually published in the eight “books” and now it’s divided into the individual chapters of each “book.” I can highly recommend the leisurely approach. Reading just a little every day kept me interested, engaged, and appreciative of the especially rich text, full of insightful commentary, trenchant thoughts, and germane asides, while still allowing me to keep track of the large cast of characters and their interconnecting stories. Each chapter was a highlight of my day so I feel (temporarily, I hope) at a loss now that I’ve finished the book.Of the novel's many threads the most prominent involve idealistic Dorothea Brooke, who against the advice of everyone marries a dried up religious pedant of a man thinking he will lead her to a life of meaning, and Tertius Lydgate, a doctor with great plans for doing good who traps himself in a marriage that foils all his dreams. Before starting Middlemarch I mistakenly thought it was a depressing novel of thwarted love and ambition, but that’s far from the case though it does address serious issues that include marriage, religion, political reform, the expectations of society, and the status of women. The book ends with a realistic mix of poignancy, happiness, and hope, not unmitigated tragedy. What I maybe treasure most about the novel is how sympathetically it is written. There are villains of a sort, vapid selfish Rosamund, mean spirited Mr. Casaubon and hypocritical Mr Bulstrode, and there are certainly characters that make very bad decisions, like Lydgate and Dorothea, but George Eliot writes with such level-headed sensibility and understanding that their troubles touched me and I couldn’t condemn or belittle any of them."
300,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/107042319-john-banks,Rating 5 out of 5,"A re-read of this classic in January 2024.Middlemarch undoubtedly secures its place among my top ten favorite novels. Virginia Woolf famously commented that Middlemarch is 'one of the few English novels written for adult people', and I wholeheartedly agree. It stands as one of the greatest—if not the greatest—works of 19th-century literature.Set in the 1830s Victorian England, within the fictional Village of Middlemarch, this work captures the societal impacts of industrialization. Through intricately observed relationships among the central characters, Eliot investigates themes of marriage, gender, women's roles in society, class dynamics, and much more. At the heart of Middlemarch's lies the character of Dorothea Brooke and her tumultuous marriage to Mr. Casaubon, alongside her relationships with family, friends, and fellow villagers. Eliot's exploration of Dorothea's inner life—her motivations, desires, and self-delusions—and their interplay with the social context of the period is nothing short of brilliant.Eliot's portrayal of societal dynamics through her diverse cast of characters is indeed genius. The character of Rosamund Vincy and her entanglement with and marriage to the young Dr. Lydgate adds yet another layer to this monumental social realist novel. Middlemarch rightfully appears on numerous lists of the greatest novels, standing shoulder to shoulder with works like Madame Bovary.While I hold a deep affection for Dickens and find much readerly joy in his novels—Bleak House, Great Expectations, David Copperfield, Our Mutual Friend—all of which are undeniably brilliant, Middlemarch holds a special place for me as a pinnacle of literary brilliance. It ranks alongside the works of Austen and the Brontë sisters—Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights—in the canon of classic literature. These are the oft-cited classics for good reason, and revisiting them, including this recent return to the many pages of Middlemarch, is always a treat, revealing something new with each reading."

I was hesitant to read it mainly due to the sheer size of it and secondly because reading the first chapter led me to take the best nap I had ever taken since starting high school.Middlemarch is one of those books that appears extremely boring at first but slowly entwines around your heart and mind till you literally can’t get enough of it. I couldn’t care less about the characters in the beginning but slowly, by the end, as the characters crossed paths with each other and their destinies became interconnected, I didn’t want to stop reading about their lives. I still want a weekly newsletter keeping me abreast of the happenings in Middlemarch.Rosemary Ashton said that George Eliot excels at dialogue writing and I back her up a billion percent. The dialogues between two friends, mother- daughter, mother-son, husband-wife, lovers, etc. which occurred in between all that dense content was such a breath of fresh air. I couldn’t get enough of it.It can be a bit of a struggle but the main 3-4 storylines make up a very engrossing plot. It can basically be boiled down to 3 intertwined romance stories  4 if you include Celia and Sir James Chettam mixed up with village politics, reform bills, gossiping housewives and well-meaning rectors.On a side note, things I learned about George Eliot after reading this book:1) She is obsessed with lenses2) If she wasn’t a writer, she would probably be a doctor (if it was allowed back then)3) Man, does she know how to write dialogues dripping with sarcasm. I am starting to think every Victorian woman (writer or otherwise) was equipped with this specific skill."

While there, huddled up in the shadows, clinging fast to the bridge and refusing to jump, cowered the frightened, silly, weak little girl who'd first proposed this bold leap?Well, V. Woolf now joins the long list of people who've all pointed out in various ways that I'm not much of a grownup.This is not at all a bad book, and while reading it I was almost continuously struck by some brilliant descriptive passage or insight into human nature or razored turn of phrase. But while I'm not reading it, I never want to be. If the book's open, we're good, but I don't open it for the simple reason that it doesn't call to me, and because there's just always something else that I'd rather open instead.I'm sure Middlemarch is great, and I could totally read it. And if there weren't other books I wanted to read more, then I totally would. Probably someday I'll try this again. For the moment I might be too much of a city mouse or something; we just don't have that chemistry, I don't find this book fun.

This seemed sort of silly to me, but now I understand it. George Eliot is the master of creating fully realized, inner lives for all of her characters, even the most blamable ones. In fact, she's so good at it that it becomes the focus of the book itself. Middlemarch isn't so much a traditional novel as it is a study of a community and all its spidery, weaving interpersonal connections.The length of the book is somewhat to its detriment. I know that if I hadn't been reading this for my exams I probably would have put it down after the first 150 pages or so and never thought twice about it, but because I pushed through, I ended up getting to know these characters better than I know most people. I kind of fell in love with them, and with the quiet, assured way that Eliot writes about them. I've got to be honest with you about that one: did not see it coming. Like Vanity Fair, another famously long 19th century novel, Middlemarch was serialized, and it's original audience would have read it in increments over a period of years, and like the stretched out serialization of a great TV show, this would have made it both less overwhelming, and easier for readers to feel like these characters were part of their everyday lives as well, and not just characters in a book that you read once for a couple of weeks. So, all in all, it was worth it."

Román je situovaný do prvej polovice 19.storočia do mestečka Middlemarch a autorka v ňom píše o osudoch obyvateľov, ktoré sú zdanlivo nesúvisiace, no v podstate sú všetky navzájom poprepletané. Bola som očarená autorkinou múdrosťou a štýlom, ba priam prekvapená ako je možné, že táto kniha doteraz unikla mojej pozornosti, keďže knihy z viktoriánskeho obdobia sa mi páčia. Spočiatku som sa zamýšľala nad tým, čo len môže autor písať v takom rozsiahlom románe a hlavne tak, aby zaujal čitateľa od prvej strany po poslednú. Postupne ako som čítala kapitolu za kapitolou som obdivovala Eliotovej schopnosť tohto umenia udržať pozornosť a ešte aj v poslednej tretine knihy ma stále prekvapovala zvratmi, ktoré zakomponovala do svojho románu a ani chvíľu som nemala chuť knihu odložiť. Vytvorila úžasné postavy a postavičky, mnohé z nich si určite zamilujete a budete im fandiť, aby sa ich príbeh vyvíjal v pozitívnom smere.  Pokiaľ mi pamäť siaha, takúto „bichlu“ som ešte nečítala, no v budúcnosti sa k nej určite vrátim. Napriek tomu, že sa naše životy sa diametrálne líšia od životov ľudí v 19.storočí (hlavne vymoženosťami), pokiaľ ide o charaktery, kladné či záporné vlasnosti a ľudské problémy samotné, nič sa nemení ani po stáročiach :-) "
305,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19540749-richard-newton,Rating 5 out of 5,"The speed with which I read this book does not reflect my level of enjoyment. I read it slowly, mostly because I had so much else to read in parallel - business books (dull, but necessary), and philosophy (some dull, some good). Don't judge my pace as a measure of this book's quality, for this is a rather wonder reading experience.As a whole I have avoided 19th century British literature - I hold no specific bias against it, but with so many good books in the world, one has to focus somewhere. But this was regarded highly by so many people that I felt I had to give it a go. I was not disappointed. The story has a few twists and turns, but in reality it is not for the story itself that I enjoyed the book. That story might be summarised as: be careful who you fall in love with, and even more so with whom you marry. It is in many ways a period piece, reflecting the views of the period - although with a penetrating eye. The main pleasure is the language. I think you could write a book of quotes from the one book alone. She has such a beautiful turn of phrase - phrasing that for all its 19th century language is still a joy to read. Many of those sentences made me smile."
306,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/928049-dawn,Rating 4 out of 5,"Henry James said ""Middlemarch is a treasure-house of details, but it is an indifferent whole."" And while I had a blast reading this and want to duke it out with him, I can't exactly remark on the whole of it without, well, indifference. There's no great coming-together or falling-apart here. It's a testament to the incremental. Characters with big plans end up either total failures or adjusting their ambitions to the tenor of their littler surroundings. Reminds me of another M-town I would like to forget. The notion of reform and change in any political, moral and marital sense leads to misery and disappointment. Which is right, but doesn't exactly make your soul stir. Eliot is a master of the little things that keep us down: the pettiness, jealousies, self-righteousness, obstinateness, etc, which make the book thoroughly enjoyable but not a little unsatisfying because everybody's buggered."

Going in, I was expecting loads of description and introspection (and was not disappointed on that account), but what really took me by surprise was Eliot’s sense of humor which permeates her writing more often than not, providing much-needed levity to the mix. This, along with the two main plots (especially Dorothea’s), managed to make me turn the page even when the thought of DNF-ing laid heavy on my mind. Again, this is neither a light read nor a particularly thrilling one (long-winded and meandering would be more like it), but all in all one can hardly deny Eliot’s talent as a writer whose main purpose here is to give us a big fat slice of literary realism, something she does with flying colors."

My friend reread this last year and after hearing that I needed to read this soon. I was hooked early on because the characters were extremely interesting and faults were in all of them which made them so real to life. Middlemarch is a town that includes middle class and not far away the higher class land owners. Scandal, married life, women's roles, gossiping, rationalizing and morality are just so part of this story which centers on 3 main couples and their trials of life which luck plays a big part in some even when plans are made which are not to their liking. ❤️ it!"

I had no sympathy for any of the major characters, actively disliked some of them (Rosamond was a spoiled brat), and to be honest didn't really care what happened to them. A few of the minor characters were okay (like the Garths, Mr Farebrother, Mrs Bulstrode), but not worth struggling through 850 pages for, and she still managed to rush the ending, so it was unsatisfying.If I want to read something like this again, I'll pick Dickens, who at least usually has a story."

319,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/130397631-jonat,Rating 5 out of 5,"Scenes which make vital changes in our neighbors’ lot are but the background of our own, yet, like a particular aspect of the fields and trees, they become associated for us with the epochs of our own history, and make a part of that unity which lies in the selection of our keenest consciousness  Certain traits that our present moment thinking deems innocuous and irrelevant are very often, retrospectively, the crucial factors in what has shaped our actions at a particular moment in life.  The subjective irrelevancy we find in certain details tend to be the origin of any encounter in human lives, even the most historically acclaimed ones … The irony of the life of each individual is thus to be mended, to converge, on the lives of others, because of details of their lives which the individual used to overlook. She has masterfully broken down that central theme into several areas throughout the story, in order to reveal to us its due importance. We will go from history to the origin behind the frequency of our disappointments through Dorothea’s rushed marriage, thwarting destiny by developing a more guaranteed form of our future; lighting a torch of past memories’ shadow right next to us, criticizing superfluous and confusing art by once again, revealing the relevance of her central theme in the equation; in each of these fields. So, I have decided to structure my review by chronicling each of them: I-/ Art: The industry is filled of art that perturbs and dulls notions we already know of life, instead of raising them and making us discover truths, like the one she is doing. The more than often incomprehensiveness of the former type of art is pointless to her compared to art that makes us perceive truths that go unnoticed to us in our everyday life… and i have to agree with her^^ II-/ The frequency of our disappointments in hasty decisions (Dorothea’s marriage): I saw myself stopping my reading in the middle of each sentence as the omniscient narrator spoke for how much the eloquence of her language galvanized my attention; as I strained my eyesight further, the images created by the author were so heavy to absorb each time... not in their length, but in the thickness of the contextual power enclosed in these few words between 2 commas: the generating emotional process passes by a centrifugation in order to clearly separate the ‘dim’ aspect of Dorothea’s knowledge on a field, contrasted with the ´eager’ aspect of her mind towards an alien world.. her future marriage. The result created resplendent shapes that stuck in her memory, despite the lack of knowledge. And whose deceptive nature and longevity will remain there…. even when we will not think of them… unknowingly going on in our lives, and then guided by this untrustworthy and abstract pilot , which stole the place of where actual memory lived by the individual should be.A girl whose ardent nature turned all her small allowance of knowledge into principles, fusing her actions into their mould, and whose quick emotions gave the most abstract things the quality of a pleasure or a pain… A girl who had lately become a wife, and from the enthusiastic acceptance of untried duty found herself plunged in tumultuous preoccupation with her personal lot-  III-/ Thwarting destiny by developing a more guaranteed form of our future: The theme of the novel is to be aware of the subtle influence of external factors on our initial future... here, she invites us not to get too easily swayed by it. The author wants us to develop a state of independence and stop letting fate’s whims guide our happiness or unhappiness. Because if we do allow that to happen, we also simultaneously wrapped up the people we heaped our personal future on - on the palm of destiny’s whims. We rob them away from the independent character of their future in the process, while jeopardizing the nature of our own future, bc its success is now reliant on those other people (these external factors that I invited in my life). Fred borrowed money to Caleb Garth - poor father-, and now, Fred’s inner fulfillment depends on whether or not he will pay back Caleb on time.  Letting the idea of borrowing rush into position ahead of plans he had spent much more time conceptualizing… She invites her audience to provisionally frame our object and correcting it to more and more exactness of relation; piercing the obscurity of those minute processes which prepare human misery and joy, those invisible thoroughfares that are the lurking-places of anguish, mania, and crime, that delicate poise and transition which determine the growth of happy or unhappy consciousness. IV-/ Past memories:Even in Bulstrode's case in which the character's portrayal initially failed to seduce me, the omniscient narrator had so much eloquence when retracing the various threads of Bulstrode's past life,interweaving across the air, connecting themselves chaotically, joining and reaching all that one circle making them part of the same unity, our current self.Pushing the importance of his character by her quality as an orator… gripping and striking; when you really make the effort to read her words, you can only feel those inner shudders that are just human reactions after being subjected to truths that we all know but expressed with a sort of aura much more striking than the normal.The words or deeds we used to recklessly throw out of our mouths - for example a hypocritical ex-priest like Bulstrode - who months or years later find themselves bearing the consequences of those deeds; maybe his future wife will learn that it was a person who was hiding outrageous crimes from his past.. and so; the present Bulstrode will receive bitter flavors and merited shame because of it… In this sense, and regarding the still central theme.The past that seemed like just a dead story of our life most of the time was actually an outworn preparation of the present.--On another angle, regarding vague conviction of someone’s guilt. Mr. Lydgate’s…One of those cases on which a man is condemned on the ground of his character.. (that trivial past history) - it is believed that he has committed a crime in some undefined way, because he had the motive for doing itAssuming that Lydgate -in need of money- had been bribed by bulstrode so as to remain silent regarding the latter’s scandalous acts.Everybody liked better to conjecture how the thing was, than simply to know it: for conjecture soon became more confident than knowledge, and had a more liberal allowance for the incompatible.  V-/ HISTORY!!The reductive aspects upon which history retains people’s lives~Dorothea was spoken of to a younger generation as a fine girl who married a sickly clergyman, old enough to be her father, and in little more than a year after his death gave up her estate to marry his cousin --- young enough to have been his son, with no property and not well-born.Judging her character, ignorant that they are the mixed result of young and noble impulse struggling amidst the conditions of an imperfect social state, in which great feelings will often take the aspect of error, and great faith the aspect of illusion. The irony of the life of each individual is to be mended, to converge, on the lives of others, because of details of their lives which the individual used to overlook. For George Eliot, it is absurd to study the high points of human history without speaking strongly about those crucial causes which gave rise to them and continue to give rise to them.. but ironically, seem so insignificant to mankind, and even the contemporary man who is so interested in history. In order to render the portrait of her narrative intent artistically coherent, she had every interest in keeping the paradoxical character of this phenomenon through the wit of her prose; but also, not to extravagantly highlight that central theme, because all its relevance, as we have just underlined, rests in its minimalist and ordinary nature in everyday life… on its ability to pass unnoticed to other people.  The same feature is thus, also attached to the subtle, inoffensive – almost flavorless **tone** of her prose. It is not commanding, it is not flowery either, it has a balance between mundanity and exquisite language: a subtle spring wind crossing your body with a light caressing impression.  She’s interested in the mundane that escapes our notice, the movements and acts that we and historians deem unimportant, but which ironically develops unnoticed in our brain, and influences our lives and those of the world history in a meaningful way. This theme that even historians neglect, is expressed in many ways during her story, in different contexts, the ones highlighted above. And she has also structured all of her work in such a way that this single concept is the predominant web that covers the entire book.The story started with separated families, in very different contexts, who were hence indifferent to the concern of another at first; but it is precisely those zones of ignorance, that electromagnetic field, which gradually attracted them, into a unicity of concerns.  George’s Eliot initial scattered establishment of her cast, as well as the seemingly unrelated key points that tied down each character to the one another, as well as their narrative progression into a unity because of those ordinary “key points”, serve to implicitly create within each reader the experience of human indifference/unawareness during a process of convergence of one individual’s life to that of Others’. Labeling a book “historical” when it emits almost no world-famous historical references seems foolish and pretentious at first glance: but specifically because of the emptiness of such famous references, that all the historical relevance of this book lies.Mother Theresa surely had also met during her life non-historically known people like Mr Lydgate, Ladyslaw, Bulstrode, etc.., whose lives - if erased from Theresa’s brain system - would have prevented Theresa’s opportunity of reforming a conventual life, since the medium in which her ardent deeds took shape would be forever gone.And the reasons behind this impediment are so subtle, that there is a good chance that even Theresa herself would not be aware that without having lived the interactions with Mr Lydgate or Bulstrode, all the great exploits of her life would have never occurred.For George Eliot, it was essential to retrace a life of someone like Mother Theresa, that is Dorothea’s, to expose the readers how Dorothea’s inward being, no matter how strong, (we remember how Dorothea was stubborn and hard-willed), is greatly determined by what lies outside it. Those external factors…“𝘕𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘭𝘥 𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘦 𝘴𝘶𝘣𝘵𝘭𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘤𝘦𝘴𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘪𝘳 𝘨𝘳𝘢𝘥𝘶𝘢𝘭 𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘨𝘦!

Because its core concerns the ordinary details found in a book.-The conventional structure of a novel, requiring the reader to diligently follow each plot line so as to get a better grasp of the ending of the novel…. finds its relevance being heightened to the central theme of Middlemarch, which urges its readers to diligently retrace every subtle influence, these plot points, and to follow their growth throughout the individual, these plot lines, so as to properly understand the truth behind the expression of the behavior of the individual at a given moment, the ending of the novel.  -And in the same way that, a reader who would not have done this job of following the plot lines’ courses throughout will not understand the origin behind the ending of the novel; so in the same way, anyone who would not have done this job of paying attention to the subtle influences that might seeped within their mind and develop itself within it, will not understand the origin of their behavior at a given moment in the future.  -The description of each emotion which is so often just used to make the reader attracted into the narrative,  -the interactions between characters which are - obviously - explained by a web of logical psychological motives; (admittedly very few reach this level of depth...) Still, the author gives such immense thematic 𝐝𝐢𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐨 𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐚 𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤.

320,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48011083-steve,No Rating,"Written in high English, with those few exceptions when field workers grumbled, or town folk gossiped, Middlemarch was a long journey. The stage for this drama is the title town in rural England. The plot unfolds around the time of the 1832 Reform Act and the arrival of railroads. Ms. Eliot writes of the relationships, deaths, aspirations, and behaviors, both noble and ignoble, of a range of characters, most related by blood or marriage.Dorothea Brooke is one principal, who as a late teenage ingénue – nevertheless endowed with great purposeful conviction – marries a man more than twice her age, Edward Casaubon. The marriage deadens immediately. Rather than living for decades in a hopeless, miserable union, as so many do, Dorothea is quickly resuscitated with her husband’s early death. She is not free to test the limits of her newly restored potential, though. Casaubon inserted a codicil to his will removing Dorothea’s substantial inheritance should she remarry his young cousin suspected of amorous intentions, Will Ladislaw. Other featured relationships are Dr. Tertius Lydgate, a physician who struggles financially, and Rosamond Vincy; Mary Garth and Fred Vincy, Rosamond’s brother; and, as minor characters, Dorothea’s sister, Celia Brooke, and Sir James Chettam, who failed in his initial quest for Dorothea’s hand while single.To dwell back on Casaubon for a moment, I keenly agreed with his intellectual devotion. He dedicated his energies toward future publication of a Key to all Mythologies, a volume that I certainly would add to my own personal library, to be placed adjacent to The Repeating Rifle in the Bulgarian Army, Sense of the Infinite on the Western Shore of Victoria Nyanza, and the General Statistical Study of the Canton of Yonville, followed by Various Climatological Observations. As he aged, he realized female companionship through matrimony might be a wise idea, even though a potential impediment to his research. Dorothea initially believed without reservation in her husband's pursuit until Will Ladislaw commented in Rome that Casaubon did not read German and was, therefore, unable to make a real contribution to academic thought. To Ladislaw, ""the Germans have taken the lead in historical inquiries, and they laugh at results which are got by groping about in woods with a pocket-compass while they have made good roads."" He also noted that Casaubon's work was unlikely to prove of lasting value, even accounting for the lack of attention to significant German scholarship, because ""The subject Mr. Casaubon has chosen is as changing as chemistry: new discoveries are constantly making new points of view. Who wants a system on the basis of the four elements, or a book to refute Paracelsus?"" Nevertheless, how disappointing for all that Dorothea failed to continue Casaubon's work, despite the detailed instructions he left her. Ms. Eliot writes of themes important to relationships generally and to English society of that era, such as gambling, indebtedness, cholera, innovations, religious conventions, dirty little family secrets, blackmail, inheritances, addictions, alcohol, and opium, among others. I sensed that Middlemarch was, in a way, a nineteenth century soap opera, a laborious nineteenth century soap opera. Can you imagine what the producers of As the World Turns – some knew it better as ATWT – would have done to this story?Middlemarch would be the ideal prop for a country gentleman tailored in cravat and smoking jacket at rest before a grand, blazing hearth, andirons perfectly proportioned, a warm brandy snifter at hand, a champion hound at foot. What better way to finish an afternoon on the moor after bagging three brace of grouse than to then fall asleep to these pages. And fall asleep I did, many times, without the elaborate scenery and costume. For Middlemarch is prolix. Have a glance at the following sentence – randomly selected with unscrupulous fidelity:The fact is unalterable, that a fellow-mortal with whose nature you are acquainted solely through the brief entrances and exits of a few imaginative weeks called courtship, may, when seen in the continuity of married companionship, be disclosed as something better or worse than what you have preconceived, but will certainly not appear altogether the same. Oh, if Ms. Eliot had only followed the words of Queen Gertrude who told my favorite bumbling raconteur, Polonius, “More matter, with less art.” Had she, I would have had the spare time to read two or three more books."
321,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1192324-ana,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was my first read by George Eliot and I really liked it. I’ve found the subtitle “A Study of Provincial Life” very accurate because although this is a novel, the historical detail it provides on the social and political aspects of life in a small provincial town are really impressive.Her characters come to life and we find ourselves immersed in their stories. In between, the narrator provides us with side comments, sometimes sarcastic, other times just really insightful. Marriage being one of the major themes of this book, I am not surprised that Freud wrote that this novel ‘illuminated important aspects’ of his relationship with his wife.A few quotes I highlighted while reading:When a man has seen the woman whom he would have chosen if he had intended to marry speedily, his remaining a bachelor will usually depend on her resolution rather than on his.The fact is unalterable, that a fellow-mortal with whose nature you are acquainted solely through the brief entrances and exits of a few imaginative weeks called courtship, may, when seen in the continuity of married companionship, be disclosed as something better or worse than what you have preconceived, but will certainly not appear altogether the same.A wife, a modest young lady, with the purely appreciative, unambitious abilities of her sex, is sure to think her husband’s mind powerful. Whether Providence had taken equal care of Miss Brooke in presenting her with Mr. Casaubon was an idea which could hardly occur to him. Society never made the preposterous demand that a man should think as much about his own qualifications for making a charming girl happy as he thinks of hers for making himself happy.“You must be sure of two things: you must love your work, and not be always looking over the edge of it, wanting your play to begin. And the other is, you must not be ashamed of your work, and think it would be more honourable to you to be doing something else. You must have a pride in your own work and in learning to do it well, and not be always saying, There’s this and there’s that—if I had this or that to do, I might make something of it. No matter what a man is—I wouldn’t give twopence for him (…) whether he was the prime minister or the rick-thatcher, if he didn’t do well what he undertook to do.”"
322,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6625371-elisabeth,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 stars. I enjoyed this thoughtful, masterfully constructed novel far more than I expected. Eliot's prose can be a touch ponderous in passages where she is discussing ideas, but her delineation of character and interactions between people are wonderful.One of the major themes of the novel is marriage, and more particularly the pitfalls of marrying someone for what one imagines them to be rather than who they actually are. Dorothea, Lydgate, and Rosamund all make this mistake in one way or another. Dorothea imagines Casaubon to be nobler, wiser, and more interesting than he really is, because her superficial first impressions match the ideal she has built up in her head about the kind of person she would like to marry—Rosamund, on the other hand, makes almost an inverted version of the same mistake: she marries Lydgate chiefly because she sees him as someone who can give her the ideal lifestyle she imagines for herself, and fails to comprehend that he has higher and more serious ambitions and principles that are above her conception.Mary Garth, on the other hand, provides a perfect foil for both these relationships. She has known Fred Vincy since childhood and is clear-eyed enough to see his faults and weaknesses as well as his good points—and has the strength of character to hold him to a certain standard before she will commit to marriage.(I must add here that the entire Garth family is an absolute treasure, and Mary's father Caleb Garth is pretty much the best character in the entire novel.)I think a key point to notice is how short and formal both Dorothea and Rosamund's courtships are. Perhaps the important takeaway here is that unless one is particularly unbiased and perceptive, it takes more than a few weeks of surface-level interaction to judge someone's character and whether they would be truly suited to you as a spouse. Eliot never really says as much; at some times she almost seems to lean toward a Charlotte Lucas-style fatalism that regards it as a gamble whether you end up with a spouse that really suits you or not, because that's just how courtship is. But there's another important contrast with Mary Garth and Fred Vincy: Mary knows Fred well because she's known him long. It may not be necessary to know someone from childhood to know them without illusions, but it does take more than the few formal meetings on which Dorothea bases her castles in the air about her husband's character.The deepest flaw in the novel lies in something that I notice cropping up again and again in the work of English Victorian novelists: a contempt for nonconformist/low-church Christians. Bronte, Trollope, Gaskell et al all display this attitude to some extent, but seldom go deeper than depicting nonconformist characters as silly or not very nice people, but in Middlemarch Eliot gives us a little clearer view of what it is about evangelical views that conventional Church of England members find so annoying. They dislike ""spiritual religion""—which, if I'm not mistaken, refers to individual relationship and communion with God—which, um, also happens to be a core component of biblical Christianity. And they dislike clergymen whose sermons have ""too much doctrine"" in them. The most telling passage, I think, is this remark of Dorothea's while discussing the appointment of a new clergyman to the Lowick living with Lydgate:
“It is hard to imagine what sort of notions our farmers and laborers get from their teaching. I have been looking into a volume of sermons by Mr. Tyke: such sermons would be of no use at Lowick—I mean, about imputed righteousness and the prophecies in the Apocalypse.""
Well, maybe apocalyptic prophecy is of secondary doctrinal concern (though one could argue that bad eschatology has often damaged and hampered the church's influence on society—but that's another debate for another day!), but imputed righteousness is very much a core Christian doctrine. Essentially, what she is saying here is that the common people just need simple moral lessons because they aren't capable of understanding doctrine—a total discounting of the Bible's teaching that God's grace can make the doctrine of salvation intelligible to any mind, no matter what its level of education or intelligence! This conversation makes me consider what point Eliot tries to make with Dorothea's character arc. Dorothea longs for spiritual fulfillment; we see her learn through hard experience that arbitrary self-sacrifice and seeking after intellectual knowledge are not the way to find it, and eventually find more of a balance in her life. I can't help wondering if Eliot is subtly suggesting that one is better off by not bothering about ""spiritual religion"" (toward which Dorothea was inclined in earlier chapters) and just following the nominal Churchman's code of ""go to church, say your prayers, do good deeds.""The treatment of religion through Bulstrode’s character is also a complex and frustrating one. The biggest problem is that Eliot’s description of his beliefs seems to be based on a fundamentally flawed understanding of evangelical/Calvinist doctrine—for instance, in the chapter where he first encounters Raffles: the idea that almost anything he may do is excusable because his sins are already forgiven; or even more wildly, that because everything is predestined, anything wrong he might do must advance God’s purposes, so it must be okay to do it! This is basically hyper-grace and hyper-Calvinism; false doctrine being depicted as a typical evangelical belief.The nominal Churchmen detest Bulstrode for his self-proclaimed aim of “doing everything to the glory of God” (which, I may add, is another very core biblical principle) because Bulstrode uses and twists that phrase as an excuse for actions that could justly lay him open to criticism. It’s interesting, though I can’t decide whether it’s a point in Eliot’s favor or not, that she presents Bulstrode not as a hypocrite but as conflicted and majorly self-deluded, always talking himself into believing that his own motives are just. It’s rather refreshing to see an author not go the well-worn religious-hypocrite route; but does that mean his “evangelical” religion is being presented as the cause of his actions rather than a mere mask for them? To be fair, Eliot does briefly disclaim this idea twice in the text, but it comes across as rather half-hearted when weighed against the mass of dialogue and actions within the story that seem to be heavily implying the reverse.In spite of these criticisms, I still found Middlemarch a very rich, worthwhile, enjoyable classic—certainly one with a great deal of food for discussion! Definitely one of the best books I've read so far this year."

I think it's masterfully written and I absolutely loved so much of it, but there were elements I didn't enjoy. I'm putting it at 4 stars, but I could see it bumping up to a 5 star in my mind over time or upon a reread.Eliot's writing is stunning. I love her way with words and absolute adored so much of this book. I felt so emotionally connected to several of the characters, but Dorothea in particular. I felt like she was so well fleshed out and we saw her grow over time into who she became (which was true for several other characters as well). I felt a little lost for much of book 2, just because we were introduced to so many characters who were related in so many different ways and it was hard to keep track of it. Eventually I got my bearings and then enjoyed all of the drama that took place in this little town. There are characters that I never grew to love (*cough* Ladislaw and Rosamund *cough*), but I still enjoyed the story overall.Side note: I alternated physical reading with audiobook listening (and also occasionally immersion read) and just want to add that the narration by Juliet Stevenson is IMPECCABLE and I highly recommend it."

I always forget how rewarding it is to read a period drama, with it's small village dramas and over exaggerated character dialogue, don't get me wrong, I was amused during every second of it, all 900 plus pages. I am so grateful that I don't have spend twenty five minutes explaining to someone my point of view ten times during the course of a day, thankfully this can be done in one sentence now, maybe they just had so much time on the hands in the 1800's that every single conversation had to be drawn out and over dramatised... Alas, I did enjoy it immensely!"

326,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/896929-rachel,Rating 4 out of 5,"Middlemarch is not a novel. Middlemarch is a time traveling television series written on paper. Middlemarch is Game of Thrones intrigue on Downton Abbey sets with an Arrested Development narrator. These characters will make you crazy, make you cringe, make you cry. George Eliot is as sly at sass as she is great at scene-writing. I would never, ever have finished this without the help of Greedy Reads Long Reads book club, specifically their indulging my constant George Eliot fangirling and comparisons to modern TV. "
