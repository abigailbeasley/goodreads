0,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/763514-tung,Rating 5 out of 5,"In my classification system, there are books that are readers’ books (they tell an engaging story); there are books that are writers’ books (they are creative in their prose and technically sound); and then there are GREAT books that tell a good story through solid prose. Let the Great World Spin (the 2009 National Book Award winner) is such a book. The book shares the lives of seemingly random New Yorkers in 1974, and how their lives intertwine. At the surface, they seem connected by what happens in their lives in and around August 7, 1974 when a man walked a tightrope strung between the two towers of the World Trade Center. However, as the book progresses, we find out how their lives connect on much deeper levels. This book rewards patient readers. Impatient readers will find the first few chapters disjointed, with too many unconnected plot threads. Patient readers will get to see how all these threads come together; and come together they do, and beautifully so, in a way that reminded me of Cunningham’s The Hours. It’s one of the reasons that, if I had to choose one word to describe this book, it would be “well-crafted”. Patience also pays off for the reader in how the novel ends. For me, the first half of the book felt very dark: characters die, depressing lives remain depressing, and sorrows remain unredeemed. But in the last half of this book, there is this growing sense of hope and strength. And McCann’s story about the connectedness of life and the audacity of living despite the hardness of life completes itself. From a prose perspective, McCann has a writing style that was fluid enough to change its voice as it drifted from character to character, but was still able to retain its structure and feel. Sentences are sharp and concise and scene descriptions always had this energy behind it. Beautifully written, and perfectly crafted. Highly recommended."
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/891838-eric,Rating 5 out of 5,"This really may be the first truly profound novel to connect itself with September 11, 2001 and New York City, if only because it does so in such an understated, oblique, and poetically suggestive way. It's also a novel that may take over a hundred pages to truly capture your imagination, but once it does, and once the connective tissue of the disparate group of characters starts to reveal itself, the novel attains a kind of hypnotic and edgy grace for its duration. So richly and deeply are McCann's various characters drawn that one finally must marvel at how much he accomplishes in his 350 pages (i.e., it would take lesser writers at least another 100 pages to render these many lives as convincingly as he does). It's a novel about unlikely (and often unknown) linkages between people, and because some of these characters represent types who are most invisible and disenfranchised in our society it's a novel that enlarges our sympathies and our compassion (or at least it should). It's also a novel about those ""two towering beacons high in the clouds,"" the World Trade Center towers in their infancy, in a more innocent time, when they could be confronted by bravery, elan, and artistry rather than by terrorism. When the pedestrians look up to the buildings' peaks to see a tightrope walker making his way between them, their eyes cannot believe what they see -- and we reflect on the buildings' more recent history, when our eyes also could not believe what they saw, and when the notion of falling from the sky took on all those horrible shadings. When, on the novel's last page, one of McCann's characters reflects that, as humans, ""we stumble on ... [we] bring a little noise into the silence, find in others the ongoing of ourselves"" and concludes that ""it is almost enough,"" we feel all of the power this novel has been so patiently and inexorably building up."

No es mal libro, aunque me ha parecido un tanto irregular. Hay capítulos que me han gustado mucho, otros que prometían bastante más e incluso alguno que me sobra. Y no es que las vidas de estas personas no sean interesantes, es simplemente que su relato, con demasiada frecuencia, me ha dejado indiferente. Y eso es algo que quizás debería preocuparme porque todas las críticas ponían unánimemente el acento en su carga emotiva. Por destacar dos historias, me gustaron mucho la de Tillie (mi preferida) y la de unos ""artistas"" vanguardistas envueltos en un accidente de tráfico. Esta última creo que es emblemática de uno de los grandes temas que saqué del libro: el contraste entre la banalidad de algunas acciones y la tremenda y dura realidad de otras. En ella, una pareja que se tienen por grandes artistas y que tienen la obligación de actuar como tales -mucha droga, mucha liberalidad, muchas excentricidades-, tienen un accidente mortal y se dan a la fuga. A ella, el choque con la realidad, perdonen el fácil juego de palabras, que le supone el accidente le afecta sobremanera. Él, en cambio, está más preocupado por el estado de unos cuadros que se quedaron a la intemperie durante el incidente y que la lluvia estropeó. Un problema para el que pronto idea una gran solución: la reinterpretación de los cuadros modificados por la lluvia. Serían los primeros en hacer algo así, serían supermegaoriginales… lo que me da pie para expresar mi rechazo a ese concepto de la originalidad en el arte, algo que me supera, sobre todo cuando ese concepto de la originalidad, de ser el primero en hacer ese algo, es su única virtud. En este sentido, siempre viene a mi mente la parodia que Trueba hace de este concepto en una escena de su oscarizada película “Belle Époque” en la que el personaje encarnado por Fernando Fernán Gómez enseña su obra cumbre y última a su invitado, un jovencísimo Jorge Sanz, un cuadro totalmente en blanco, que, como él mismo resalta, se basa en el respeto al lienzo (su mujer que es muy burra opina que lo que pasa es que es muy vago, pero, claro, es que es muy burra esta mujer). El pintor está quejoso de que ya se lo hubiera copiado un ruso, un tal Malevich, y, orgulloso, señala a su invitado la esquina inferior derecha del cuadro donde, al lado de su firma, se recoge la fecha en la que fue pintando: un año antes que el ruso.Pero nada, lo importante es que el vasto mundo siga girando, ¿no? Bueno, eso y tener salud."

4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1126146-maggie,Rating 2 out of 5,"For a book that's solely supposed to be about characters....I thought all of these characters were amazingly one-dimensional. The self-sacrificing wanna-be priest? The smarter-than-she-looks hooker? The rich lonely Park Ave housewife? Nothing unique or original in there. Reading it didn't suck really hard, because it's an easy enough read, and there are little splotches of nice writing and insight throughout....but all in all, I didn't get it.I also didn't get the whole ""NYC in the '70s"" thing from the book either. But that might be because I'm inured to the supposed grittiness of the city back then by now. It all sounds so cliched. What I did like about the book - it made me close my eyes and imagine the Twin Towers and wonder and marvel what it would've been like to watch a man dance in the air so high up, alongside thousands of other amazed New Yorkers. RIP WTC."
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4426615-jason,Rating 4 out of 5,"I used to really enjoy short story collections. I used to read scary ones in elementary school, depressing ones in high school, and I even read trippy ones in college (thinking I was cool). But sometime during my post-college years, my interest in them began to wane. I don’t know whether this can be ascribed to getting older, but I do know that I now get frustrated with short stories. The time I invest in the setting and the characters, acclimating to the storytelling style and pacing—well, there’s not enough return on my investment. I just don’t have time for it anymore.Thankfully, this book is not a collection of short stories. Rather, it is a single story told in a collection, and the collection holds together nicely. Let the Great World Spin is actually the story of a particular place and time: New York City, August 1974. It is about the lawlessness and drudgery of the city’s inhabitants, it is about the angst of war, but it is also about those shining moments of hope and human achievement that pierce the angst and shred the drudgery to pieces. It is about two characters in particular, one real and one fictional, who serve as a sort of lamppost for a city steeped in darkness and self-loathing. Interestingly, both characters are outsiders—new arrivals from foreign soil—as if pulled in by a city that needs just a little bit of light, please.There is plenty to like about this book, too: its coherency, its writing style, its characters. But once again, I expose myself as a sucker for imagery. McCann uses metaphor like nobody’s business and I fricken loved it. I ended up reading this for our new book club on Goodreads, which I started with a bunch of friends as an excuse to squeeze even more books onto my reading list. And I have to admit, this was an excellent first pick.

I'm supposed to let the reader know why he or she should, could, or would want to read a title.You should, could, AND would want to read this National Book Award-winning novel of grief, sadness, and loss because it's so damned easy to love and cherish these characters. The Catholic monk whose vocation is to bring a whisper of compassion, in its ancient and literal meaning of ""shared pain"", to the least and the last of people, the whores, drunks, druggies that we (most of us, anyway) do our damnedest to ignore; the wealthy mother of a Vietnam war casualty, one of the Army's computer guys, a geek whose interest in computers led him to help develop ARPANET, whose grandchild you and I are using right now; the tightrope-walking oddball whose main claim to an entry in the Akashic Records is walking between the World Trade Center's towers.I love them all, and more besides...Tillie, the whoring mother and grandmother, whose entire world-view centers on making it all just a little, weentsy bit better than it has to be, Gloria whose losses mount and mount and still mount but whose sense of life is that it's here, so's she, so what's a girl to do but laugh? And Jaslyn. Oh, so much hinges on Jaslyn, Claire's niece of the heart. So much comes to its final, painful, joyous fruition with her arrival...and truly, ladies and gentlemen, at last here the great world spins.Really, nothing I say can impact your personal decision to read the book or not. I can, and do, recommend it. Millions of the maniacs on a mission who have already read it are doing just that. I can only encourage you to support a writer who can create a character who says of her dead daughter's attempted savior:""They told me {he} smashed all the bones in his chest when he hit the steering wheel. Well at least in Heaven his...chick'll be able to reach in and grab his heart.""

And I’m NOT kidding! There’s a crazy guy doing gymnastics on a tightrope between the Twin Towers, a million feet up in the air. All the other people can look up (and are obsessed with looking up, in fact, which is totally beyond my comprehension since I have to stare intently at my feet), so what’s with me? I’m afraid of heights, so I just can’t look. I just can’t. But how can just reading about this bizarre and incredible feat affect me physically, make me dizzy and nauseous? The power of books. Just blows me away.This book is cool. It starts with a chapter about people looking up at the madman in the sky. The story is based on the real 1970s event of a guy who walked on a wire between the two insanely tall buildings. (Sort of eerie reading about these buildings that no longer exist.) Despite my vertigo, the story pulled me right in. But now I have to go directly to my complaint board. Because even though I was so damn happy to get away from the crazy man in the sky, I wasn’t so happy with where the author led me next—to a small town in Ireland. Who says I want to hang out with two brothers in Ireland? The contrast was too fast. You know I love New York, and even though I wanted to avoid the guy on the wire, I didn’t say I wanted to go overseas right then. The brothers bored me to tears and I felt no connection to them. They ended up in New York, and one of them was a priest who helped hookers. I usually like reading about squalor and down-and-outers, but for some reason their story left me cold. What a downer, after the excitement of the first chapter. But never fear, the next story had me mesmerized and mostly I liked all the other stories. Notice that I’m calling them stories. That’s complaint number 2. I signed up for a novel, but for a long while it read like a collections of short stories, too independent. I wanted dependence, I wanted connection, damn it. It took a while for the stories to meld. Finally, a little later than I liked, the stories were woven into a nice tapestry; in fact, a beautiful tapestry.All the sudden I was in love with the book. The language is to die for, lyrical and intense. The story so juicy meaty, the characters so interesting and complex. The interwoven plot is intense and heart-wrenching. And McCann is so damn profound, I was highlighting text like mad—sometimes whole paragraphs, in fact.A cool thing is that McCann is able to use different styles of writing, and they all work. There’s stream-of-consciousness, there’s a cool monologue by a hooker who has a fantastic voice that is wise, funny, and sad. And then there’s just plain eloquent and jazzy text that flows so well, I was just in heaven.Here are a few quotes. It was hard to pick among the zillion gems.From the hooker’s monologue:They got businessmen come in for a day. Whiteys. In tighteys. They lift up their shirts, you can smell the husband panic off them, like their wife is gonna come out of the TV set.From a Park Avenue woman whose son died in the Vietnam War:No newspapers big enough to paste him back together in Saigon. She takes another long haul, lets the smoke settle in her lungs—she has heard somewhere that cigarettes are good for grief. One long drag and you forget how to cry. The body too busy dealing with the poison. No wonder they gave them out free to the soldiers. Lucky Strikes.One of McCann’s many wise comments:Afterward, Gloria said to her that it was necessary to love silence, but before you could love silence you had to have noise.I read McCann's short stories last year, Thirteen Ways of Looking. I loved it too, which led me to this book. I want to read more more more of his stuff. Absolutely.So even though I got bored occasionally with a character who left me cold, mostly I loved this book to pieces. It’s about love and grief and bravery, and it really affected me. And it’s one of those books that inspires me to write, makes me want to play with words. I do think it’s a true masterpiece. And it’s not McCann’s fault that I got dizzy—though next time I’d prefer it if he kept things lower, more like ground level."
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4119460-aubrey,Rating 5 out of 5,"Have you ever heard Gershwin's 'Rhapsody in Blue'? That first low note of the clarinet that increasingly vibrates on the ground before it jumps high, high to land with a soft boom of drums and a smooth backdrop of horns, a building for the clarinet to continue on with trills and soars, till finally the zenith is reached and the horn sounds its own quavering, the robust tone completing that architecture first sounded by the leaping thrills of the lone clarinet.I am hardly the first to see this piece as a musical caricature of New York, but it is certainly a first for me to be reading and find my mind setting down notes as quickly as my eyes can scan in words. In addition, I have never even been to New York. So, what does it mean when an author is able to convey through simple prose the pulse of a city by appealing to a piece of work that, while in a separate sensory dominion, is as evocative as that far off metropolis whose sheer force of character gives it more personality than can sometimes be believed? It means they have a rare talent indeed.But, in my mind, this book is better than the music, and that's not just my heavy inclination towards literature talking. Gershwin certainly conjures up the city, but it is New York at her best and brightest, just as it was masterfully portrayed in Fantasia 2000's animated rendition. As cheering and catchy as that sort of persona is, it is not nearly all of New York. I may have never walked the streets, but I believe that the author created each character that does with thoughtful consideration, and more importantly, empathy.Vagabond priest, graffiti connoisseur, prodigy computer, mathematician griever, tortured artist in the least cliché sense of the phrase, the very embodiment of the words 'doomed by forces beyond one's control', and so many others. All drawn together by the wire-keeper, the sky-walker, the acrobat that took a city by storm and followed a passion that, as whimsical as its beginnings, had by its end reverberated its way through the hearts of millions and the pages of history books. This event may be the cornerstone, ferocious in its freedom and exuberant in its sheer existence, but the archway that encompasses it is filled with others whose raisons d'être are no less complex or beautiful in their individual craftships. While the tightrope artist's story is inspiring, it is also a single side to the jewel of New York. It takes the stories of all those caught up with the single event to showcase all the other emotions and turns of fate that the city has at its disposal. Love, loss, pursuit of the broken dream, denial of the empty fate, conforming to ones lot life in every second that passes, judging others with every breath and not even the bare minimum of context. Finding, despite all that, a small measure of closure, one that the author neither saturates for emotional impact, nor biases in order to pass along personal prejudices.Before I end this, I must admit that I didn't expect all this from a book highly lauded by the public eye. Shows how much I know. In fact, this book easily fits the bill as a gateway drug for the more esoterically architectured pieces of literature, the ones with endless streams of sentences and many plots scurrying around a story that is more concerned with structure and themes, and yet still has time to lovingly craft the characters sailing along the lines of print. So, if you have an eye on those larger-than-life tomes but are hesitant on committing to them too soon, try this one. Chances are, it will sing out in a joyous harmony for you as much as it did for me.
The core reason for it all was beauty. Walking was a divine delight. Everything was rewritten when he was up in the air. New things were possible with the human form. It went beyond equilibrium.He felt for a moment uncreated. Another kind of awake.

9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,Rating 4 out of 5,"A tightrope walker about to pull off one of the biggest stunts ever performed. A committed priest too busy looking out for the downtrodden to take care of himself. A pair of prostitutes who are also mother and daughter. A rich woman crippled by grief and her stoic judge husband. A couple of artists who fled the New York night life. Computer hackers. A brutal car wreck. Slums. Penthouses. Robbery. Charity. It’s either another day in New York, or it’s the shittiest circus ever.In 1974, a French acrobat named Philippe Petit made even jaded NewYorkers take notice when he illegally rigged a tightrope between the not-quite-finished World Trade Center towers and then spent the better part of an hour walking it over 1300 feet in the air. In fact, he didn’t just walk the tightrope, he danced, hopped and ran across it as well as laying down on the wire on his back at one point.Petit’s stunt momentarily captivated the city, and Colm McCann uses that event as the center of a web of intriguing stories about a group of people from all walks of life find themselves unknowingly impacting each other. McCann shifts to a variety of different perspectives, even switching from first person to third person. Whether the narrator is a male Irish immigrant or a black female hooker or a Hispanic single mother, all the voices seem authentic and unique and all of them offer up differing world views that still share a common theme of trying to cling to what they love.My favorite parts are the interludes where McCann describes Petit’s preparations and the walk itself. Petit was no Jackass-style daredevil. He spent over a year of careful planning and practicing for the moment when he and his crew could sneak to the top of the towers and rig the tightrope. The descriptions of the calm that fell over Petit as he stepped out on the wire and then proceeded to put on a show for the New Yorkers watching far below is almost enough to give a reader vertigo just trying to picture it. And of course, the shadow of 9/11 hangs over the book with the reader knowing that Petit practically walked on air at an incredible height between two objects that don’t even exist any more. This is some top notch writing with a powerful story of how one man’s desire for a transcendent moment can spin off into more directions than anyone can possibly imagine."

And not one emotion but a hundred. & important to these people, for the while, in a very democratic piece of literature. A true valentine to NYC--a jisgaw puzzle of faces that come from different places. They all look up in awe; we look down in equal amazement at the power of this grand American epic."
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2933855-brina,Rating 5 out of 5,"One of my favorite photographs I have of my mom is on a family trip to New York in 1994. We are on a boat going to Ellis Island and she is smiling, giddy, the Manhattan skyline in the background. A native New Yorker, this was our first trip back to New York in over ten years. The twin towers are prominent in the background, and little did she, or any of us, know that less than ten years later they would be gone, destroyed, obliterated in a puff of smoke. These images had not entered the fabric of our collective conscience in 1994; my mom was just another New Yorker happy to be home for a week. I know that my parents were not present in the gritty world that was New York City of 1974. They had just moved back from Israel and were moving on with their lives toward adulthood, their personal worlds spinning forward to another time and place. A few times in a generation, the world produces writers so gifted that they are beyond compare. One of these writers in the early 21st century is Colum McCann. His prose is like no other, and I have been reading through his novels every few months to space them out and savor their words. McCann was not present in 1974 New York either. Born in Dublin, he has called New York home for many years and writes about the city with as much care and love as he does about Ireland. He lived in Manhattan on September 11, 2001, and his father-in-law escaped the Twin Towers and successfully arrived at the McCann’s apartment. His loafers remained in McCann���s bedroom closet for years, a reminder of the towers that were and the resilient New York that would rebuild itself from the rubble. Let the Great World Spin is McCann’s opus that won the National Book Award in 2009. Although set on August 7, 1974, the novel, which features the Twin Towers front and center, is McCann’s way of grieving the terrorist attacks of 9-11. The great world of New York City spun before 9-11 and would keep spinning afterward. This National Book Award winning novel is New York transplant McCann’s take on the grittiness that comprised New York during the 1970s. Somnambulist Philippe Petit crossed the Twin Towers on a tightrope on August 7, 1974. Midtown Manhattan stopped spinning during his walk because they could not believe that there was a man in the sky. Books had been written about Petit before and McCann does feature him in the novel, but Let the Great World Spin is an ode to New York and what occurred there on that day while Petit transversed the sky. A theme of 1970s New York is that the Bronx was burning because government officials had let the borough go to pot. In 1974, the area above the Deegan Expressway was home to prostitutes and dilapidated project apartments. John Corrigan, known as Corrigan or Corrie, is a pseudo priest and member of an order that attempts to save the destitute of society from themselves. He has moved from Dublin to New York and made the prostitutes of the Bronx his own personal project. He chose to live among what others would call scum and opened his apartment to the hookers so that they could have a clean bathroom and cups of coffee during the night. The women of the night, a mother-daughter team named Tillie and Jazzlyn especially, loved Corrie, and he remained loyal to them, even when society had given up on them. He believed with love and perhaps a small dose of religion that even the prostitutes, good girls who had gone down the wrong path, could be redeemed by society. In August of 1974, Corrie’s brother Ciaran has just arrived from Dublin in hopes of making a new life for himself in New York. He finds Corrie’s station in life to be despicable and urges him to find a better place to live or to at least keep the prostitutes out of the apartment. Ciaran even comes with Corrie to his day job, driving a nursing home van, and witnesses the tender loving care that he gives to each resident. At the nursing home, Corrie is smitten with Guatemalan refugee and widow, a nurse named Adelita, who he playfully calls Adie to match his Corrie. Corrie’s core principles come to a nexus, much like Father Ralph in Coleen McCullough’s The Thorn Birds, as the priest is forced to choose between his vows and the one love of his life. Ciaran can feel the tension in his brother and hopes that for his sake that G-D will send a sign to make the choice for him. Ciaran is resigned to the fact that Corrie’s world spins around its own axis; he is happy living assisting the scum of society as life in New York moves on without him. Ciaran realizes that the Bronx is not the Manhattan that never sleeps that he has seen in images and, unlike Corrie, knows that Dublin is his home. While the Bronx prepares to burn three years later, grieving mothers of Vietnam soldiers converge to meet at a rap session at the Park Avenue apartment of one its members. Claire’s son Joshua was not your typical Vietnam conscript. An precursor to those who created Silicon Valley a generation later, Joshua was a Stanford graduate, computer genius and piano prodigy, who was asked by the government to hack into Saigon’s computers. Because this was in 1974 and not the 21st century, Joshua had to be stationed in a computer room in Saigon, until a detonated grenade cut his life short while he dined at a coffee house with army officers. Claire’s world felt as though it stopped spinning until she answered an ad to join the grieving mothers group, a group of middle class women in awe of her station in life that largely shut her out. Claire rationalizes her feelings to these women by noting that their boys must have been friends in Vietnam and are cavorting together in heaven. The only African American woman in the group, a lady from the Bronx named Gloria, lost all three of her sons to the war. She knows that her sons and Joshua probably never crossed paths but appreciates Claire’s gesture in a way the other women do not. Gloria goes against her better judgment and chooses to be Claire’s friend even though after August 7, 1974, the other ladies from distinct stations in life will probably never meet again; their world’s will keep spinning forward. One other storyline transverses the novel in Blaine and Lara, a post hippie, artist couple who decide to live in the 1920s and move off the grid to a lake side cabin in Poughkeepsie. Other than the grief group women, Blaine is about the least likable character for me; yet, their story is necessary in that is both far fetched, even for the 1970s, and it helps to bring the other storylines together. After writing this opus, McCann developed a formula that worked for him: dividing a novel into three or four sections, flushing out distinct characters and events in the first two parts, only to have everyone come together as the book reaches its denouement. Although formulaic, McCann’s prose is superior and his novels distinct stories, that this format does not seem trite. The world has to spin toward a point in time where people pick up their lives from the ashes: the hookers, the hippies, the early computer hackers, the grieving mothers. August 7, 1974 may have been a turning point in all of their lives, but eventually life has to go on, or it will stop at a standstill. At the book’s conclusion as characters from all of McCann’s storylines come together in a post 9-11 world to reveal how the world spun on from that one point in time and will keep spinning as the world exists. My edition of Let The Great World Spin contains an author interview with Colum McCann. Readers get an insight into his writing process as we learn that this novel was his ode to the resiliency of post 9-11 New York even though it was set in the past. McCann got his title from an Alfred Tennyson poem who got his idea from a 6th century epic poem by Arabic writer Mu’allaquat. Whether one is a hooker or nursing home worker from 1970s New York, a former New Yorker returning on a visit in 1990s New York, or a Dubliner who makes Manhattan home in 21st century New York, the city is comprised of resilient people who will continue to rebuild the city from tragedy. The world and its people will spin on through time. ✨ 5 star 🌎 read ✨"

About halfway, the vast list of characters telling their own chapters got a bit much, and I found myself not connecting or caring as much for each one, mostly since there had been SO MANY. The end tied up where everyone ended up in life, which I appreciated. I simply felt that the middle got a bit rambling and overambitious. "

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 are almost ten years old, and yet, the wound is still very raw (for those not directly involved, I mean; for those that were there, the wound is forever). Books and films that have dared touch the subject have done so in one of two ways: with near-stultifying decorum and gravity, which makes art into some kind of vague, patriotic duty; or with obliqueness, in which an artist makes a post 9/11 point without even mentioning 9/11. There's a good reason for this: any film or book that attempts to incorporate those events into ""entertainment"" are instantly condoned. Thus, nearly a decade on, the best works about 9/11 include two Spielberg films (Munich and War of the Worlds) and a television show (Lost). These have nothing to do with the actual events, yet have everything to do with the actual events. Let the Great World Spin is a 9/11 book that takes place in August 1974. It is a collection of interlocking stories strung together (natch!) by Philippe Petit's walk across a wire strung between the Twin Towers. This event had been mostly forgotten until the Towers fell, when suddenly Petit's walk became unbelievably poignant. Though author Colum McCann's story takes place long before the ghastly events of 9/11, before hijacked airliners, fireballs, and clouds of ash, and before Orange Alerts and the TSA and shoe-bombers and butt-bombers and all the rest, it is undeniably haunted by the future. This is made clear right at the start, when McCann describes the tumult caused by the wire-walker: [T:]he rumors began again, a collision of curse and whisper, augmented by an increase in sirens, which got their hearts pumping even more, and the helicopter found a purchase near the west side of the towers, while down in the foyer of the World Trade Center the cops were sprinting across the marble floor, and the undercovers were whipping out badges from beneath their shirts, and the fire trucks were pulling into the plaza, and the redblue dazzled the glass...It's almost as though he was describing something else... And if the point isn't hammered home enough, McCann later includes a photo of the wire-walker suspended between the Towers, with an airplane in the background. Yeah, it's not too subtle. But I'm not really sure what to make of the allusion, just as I'm not really sure what to make of the book. My enjoyment - and my internal Goodreads star-meter - ebbed and flowed as I made my way through. The book is designed to frustrate in this manner. In a way, it's more a collection of short stories than a novel. Each chapter is told from the point of view of a different character, utilizing first person and third person storytelling, and even a little second person for good measure. Among the various characters are Irish brothers Ciaran and John ""Corrie"" Corrigan, who live among the prostitutes of New York City; Claire and her husband Solomon, an upper middle class couple who have lost a son in Vietnam (Claire spends time with a support group, while Solomon is the Judge who arraigns an unnamed Philippe Petit); a South American nurse who's in love with Corrie; a black prostitute whom Corrie attempts to save; a young white girl named Lara who left her privileged upbringing to make time with a too-serious artist; and so forth. Petit shows up a couple times, in chapters that end the first two sections of the novel. Everything had purpose, signal, meaning. But in the end he knew that it all came down to the wire. Him and the cable. Two hundred and ten feet and the distance it bridged. The towers had been designed to sway a full three feet in a storm. A violent gust or even a sudden change in temperature would force the buildings to sway and the wire could tighten and bounce. It was one of the few things that came down to chance...The structure of this novel is nothing, well, novel. It employs the kind of set up utilized by any number of cut-rate books and movies (I'm looking askance at you, the Academy Award-winning Crash). Unsurprisingly, many of these characters meet and intertwine, in ways that are meant to surprise and enlighten; others share only a passing connection, perhaps as ephemeral as having both witnessed Petit's wire-walk. I'm not trying to be too down, here, because great care is taken in assembling thsi mosaic. Indeed, one of the enjoyments of the book is meeting a character, and later seeing that person through another character's eyes. I'm not a big short story guy, so that should factor into the relevance of this review. I prefer three acts and full arcs, rather than the precious snippets of illumination short stories ostensibly provide. As such, I was prone to frustration with Let the Great World Spin. Just as I was getting into a character (and actually figuring out who they were) the chapter would end and you'd jump into someone else's life. Often times, you never go back, and many character threads are left dangling forever. And, as with any short story collection, there is good and bad. Some chapters were really powerful, others felt like padding. (And the ending, which flashes forward to 2006, for a blah-blah-blah epilogue, is particularly bad. Joshua Ferris got smacked down for this in Then We Came to the End, yet McCann seems to have gotten a pass. He also won the National Book Award, while Ferris was only a finalist, so go figure). Maybe this is bitterness, but the book felt too perfect. To paraphrase Melville, I saw the author's foot on the treadle of the loom. There are times when you really notice the care taken with each word, but I don't mean this as a compliment. Despite having different characters narrate each chapter, all the voices sounded suspiciously the same: highly literate. This is a problem when you skip from an Irishman, to a prostitute, to a judge. Sure, there's an idiom here, and some slang there, and a little patois in the corner, but in general, everyone sounded the same. Moreover, McCann doesn't really play by his own rules. In one chapter, the narrator is describing his day at the beach, but then intercuts his story with a deadly car crash happening elsewhere. Now, this narrator wasn't in the car, so he wouldn't know what was happening, yet he describes the event as though he were in the passenger seat. Not only does he describe it, he describes it like National Book Award Winner Colum McCann: a sentence about the beach; a sentence about the car crash; a sentence about the beach; a sentence about the car crash. Back and forth like this. It's seamless and powerful writing, but it's supposedly coming from a guy who never made it far past high school. It's a quibble, to be sure, but it speaks to the lingering sensation I had, with every page, that I was reading something ""important."" I guess that would make the book ""self-important,"" which it really kind of is. "

The kinds of things that occasionally make you feel that you are connected to a greater web of being, a little sign to let you know that you are not in this alone. Two days before I picked up Colum McCann's extraordinary novel ""Let The Great World Spin,"" I watched the equally extraordinary documentary ""Man on Wire"" for the second time. Philippe Petit, more angel than human, strung a cable across the Twin Towers in 1974 and performed on it for over half an hour, walking, reclining, and literally dancing for the tiny human specks below and for the gods above (who could see him better, after all). It is a breathtaking sight, a man who has become art, who has made of himself something otherworldly and glorious. Like walking into a forest and seeing a unicorn or looking at the seashore and spotting a mermaid on a rock. It is therefore no wonder that the thread that ties together the vignettes in ""Let the Great World Spin"" is Petit's momentous tightrope walk as witnessed by the various residents of New York City. McCann introduces us to a number of these residents, some living gritty lives in the projects, others living lives of quiet luxury in a Park Avenue penthouse, still others trying to survive somewhere between the two extremes, in addresses less prone to preconception. And all of these residents are tied to the story and tied to the events of the day in ways that are sometimes obvious but more often as tenuous as a wire strung between buildings. But a wire that stretches. And holds. McCann's brilliance lies in the fact that each individual we meet is a revelation, a wholly expressed and vivid entity burnt onto our brain cells for all time. When we first meet the young Irish monk, Corrigan, living in a pit in the projects in order to try to protect the downtrodden, the hookers, and the elderly of the neighborhood, we jump into his world without a thought for our own safety, because we are smitten by his desire to bring goodness to bad places. As it turns out, he - and we - should have considered our safety a bit more carefully. So we learn straight off that some stories are not connected by so much as common addresses or economic status as they are by loss, by grief, by people left behind to trudge on when another's goals are left unfulfilled. Other characters will learn similar lessons, some by choice and others by circumstance, but McCann does not leave us behind like onlookers in a theater. He tells us these stories to make us look at our own and to consider the effect our lives have on the lives around us. Add to this ingenious structure the most perfect prose in modern literature and you have not a book, not a work of fiction, but an experience. McCann's stories are startlingly beautiful in many ways - their description, their construct, their gorgeous dissection of the dreams and memories of their characters. But the windows McCann opens, the doors he peers through, are just as often opening onto heartbreak as they are onto joy. Somehow, though, the grief and loss make the small tribulations and unexpected beauty that much more meaningful, the way a small remembrance can give us an inner photograph of our own unique definition of happiness. ""So much depends upon the red wheelbarrow..."", after all. McCann's characters allow us a glimpse of their sorrow and their happiness and let us decide if a balance has been achieved. That is, if the living of a life matters in the world, which is what McCann ultimately appears to be weighing in his fiction. Which is why he has allowed us glimpses into lives connected to other lives, and connected to other lives still, like the branches of an ever-expanding tree limb. How does this new person have an impact on the soul I have just become acquainted with, how can this person across town make a mark on the life of the one I just met in the Bronx? Late in the book one of our characters says, ""It had never occurred to me before but everything in New York is built upon another thing, nothing is entirely by itself, each thing as strange as the last, and connected."" Reading ""Let the Great World Spin"" makes me understand anew that we are all connected, that what we do matters, that our actions send ripples into the world that can affect other people in strange and unexpected ways. And every so often something stunning and remarkable happens that can bind us all together in sorrow or in joy. Like two planes hitting the Twin Towers. Or an angel walking between them. "

It is really a story about New York City in 1974 centered around Phillippe Petit's historic tight rope walk between the two towers of the World Trade Center. But the story itself trancends all that and takes us into the lives of some of the people whose days are coloured by this incredible feat and what unfolds is a powerful,complex tale of life, love, loss and redemption. I don't think I realized just how profound and deeply felt this story was until I had finished it. It will be some time, no doubt, before I am done thinking about all this book brings to bear. "

Not who, not why. How.How he bridged the unbridgeable, the chasm between those two monolithic structures. Spider-like, sending a thread that looks as delicate as silk from afar, but is strong enough to carry a man, a thread that connects the two separate giants.This took a wee while to work its magic. It is oblique, (which I like, but it can be unsettling), there are some oddly ugly metaphors - a sunset the colour of muscle. Yuk. It teeters perilously close to the edge of hokey cliché and manipulative tear-jerk - I mean, a fatal car crash? C'mon. But there I was thrown the lifeline of some breathtakingly well executed writing, which persuaded me to struggle back on board. There's more. There are more - a whole ensemble. And they start to come together, all these people, in unexpected ways. There are gossamer thin threads thrown across the void, threads that are delicate and easily broken, and as strong as a wire that can carry a man. They connect. They cross the void between those different worlds. It worked. "

Couple of reasons why: 1) The structure of the book--loosely connected novellas and stories--keeps the reader from getting to know any of the characters, constantly introducing new ones just when you get interested in the last, and totally abandoning a few who clearly have a lot more to say. 2) The component parts of the whole felt workshoppy--craft-wise, they're all a little too on the nose, and rarely did McCann offer any surprises to ameliorate how predictable all of it felt. 3) Many of the characters’ connections came off as forced vehicles to further the novel’s theme of inter-connectedness rather than as naturalistic development of plot or personality. 4) Not enough diversity of language to accommodate the diversity of the characters; at times, they all sounded alike and I would forget whose story I was reading.

Each chapter tells the story of a different character, and it gradually becomes clear that they are much more linked than seems the case early on. McCann's characters are rounded and sympathetic, covering a wide cross section of New York society. The central inspiration is Philippe Petit's high wire walk between the towers of the World Trade Centre, and his story has a symbolic resonance that links the remaining tales of survival. If I have a slight criticism it is that the last chapter, set in 2006, ties up the loose ends a little too neatly, but overall this was a very rewarding read."
19,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11255849-cheryl,Rating 4 out of 5,"Let the great world spin. And the great world of New York did indeed spin in this book. How do you view melancholy and heartbreak as something pure and beautiful and riveting and just plain astounding? You read Colum McCann's work, that's how. It was an orchestra of sorts--the many different voices and narratives. McCann writes with so much lyricism, he makes you want to dance with the tightrope walker the book opens with (taken from the true 1974 story of Philippe Petit, by the way). Three word sentences and then one-page paragraph. Almost no dialogue and then a three-page dialogue-only scene. Simply-structured sentences combined with complex word vines. The prose is a web of bemusement, much like the characters. Ireland, a city I love reading about ever since Frank McCourt made tales of Ireland (and what one might call the 'Irish dialect' in literature) alluring. Yet McCann does not even come close to writing about Ireland the way in which he writes about New York.The New York he describes, I see clearly. I was a teenaged immigrant when I lived in New York City. Though I was fortunate to have parents who swore to keep us out of the projects even though they had lost everything when they emigrated, I walked the streets of the projects with my high school friends in Queens, where I lived. I visited the Bronx with them, where mothers leaned out of windows speaking in code, asking their sons to buy things I had no idea of then until I saw small bags exchanged through palms. Walked the projects of Staten Island with friends who had just moved there after escaping war in their homelands. Went to church in the middle of what was then Brooklyn's worst projects; Bedsty. Watched while some of my friends never made it through high school and some were deported for bad behavior. Sometimes it all seems unnerving, as if someone handed me a skateboard and I skated through all of it in slow motion.Now here goes McCann, illuminating it all, reminding me. He speaks of prostitution, drugs, death, etc. But mostly, the book probes about life and consequences, life and the decisions we make, life--the good, the ugly, the beautiful, the painful. Ciaran Corrigan was my favorite character. Then Jaslyn; the daughter of Jazzlyn the prostitute. Ciaran told the twisted story of his brother, John Corrigan, who was a priest living in the projects with prostitutes, and somehow he became their best friend and angel. But even a priest has struggles and even his family must deal with tragedy. Through Ciaran's narration, I wanted to move with the book and never let it go. Until about 80 pages in when the parallel narration took Ciaran away from me and introduced another character.And this is the only problem I had. The parallel narratives seemed almost like short stories that were later stringed into a novel. And since McCann was a short story writer, that theory may not be too far off. There was the overarching theme of New York, yes, and there were characters whose lives were later intertwined yes, but don't look to be driven by some plot alignment. I love short stories but I hate when I'm reading a novel and it starts to feel like a short story collection. You come across so many characters--which, I admit, seems befitting for New York. Though when I got to Tillie's narration (the older prostitute) it seemed a bit inauthentic because the New York-African American dialect was off. Great book and an author whose masterful prose I will gladly seek.""The world spins. We stumble on. It is enough.""4.5 stars "
20,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62704-nate,Rating 4 out of 5,"I wanted to remember some of the lines from this book so I wrote them in my journal. I haven't read anything in a while that has made me ache. The loss in this book and the admiration the narrators have for the central figure is overwhelming as you read it. The author has obviously lost someone special and has captured that loss on paper. Just gorgeously written, especially the chapters titled Miro, Miro on the Wall and Centavos.SPOILERS AHOY AHOYTo describe this book would be misleading. It is a tale of interwoven characters who don't know how they connect, each chapter is written from a different point of view, and there's some play with the chronology of the plot. Pretty standard fiction fare nowadays. Let the Great World Spin feels different to me because it executes a Maris-on-Frasier relationship. We never hear from Maris or McCann's character Corrigan directly, but we get a fully fleshed out character from hearsay. In Corrigan's case, he just keeps getting more and more wholesome and that wholesomeness radiates through the other characters in the novel. That delicate kind of wholesome that isn't preachy or judgmental.To me, the character Corrigan illustrates the reason I dislike Oprah. He felt no need to wear his good deeds like a medallion - he did not do the tremendously kind things he did for his own self-esteem or for an audience. He did them because it was right. The fact that the reader learns of Corrie's philanthropy is solely because we hear it from other characters. He would never tell us these things if he were to narrate. He was a reminder to people who most needed reminding that there is still good in the world. Similarities can easily be drawn between him and the unnamed tightrope walker. I would like to write about the tightrope walker and Corrie's differences. We are told the tightrope walker's intentions for walking out between the Twin Towers were because the Towers were there to be walked between. Since this stunt took place before reality tv shows and 24 hour news channels, I can somewhat believe it. But somewhere in there he must have done it for notoriety, don't we all have some wish to be remembered, or at least have our 15 minutes of fame? That's the main difference to me between the tightrope walker and Corrie. The only reason this book didn't get a 5 star from me is because of the phreakers chapter. I'm still wrapping my head around it. I wouldn't say it was a mismatch to the rest of the book; but its reason for being included isn't as obvious. Communication and distance are definite themes of the novel. The beginnings of the internet seem like a good locale for that discussion - but the rest of the book was so tightly written; much more obvious in its motives. Plus there was always a tie in to other characters of the novel somehow in other chapters. Maybe I should read it again, because I don't think any of the people the phreakers got a hold of tied in."

Phillipe Petit's astonishing 1974 walk between the Twin Towers forms the centrepiece of the story, and in its shadow the lives of several characters intersect in surprising and intricate ways. Corrigan is one of its sprawling cast. A Dublin import, he is a man of God who makes it his mission to serve a congregation of prostitutes working the city's grimy streets. Tillie and her daughter Jazzlyn are among them, two women who would dream of a happier life if they didn't know better. Claire is a wealthy Park Avenue housewife, mourning the death of her son in Vietnam. At a group for grieving mothers, she meets Gloria, a strong and thoughtful woman who has suffered more heartache than most. And Lara is an aimless, coke-addicted artist who doesn't realise her life is about to change in the most profound way.Colum McCann does such an impressive job of weaving the stories together, a real high-wire act of his own. Some of their voices struck me more than others - Tillie's sorrowful account from a prison cell and Gloria's tale of courageous resilience were my favourites. McCann also brings a gritty 70s New York to life in a spectacular way, ""a city with its fingers in the garbage, a city that ate off dirty dishes."" Nitpickers might call the novel unfocused, but you have to admire its audacity and style. It's as mesmerizing as the tightrope theatrics that inspired it."

You cannot understand every line as you listen. Impossible. This is a book about life and how it whirls around you and how everything and everyone is interconnected. How can I describe this book..... it is poetry that does not rhyme. If I extract a few lines to show you, you will miss their import. They are part of the context, each line related to the next. Just as people are...Absolutely excellent narration. Some stories are fun. Some are sad. You get a perfect balance. You will not understand more if you read the paper book. To understand you have to stop and think and each one of us will come up with a different explanation. There is no right explanation. Do not be scared to read this book because you hear that is composed of different stories. It is, but they do all relate to each other. By the end you have learned about the lives of several disparate characters, maybe not every detail, but who they really are, what motivates and moves them. You see life and death and growth and disintegration and the world spins on with us little specks on the surface. But regardless of our smallness, we are each one of us important to each other. I loved this book.There are many other reviews out there. If you want to know the factual details of who does what and the role of each character, read another review. Me, I do not advise reading this book for its plot. I will just say this: Philippe Petit and his tightrope act between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, that is today now long gone, really did happen in NYC in 1974. The rest is wonderful, imaginative fiction. ******************Narrators: Richard Poe, Gerard Doyle, Carol Monda, Johanna Parker, Ramon de Ocampo, Chris Sorensen, Patricia R.

Colum McCann's novel captures the spirit of the place and the people eloquently and movingly, the despair and isolation, the community and the hope. The stories of a disparate group of New Yorkers are linked together by Philippe Petit's tightrope walk between the Twin Towers: a monk working among prostitutes in the Bronx; his brother, newly arrived from Dublin; one of the prositutes; a Park Avenue matron (Claire, perhaps named to echo Clarissa Dalloway of whom she reminded me a bit) reaching out uncertainly to other mothers of soldiers killed in Vietnam; her judge husband; and a couple of art world refugees. While a few of the sections (particularly one of computer hackers working on the early Arpanet) are weaker than the others, overall, this beautifully written book was one that I never wanted to end."
24,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6700518-lorna,Rating 5 out of 5,"Let the Great World Spin by Colum McCann was told in a non-linear fashion by several different narrators and each with some type of tangential relationship to the other characters in the book; some will become aware of that interrelationship while others may not. Most of the story unfolds over the course of several days and some events are told from many different perspectives. The narrative is primarily in New York City interspersed with a fictional narrative of the history-making feat of funambulist Phillipe Petit on August 7, 1974 when he walked across a tightrope strung between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. There is a photograph in the book that is somewhat prescient as there is a shadow of an airplane flying over the Twin Towers while Petit is making his way in this death-defying feat on the high-wire between the towers. This was a wonderful book and while this is the first book that I have read by this Irish author, it certainly won't be the last. Colum McCann notes that the title comes from the poem Locksley Hall by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. I will close with the words of Colum McCann:

It’s the natural, albeit overused, word for what McCann did so well: tell multiple stories about multiple people with multiple themes, focusing on one point-of-view at a time, but with enough overlap to bind them together. (I tried to come up with a more distinctive metaphor, but my spinning disc with multi-colored curves coming from the center like one of those psychedelic swirl lollipops smacked of trying too hard.)Anyway…This was a very good book. I liked the way it was structured, with Frenchman Philippe Petit’s historic walk on a tightrope between the Twin Towers in 1974 as the common strand in most of the stories. For any of you who saw Man on Wire, you know this was a pretty cool, real-life event. McCann’s 10 other stories seemed like they could have been true, too. With millions of stories in the Naked City to work with, the challenge was to come up with a representative subset. And to combine them in the manner of a spinning disc with multi-colored curves coming from the center like one of those psychedelic swirl lollipops. (OK, I see it now: “weave” truly is better.)The cast of characters is as engaging as it is varied. We meet a modern-day urban monk, his brother from Ireland, mother-daughter prostitutes with hearts of something less clichéd than gold (though not like greasy black banana peels either), an unfortunate society lady whose son had been in Vietnam, her husband the municipal judge, her new friend in a support group who didn’t know quite what to make of her (with race as a complicating factor), the nerdy developers who gave birth to the internet, an art photographer with a specialty in tagging, an artistic couple with integrity in varying degrees, and the daughter of one of the hookers, sent away and now grown, returning to tie up a few of the stories’ loose ends. Phillippe features, too, though not always as a focal point. The writing, I thought, was top notch. The plots were engrossing and the descriptions gave a real sense of time and place. Plus, McCann lays out his words with a real rhythmic flair. Spun or woven, read and enjoy."

As a Dubliner his respect for James Joyce clearly was both obligatory and immense: it would be unpatriotic to show anything less than enduring homage to the greatest literary novelist of the 20th century when Colum, himself, aspired to be the same in the 21st. So at the end of his discourse, ending with the caution that one should ""Try not to be a dick,"" he asked for questions. So I raised a hand to posit a singularly dickish question, indeed, the most dickish question ever conceived to spring upon a good natured Irishman, as he certainly appeared to be. My question: ""If James Joyce based 'Ulysses' upon story lines emanating from Homer's 'Odyssey,' then how is plot juvenile?"" I know, I blush to recall such dickishness in a Pantheon of the Ivy League, no less. But his response was inspiring: ""It's all about the words,"" said Colum. ""It's all about the words."" So a long queue forms to buy his paperback novels and gain a valued autograph: a man of the blue collar has to make a living, after all. So I sally forth near the head of the line and buy three novels for him to sign, including ""Let the Great World Spin."" Waiting patiently, my turn finally comes to shake hands with someone I have never before read or even heard of. I see from his bio that he teaches Creative Writing at CUNY and is, as expected, a James Joyce aficionado of the first order. I identify myself straight-away: ""I'm the dick who asked you the question about the plot of 'Ulysses.' I try but sometimes cannot help myself when it comes to being a dick."" He politely replies, ""I know."" And he smiles beneath his pork pie hat. Because now I am redeemed as a patron, a sponsor, a book buyer holding three of his award-winning novels, chosen randomly, in my hand. ""My daughter graduated from CUNY. Hunter College. An English major. I hope to live long enough into my 90's to pay back the college loans for tuition as she was an out-of-state student (CT)."" He smiles, again. ""I asked you my question to draw you out on the value of plot. Because I wrote the American sequel to 'Ulysses' and its humble plot follows naturally from James Joyce and Homer."" So he pauses and asks, ""What's it called?"" I answer, ""'Bloomsday: The Bostoniad.' The novel takes place in Boston after the War in Vietnam."" This response resonates with Colum McCann at Yale. ""What's your favorite quote from 'Ulysses'?"" he wants to know. I reply, that it's the last one of the novel by Molly Bloom: ""yes I said yes I will Yes."" So he pens into the novel a brief note to me in ""Let the Great World Spin"": ""perhaps, I said, perhaps."" Then he gives me the name of a connection in Dublin to whom I should send the manuscript of ""Bloomsday"" if I'm interested in foreign rights. I am. So I send the MS to his connection and I hear nothing after a heroic couplet of months. Although I may be an occasional dick, I am also a patient man. So while possibly waiting for Godot, I read Colum's novel, which has won a National Book Award and guess what? It turns out to be a masterpiece literary novel. The ultimate compliment I can give to any novel is that I wish I had written it. And so it is with ""Let the Great World Spin."" It's a genius work ending with these words of wisdom: ""The world spins. We stumble on. It is enough."" If you have better advice, I would love to hear it. For the love of all that's holy, write me, Brendan. And try not to be a dick."

But maybe that's just on me. I admire what he accomplished; I didn't care for his style (at times) of short, choppy sentences, cryptic philosophizing and cloying sentiment. With all the 5 star reviews, my hopes were high, maybe too high and I finished this feeling largely unsatisfied. A generous 3 stars"

Mi sono lasciata ingannare da frasi e commenti letti qua e là, dall'idea, a mio avviso completamente sbagliata, che anche questo di Colum McCann, fosse l'ennesimo tentativo di romanzo in racconti.Solo alla fine ho compreso che «Questo bacio vada al mondo intero» è un romanzo tutto intero, e che la continua ricerca da parte mia di un centro che non era il centro, o il punto di fuga scelto da McCann, mi aveva fatto osservare il romanzo dal punto di vista sbagliato.Sia chiaro, McCann ce la mette tutta per spiazzare il lettore, per confonderlo, sballottandolo da una parte all'altra del mondo e di New York in una continua concatenazione e simultaneità di eventi, di flashback improvvisi, di eventi che sembrano essere completamente scollegati gli uni dagli altri, di storie che appaiono inizialmente solo essere schegge di vita impazzite, ma che invece hanno tutte un senso, un legame, che seguono tutte uno stesso disegno unitario, hanno tutte un filo che le lega: ma non è il filo al quale state pensando, non vi lasciate ingannare.E così, fedele a quella teoria secondo la quale «il battito d'ali di una farfalla in Brasile può provocare un tornado in Texas», McCann nasconde il centro del romanzo al lettore e lo porta a scoprirlo lentamente, attraverso le vite scombinate di Corrigan, uno strano monaco di strada che ha lasciato Dublino per seguire la sua vocazione e metterla al servizio delle prostitute e degli anziani diseredati del Bronx, a quella di suo fratello che lo raggiunge sin là, attraversando l'oceano per cercare anche lui il centro della propria vita, a quella di quattro donne che hanno perso in Vietnam i loro figli, a quelle di Laura e suo marito ex tossici e artisti che dopo una mostra dall'esito fallimentare stanno tornando alla loro abitazione poco fuori città, a quella di uno scombinato gruppetto di programmatori che dalla lontana California, nel pieno della notte, chiama una cabina di New York per sapere se è proprio vero quello che si dice, che proprio in quel momento, il 7 agosto del 1974, c'è un uomo che cammina su un cavo di acciaio sospeso tra le due Torri Gemelle a oltre cento metri di altezza dal suolo.È Philippe Petit, ci racconterà la storia, quella vera (e a chi non l'avesse ancora visto consiglio la visione dello splendido documentario «Man on wire» ) ma per McCann è solo un'altra vita che intreccia la sua a quelle dei suoi personaggi, l'uomo sul filo, un artista, un acrobata, l'uomo che per una decina di minuti camminerà, ballerà, si stenderà su quel cavo di acciaio lasciando New York a testa in su a sognare e a palpitare, a indignarsi e ad applaudire. Anche lui è dentro la storia, l'uomo sul filo, anzi è dentro e sopra la storia, ne è parte integrante e osservatore inconsapevole che balla su New York e sul mondo, proprio su quel mondo che sotto di lui «gira in vortici infiniti».È questo il mondo di McCann, i suoi vortici infiniti, le sue storie che esplodono come in un big bang improvviso, come palle di un biliardo a inizio partita che schizzano in tutte le direzioni, sbattendo l'una contro l'altra, determinando l'una il destino dell'altra, per dare vita al suo romanzo, un romanzo vero, in tutti i sensi.Eppure non mi ha convinta fino in fondo, e a non convincermi, mi accorgo, non è stata tanto la fatica di aspettare che tutti i pezzi combaciassero tra loro, di cercare di trovare il nesso tra storie e personaggi, oppure la presunta mancanza di unitarietà della storia, il cercare di trovare, alla fine, il famoso centro di cui scrivevo all'inizio (e che non rivelerò, a ciascuno la propria fatica e niente spoiler), quanto piuttosto uno stile altalenante e disomogeneo, che alterna parti bellissime, come le prime quaranta cinquanta pagine, ad altre che invece, secondo me, sono più deboli e che non riescono a mantenere alta l'attenzione, o a creare l'attesa e il desiderio di proseguire nella lettura; per poi infine tornare, a circa centocinquanta pagine dalla fine, al livello iniziale.È bello, sì, ma non tutto, il piacere della lettura non è costante, come costante non è la bellezza dello stile di scrittura, ma è proprio come a quel mondo tutto intero, bello e brutto, e che gira in vortici infiniti, al quale McCann manda comunque un bacio: un mondo che troppo spesso fatica a restare in equilibrio e in cui ogni vita lotta incessantemente per non cadere nel vuoto, al punto da non riuscire ad alzare gli occhi per sorridere alla vista di un uomo che cammina sul filo, o a riconoscerne la bellezza. Se non da lassù, dove tutto è silenzio, e vento.(Ecco ce l'ho fatta, pensavo non sarei più riuscita a scriverlo questo commento!)"

Purtroppo la mia fame “letteraria” non va di pari passo con le mie entrate. Così, i libri che invece decido di acquistare sono il frutto di un lungo corteggiamento, che passa attraverso le recensioni, sguardi fugaci attraverso le vetrine della libreria, ricerca di note sull'autore. A volte prendo delle cantonate incredibili, a volte no. A volte come in questo caso, raggiungo l'apoteosi del mio “baratto figurato”. Immagino i soldi che consegno direttamente nelle mani dell'autore, e corrispettivamente immagino l'autore che mi fa scivolare nella mano un pugno di emozioni che entrano nel mio animo. Allora la beatitudine mi si stampa in viso, e passo i giorni dopo aver chiuso il libro a rigirarmelo tra le mani, come un innamorato maneggia fino a consumarla, la prima lettera d'amore ricevuta.C'è chi con la carta fa origami a forma di gru. Se vengono bene puoi tenerle nella mano e stanno in piedi da sole. C'è chi con le parole fa origami a forma di storie. Se vengono bene ti attraversano il cuore, senza bisogno di chiederti la chiave. E questo romanzo è pieno di origami. È pieno di storie palpitanti. Un equilibrista le guarda dall'alto e le congela in un'istantanea a colori. Noi non facciamo altro che leggere il puzzle che compone quella foto. Storie e vite in bilico come il funambolo che le contempla senza vederle.. in bilico tra presente e futuro, tra dolore ed espiazione, tra errori atavici e salvezza, tra disperazione e riscatto, tra amore sudicio e amore immacolato. Ma alla fine del libro, proprio all'ultimissima pagina la consapevolezza è una sola.. che c'è una fede che a volte non sappiamo di avere, ed è una fede connaturata alla nostra stessa esistenza, che cammina sempre sopra una corda tesa sul nulla, e sulla fune siamo in perfetta solitudine, noi e la nostra fede in qualcosa. E chi se ne frega dei nostri buoni propositi, delle nostre intenzioni, possiamo sempre cadere da un momento all'altro, ma possiamo anche arrivare alla fine del filo; e se ci arriviamo, chi ci tende la mano è proprio lei, la fede, la meta, l'amore, l'amicizia, la serenità, tutte facce di una stessa medaglia. Una piccola medaglia, quasi una monetina da 5 centesimi, che possiamo deporre sulla linea dell'orizzonte durante il tramonto, e accorgerci che ha la stessa forma del Sole.Una frase per tutte: ""C'è chi pensa che l'amore sia la fine della strada, e che se si è abbastanza fortunati da trovarlo ci si ferma lì. Altri dicono che è come un burrone nel quale si precipita. Ma chiunque abbia vissuto almeno un po' sa che muta con il passare dei giorni, e secondo l'energia che gli si dedica, lo si conserva o ci si aggrappa, oppure lo si perde, ma a volte capita che non sia nemmeno mai stato lì, sin dall'inizio.""

Heck, I was just trying to save folks some precious reading time; doubt reading this will affect your like or dislike of the book. But watch for the WARNINGS.UPDATE.After some colleagues urged me to try it again, I plowed on, finished it, and am willing to move it up to 3 stars. Well written, but still too disjointed, hopping from one unfinished vignette to another, the connections being too loose or too forced for me to enjoy. The characters were too one-dimensional. (SPOILER ALERT, avert your eyes until the end of the paragraph!!) The ending seemed pretty lame to me as well--the slacker brother becomes a rich software mogul married to the avant-garde artiste whose former husband (and whatever happened to him? he could have become a junkie male hooker and become a part of the cast of that story, or maybe found God and took up where Corrigan left off, ministering to the hookers...) caused the wreck that led to the death of the too good to be true priest and the junkie hooker, who is redeemed by having a decent daughter, thanks to the efforts of the smart and sensitive but downtrodden black lady who was part of the informal support group of moms who'd lost sons in Vietnam, one of whose members was the Park Avenue wife of the judge who sentenced the hooker grandmother to jail...(OK to start reading again) ...blah blah blah. My friends cried at the end. I was sad I hadn't spent time on a better book.(The Old)Another critically acclaimed work of ""literate"" fiction that I've left unfinished. I couldn't even get through the first of the sub-stories, that of the devoted-to-celibacy, -poverty, etc. Irish monk living in squalor among the drug addicts/prostitutes of Harlem, as narrated by his slacker brother. Their characters as boys interested me, but the story of life in Harlem just dragged on, and eventually I got bored. Never got to the other stories and their connections to the first."

I was into it right away and then I didn't even want to pick it up for a solid week...overall I liked it but there were a couple stories I really struggled through, and those same ones were the characters I struggled to like or connect with at all, in particular, Tillie. While the book was fiction, I had no idea that the tightrope walker incident was a true event.I was pleased with the book for the most part but there was definitely a struggle for me to eventually arrive there. Even with a mixed reaction to the story, I can undoubtedly say, Colum McCann has a way with words. His writing was so simple yet eloquent. If I were a writer, this is the type of writing I'd aspire to create. And as a reader, it was very enjoyable. Just simple but impactful:""The simple things come back to us.

36,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2231715-lewis-weinstein,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is the current read of our Cayo Hueso Literary Salon. I've just read through the reviews of my GR friends, mostly 4* and 5*. From somewhere among those reviews, I have the thought that this book shows that each of us, at some time in our lives, approaches the high wire of life, if we dare, fraught with opportunity and danger. Now to read the book.BTW, if you haven't seen it, I recommend you see MAN ON THE WIRE. Netflix has it.I have read the first chapter, dealing with the two Corrigan brothers from Ireland who have ended up in the Bronx. It is beautifully structured and written but oh, so depressing. These guys are leading a life that is surely precariously balanced on a high wire of their own making. Along the way, there is fascinating reflection on our opportunity and need to relate to God, who may or may not hear what we say/think, and also on the impact of the vow of celibacy, troubling to all of us, not just priests, in light of the sexual abuse of children by supposedly celibate priests.The 2nd chapter is very powerful and no less depressing. A litany of deaths, by every means imaginable. Falling off the wire. Angry at the man on the wire. ""How dare he do that with his own body? Throwing his life in everyone's face? Making her own son's death seem so cheap? Yes, he has intruded on Claire's coffee morning. Now that I've finished the book... My reaction to it is more positive, but not unreservedly so. Let's start with the positives. The writing continued to be superb. McCann has a marvelous ability to describe a setting or a character. The emotional content also increased, as we are shown stirring human values even in substantially wasted lives. And the ending actually provided a slice of hope, evidence that rising from the slime is possible, given coordinated and persistent love and effective help from even one or two people who care.But ... The author challenged himself with a literary walk on the high wire, and in my view did not make it to the other side. The story is not told in a linear fashion. The time frame jumps forward and backward as often as the point-of-view character changes. As other GR readers have said, it is more a series of somewhat linked short stories than it is a novel. Almost every new scene was confusing and, to me, irritating. Who is this unnamed person? Where does he/she fit? Is this event happening before or after the last time we met this character? Even if this confusion was resolved within a page or two, it nevertheless unbalanced the flow of my reading. By the time that flow was reestablished, the scene was over and another scene created a new disruption. The lack of a single protagonist to carry the emotion of the story made the unsettling disruptions worse. Every time I began to feel something, the story line and character which had evoked those feelings disappeared and the emotion dissipated. I could never really settle in to enjoy the story. Was this the author’s intent?A clue to this intent is found in the interview with the author at the end of the book. ""Did you envision the whole plot of this book in advance?"" he is asked. McCann answers, “I just got happily lost over and over again! It’s a fairly intricate maze, but I never mapped it out, it just kept unfolding for me. There were times I didn’t feel like I was writing it at all. I was being blown around by twelve different voices.” The result of this haphazard approach was unsatisfying for me. Some confusion is fine, but I don't like a book totally structured that way. Had the high wire guy prepared in that manner, he would never have gotten to the top of the towers, and would surely have fallen off if he had. My conclusion: many pieces of ""Let The Great World Spin"" were well researched and beautifully told, but for me the whole was less than its parts. It's hard to decide when there are such disparate elements, but I end up with 3*."

Не зная дали читатели, които нямат специално отношение към града, биха се въвлекли толкова в историите. Сега няма да разказвам за връзката ми с града (само това, че редовно го сънувам). Но още повече разбирам защо толкова много писатели, музиканти, кинаджии са писали така за него – имам цяла колекция от мисли, посветени на New York.А „Нека светът се върти“ е като паяжината на живота. Не на всеки автор се получава преплитането на различни съдби и герои. Или поне на мен често ми е трудно/досадно да чета книги с подобен подход – привидно различни нишки, които в даден момент се заплитат. Сега ми беше много любопитно и плавно с това пресичане на парчетата живот – движение, срещане, разминаване, заминаване. И оставане разбира се.Помислям си това за паяжината и чак след това се вглеждам по-внимателно в корицата. До този момент за мен тя беше: забележителните женски крака и въжеиграчът. Чудно защо чак накрая видях и своеобразната паяжина на корицата – не в онази идеална позната форма, а разпръсната и изненадваща като преплитанията между човешките съдби в реалността. В някои моменти в началото ми дотежаваше като виждах, че предстои да се запозная с нов герой и неговата история, но бързо свиквах. Според някои от критериите ми за хубава книга „Нека големият свят се върти“ се оказа точно такава:-  Развълнува ме  – не съм плакала на книга може би от „Животът пред теб“ на Ромен Гари.-  Героите  – почти всички ми станаха близки, дори някои да се появяваха за малко.Още повече се сближих с проститутките – първо като ги видях на витрините в Червения квартал в Амстердам; последва (отново ще спомена тази книга) „Животът пред теб“; а сега Тили & Джазлин. „Любовта не е по-малко любов, когато си проститутка, изобщо не е.“Повярвах и на мигновените свързвания.  Клеър и Глория; Джазлин и Пино; Киаран и Лара. Естествено Кориган ми беше неразбираем. Толкова съм далече от тази религиозност – за хубаво или не. Всичко, което е наложено като правила и задължения, ми е чуждо. Но и тази безусловна хуманност, приемането на всяка жива душичка. Дали събитията говореха за „невъзможното щастие“, „непозволеното щастие“. Надявам се – не. Много щастия бяха позволени. Нека големият свят се върти!-  Стилът на Маккан ми хареса. Въпреки че на моменти използването на поредица от кратки безглаголни изречения ми стоеше като „придобито“, не съвсем естествено. (Веднъж като съм видяла един „трик“, при следващ писател ми изглежда неоригинално. Разбира се никой няма авторски права над различните литературни похвати. Така че и Маккан се възползва добре от безглаголните изречения, само на места в пряката реч сякаш забравя, че трябва да остави този начин на писане, все пак говорят героите със собствения си стил.)„Глория на смъртния ѝ одър преди шест години. Спокойното пътуване до Мисури. Усмивката на лицето на Глория. Сестра ѝ, Джанис, на шофьорското място. Игрите с огледалото за обратно виждане.“ Но например в главата за Тили нейният жаргон си е съвсем на място. С идеален превод. Често съм срещала „пресилен“ жаргон в преводите. Ясно, че е трудно да се отрази този по-специфичен език, но понякога има прекаляване, може би за да са сигурни преводачите, че се усеща тази специфичност.- Мястото и епохата  са отразени добре, без това да е натрапчиво и отделено от действието. Символиката на двете кули, „осиротелите“ майки след войната във Виетнам; няколко изречения за войната в Ирак. „Ако ти кажат мирно, по-добре затанцувай. Ако ти кажат да изгориш знамето, по-добре го развей. Ако ти кажат да убиваш – създавай.“И – градът. New York City!„Адвокати. Оператори на асансьори. Доктори. Чистачи. Готвачи. Търговци на диаманти. Продавачи на риба. Проститутки в джинси. Всеки от тях успокоен от присъствието на останалите. Стенографи. Търговци. Разносвачи. Мошеници. Кон Ед. Ма Бел. Уолстрийт. Шлосер в микробуса си на ъгъла на Дей и Бродуей. Куриер с велосипед, опрян върху лампа на Уест. Червендалест пияница, излязъл за сутрешно питие.“- Дали книгата  ще остане трайно в/с мен – още не зная.За харесването допринесоха и още няколко фактора:- Нямах никаква представа „за какво се разказва“ в книгата – нито за структурата, нито за историята. Понякога като знам по нещичко за нечетена книга, се създават очаквания, нагласи. Сега – от нулата.- Никога не бях чувала за Филип Петѝ. В началото си мислех, че е „само на книга“. Още тогава ми се завиваше свят - изпитвам паника от височини от порядъка дори на 5 метра. Като разбрах, че „това е истина“, дълго не откъсвах очи от снимките на французина на въжето горе. „Устоите на логиката се разклатиха. Времето престана да съществува. Тялото му с години бе предусещало свистенето на вятъра горе.“С непрекъсната мисъл за още нещо – че кулите вече ги няма. Двете кули – с години преживявах атентатите. Ако може да се нарече преживяно. И ако може дори леко да се сравни с преживяното от самите пострадали/загинали и близките им…„Мъж високо в небето, докато самолет сякаш потъва в ръба на сградата. Парченце история среща друго парченце, по-голямо. Сякаш човекът върху жицата някак е очаквал онова, което ще се случи по-късно. Нахлуването на времето и историята. Сблъсъкът на истории. Очакваме експлозията, но тя така и не се случва. Самолетът отминава, въжеиграчът достига края на въжето. Светът остава цял.“Най-точната дума за книгата може би е тази, която използвам рядко – увлекателна. Защото обикновено не търся точно увлекателност. А сега ме интересуваше как ще се развият историите, какво ще стане с героите. Само на главата за Соломон (в Съда) охладнях – стори ми се типично американска като език и „манталитет“. За съжаление доста се проточи четенето поради липса на време, само вечер по мъничко полузаспала. Мисля, че е хубаво книгата да не се чете с големи прекъсвания (при второто появяване на една от героините бях забравила какво е първото ѝ споменаване.)Любимите ми малки изречения:„Особеното на любовта е, че ни кара да оживяваме в чуждо тяло.“ „Почувства, че ѝ се иска майка ѝ да е била влюбена поне веднъж в живота си.“„Пътека в косата ми. Влизането забранено.“„Харесва думичката майка и всички усложнения, свързани с нея.“Май е книга за любовта?И още едно любимо изречение, но го загубих в книгата, намерих го тук в оригинал:„The air suddenly felt shared.“"

Ci sono libri che mentre li leggi pensi a quanto ti sarebbe piaciuto se fossi stato tu a scriverli. Libri che, volente o nolente, esercitano su di te una forza, come dire - narrativa? di una potenza inimmaginabile. Un brano specifico può farti scoppiare in lacrime. Quando apri questi libri per la prima volta ancora non lo sai. Alla fine, ti rimangono le emozioni.Questo libro parla di persone. Non è un romanzo d'amore. Comunque, il titolo italiano, sebbene differente da quello originale, è più che azzeccato. Le vite narrate in questo romanzo parlano di persone bisognose di amore e di baci. A volte sarebbe bastato poco per cambiare loro la vita. Ma quasi sempre sono costrette a rimanere chiuse nella sofferenza, la perdita, il rimorso, la morte interiore. Ogni persona ha perso se stessa. O ha perso una persona cara. O ha perso le proprie convinzioni. Attraverso un processo salvifico, che è quasi sempre l'amore, queste persone possono tornare a sorridere. Vivere felici, non rassegnate, mai rassegnate, quel che manca loro da vivere. Accettano il dolore e lo rendono una base fondamentale del loro carattere. La vita ci viene raccontata con uno stile fresco, fluido, contemporaneo. Si adatta a ogni personaggio, con le dovute sfumature. Drammatico e straziante (ma bellissimo, forse il più bello) il secondo capitolo, ""Mirò, Mirò, delle mie brame"". Un monaco di strada, alcune prostitute, madri che hanno perso i figli in Vietnam, artisti persi nella droga. Sono le vite dei reietti messe a confronti con il lusso di Park Avenue. È il sentimento umano in tutti i suoi rami contorti. La comprensione sta nelle parole. La dolcezza delle storie, del raccontare. Il dialogo e la confessione come metodo di espiazione del peccato. Abbiamo bisogno di aprirci, di piangere, di amare, di baciare la persona che ci piace, di correre, saltare, vivere, urlare che siamo capaci di andare avanti nonostante tutto. Questo è ciò che dice il romanzo alla fine. È un inno alla vita. Usa il dolore per farci vivere. Abbracciare il nostro amico. Sorridere a uno sconosciuto. Prendere la sofferenza, la morte di coloro che amiamo e metterla dentro di noi, ma in fondo in fondo, dove non la può vedere nessuno, dove è solo nostra e di chi ci ha ascoltato, in modo che la vita possa tornare a splendere, perché tutti ci meritiamo che per un po' splenda per noi.""C'era in lei la bellezza dei vinti""."

Descriptions included magical, sweeping, brilliant, poignant and the perfect New York novel. I am definitely out of step when it comes to current fiction because I missed the magic here - finding this book more style than substance.The book is a set of vignettes chronicling a loosely connected set of Manhattanites in August of 1974. In the background are the Vietnam War, Nixon’s resignation and Phillipe Petit- a man who stretched a cable between the World Trade Twin Towers - 103 stories up in the air - and went for a stroll – successfully. Our cast includes two Irish brothers; one a catholic priest, who lives among and befriends a pack of heroin addicted prostitutes; a grieving mother who lost her son in the Vietnam War; and a young married couple trying to break into the NY art world in between cocaine binges. Not the most original or creative set of characters, but with a good story to guide them great novels can be made. Unfortunately, and this is the biggest fault I had with Let The Great World Spin, the author doesn’t tell us their stories – he explains them. Therefore the characters never became real to me – just their dialogue seemed surreal – and the narrative simply overwhelmed any and all of the underlying stories. Think of watching a movie sitting next to someone who has seen it before and feels the need to keep whispering in your ear - detailing plot twists and characters’ actions. At some point you simply want to yell, “Shut up!” . I had the same experience/frustration reading this book, hoping – in vain - that the author would remove himself from the narrative. I know I’m in the minority here – but pass on this one."
43,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18868296-albert,Rating 4 out of 5,"When I first began reading Let the Great World Spin I did not think it would rate very high for me. First, there was the style of writing. Early on the setting and scenes were described in short sentences, one after another in great repetition. It felt lazy. Choppy. I was thinking: is this the best he can do? Then there were the stories, because that is what they felt like, loosely connected. There was the event, the high wire walk by Philippe Petit on August 7, 1974 between the two towers of the World Trade Center, that was at the core and supposedly held it all together, but the connections often felt tenuous. I am one that likes this style of loosely connected stories or scenes, but in this case the connections felt too fragile. Then I began to understand, at least I felt I did, that there was something larger than the event, than the high wire walk, that held it all together. There was New York City and time and the inevitability of the energy and momentum of the city. I found I enjoyed the rich detail of the characters, of their lives. I saw how the interconnections between the characters were at points almost random or by chance. I found myself mesmerized by the structure of the novel. At first, it felt overly constructed, almost architected. However, the movement of the narrative back and forth in time and the switching between the different perspectives of characters created a flow that attracted me and pulled me in. The writing style, which I did not like at first, varies considerably throughout the novel, which felt like another structural element. I found the style much more to my liking throughout large sections of the novel and thought some of the insights and commentary on life to be striking. ""People think they know the mystery of living in your skin. They don’t. There’s no one knows except the person who carts it around her own self."" ""New York kept going forward precisely because it didn’t give a good goddamn about what it had left behind."" ""It had never occurred to me before but everything in New York is built upon another thing, nothing is entirely by itself, each thing as strange as the last, and connected."" As the novel came to an end, the experience over, I found almost as much enjoyment in pondering what I had read as I did in the reading. While I don’t think this novel is for everyone, I do recommend it."

Por un momento, cuando se disponía a dar un paso adelante, parecía que se iba a tirar al vacío, pero no era así: el hombre estaba caminando sobre un cable que unía las dos torres, a 110 pisos de altura, a 400 metros de altura. A esa distancia era como si estuviese volando. Hace poco he vuelto a ver la película documental 'Man on Wire', donde se cuenta con detalle cómo fue planificado el ""golpe"", y de nuevo me he emocionado. Ese hombre, con su pértiga, caminando, a veces corriendo, por la cuerda floja es increíble. Hay un momento en que incluso se tumba sobre el cable, ¿podéis imaginarlo?, y es de lágrimas en los ojos. Es escalofriante, sobrecogedor, hermoso, un poema viviente, y sólo podía suceder donde suele suceder todo: Nueva York.El nombre de este héroe es Philippe Petit.Pero la historia contada por Colum McCann en 'Que el vasto mundo siga girando', ganadora del National Book Award en 2009, entre otros premios, no trata sobre Petit y su hazaña. La historia y los protagonistas son otros, aunque Petit también aparece en ciertos momentos. McCann utiliza la hazaña de Petit como trasfondo para su novela. Realmente no hay un único protagonista en el libro, pues se trata de una novela coral. Me parece magnífico sobre todo cómo McCann hila las vivencias de los protagonistas, formando un collage en el que todo está conectado, y como si del funambulista se tratase, el lector, desde las alturas de Nueva York, entra en conocimiento de todo lo que les acontece.Los protagonistas y sus historias son varios. Estamos en 1974, un año importante para los americanos, cuando Nixon dimitió. En primer lugar tenemos a dos hermanos irlandeses, donde Ciaran visita a Corrigan. Desde siempre, éste ha intentado ayudar a los necesitados, y ahora pertenece a una orden que le ha destinado a Nueva York. Aquí Corrigan trata de ayudar en los posible a las prostitutas de su calle, aunque ello comporte cierto riesgo para él. Esta manera de vivir, casi en la pobreza y rodeado de peligro, no son para nada del gusto de su hermano Ciaran. Esta parte de la historia es francamente buena, porque se nos muestra, mediante los recuerdos de Ciaran, cómo era su vida anterior, así como también somos testigos del Nueva York más miserable.Otro personaje importante es Claire, una mujer rica cuya vida quedó destrozada al morir su único hijo en la guerra de Vietnam. En el momento de conocerla, se dispone a recibir a una amigas en su casa; se trata de un grupo de madres que tienen en común la pérdida de hijos en la guerra, y cuyas reuniones sirven como ayuda al compartir sus tragedias.Lara es otra protagonista de la novela con un papel fundamental. Es una mujer joven, pintora, y casada también con un artista, y ambos están sumergidos en un mundo de drogas. Hay más personajes de los cuáles iremos conociendo su papel en la historia: Gloria, una mujer negra perteneciente al grupo de Claire; el juez Solomon, marido de Claire; Tillie, una prostituta amiga de Corrigan; Fernando, fotógrafo aficionado; un grupo de hackers... Llega un momento en que es mejor no comentar nada más de los personajes, porque sus historias están conectadas y es mejor desentrañarlas por uno mismo.Colum McCann ha escrito una maravillosa novela, en la que sus personajes tienen vida propia, de manera que a su término no puedes evitar el sentir cierta tristeza, ya que no volverás a saber más de ellos. Como se dice en la novela:""No solemos saber qué es lo que oímos cuando oímos algo por primera vez, pero una cosa es cierta: lo oímos como jamás volveremos a oírlo. Supongo que regresamos al momento para experimentarlo, pero la verdad es que nunca podemos encontrarlo, sino sólo su recuerdo, la huella más tenue de lo que realmente fue, lo que significaba."""

E c'è anche qualcuno che tende un cavo tra le Torri Gemelle e le attraversa più volte, dimostrando che nonostante tutto si può sempre arrivare dall'altra parte del filo, sconfiggendo i propri problemi e il proprio destino.Tutti cercano amore, speranza e considerazione. La nostra vita è in continuo equilibrio tra aspetti positivi e negativi. Possiamo diventare migliori o peggiori di quello che siamo trovando le persone giuste o quelle sbagliate, trovando più o meno amore, più o meno considerazione. Non ci sono bravi e cattivi a prescindere. Ognuno di noi ha bisogno di qualcun altro che ci faccia capire qual è la strada giusta, di qualcuno che ci riporti in equilibrio.Ed è proprio la speranza ciò di cui hanno bisogno tutti i protagonisti, soffocati dalle paure; paura per la guerra in Vietnam, per il razzismo non risolto, per la povertà, paura di giudicare e di essere giudicato, di amare e di non essere ricambiati.McCann è bravissimo a creare momenti struggenti e poetici anche nei momenti più squallidi e a trasmetterci i sentimenti e le sensazioni dei protagonisti. Il romanzo è un insieme di voci che si intrecciano, di storie che sembrano separate ma che invece sono strettamente interconnesse, di stili diversi.“A Yale, quando era giovane e caparbio, era certo che un giorno sarebbe diventato il centro del mondo, che la sua vita avrebbe influenzato quella degli altri. Ma quell’età è quello che pensano tutti. L’egocentrismo è uno degli attributi della giovinezza. Lasciare il segno. Ma un adulto prima o poi impara. Ti scavi una piccola nicchia e ti ci annidi. E cavalchi la vita meglio che puoi. Vai a casa dalla tua dolce sposa e cerchi di calmarle i nervi. Ti metti seduto e le fai i complimenti per la posateria. Ringrazi la tua buona stella per l’eredità di tua moglie. Fumi un sigaro di qualità e speri in qualche capriola fra le lenzuola di seta. Le compri un bel gioiello da De Natale e la baci in ascensore perché è ancora bella e in forma, nonostante gli anni. Lo è davvero. La saluti con un bacio e vai a lavorare ogni giorno, e presto ti rendi conto che il tuo dolore non è più acuto di quello degli altri. Porti il lutto per la morte di tuo figlio e ti svegli nel cuore della notte con tua moglie che ti piange accanto e allora vai in cucina, tu prepari un sandwich col formaggio e pensi: Almeno è un sandwich al formaggio a Park Avenue, poteva andare peggio, saresti potuto cadere più in basso. E come ricompensa, un sospiro di sollievo.”Un libro bello, delicato, struggente, scritto veramente bene."

This event ripples out through many lives: an Irish priest falling in love for the first time, a woman whose only son has died in Vietnam, an arrested hooker, the woman who raises the hooker's grandchildren, and more. Each of them individual, each of them with their own voice and story, sometimes crossing over or else missing each other by minutes or years. And the writing? That's beautiful.

Навързват се някак си нещата - хората се срещат или пътищата им се пресичат, случките се преплитат. На моменти ми беше леко дразнещо, защото исках някои истории да са по-дълги за сметка на други и не чак толкова оплетени. Но в крайна сметка ми хареса как пише авторът. Градът, времето, културата, героите и съдбите им са уж далечни и чужди, а мислите и чувствата им - близки. От онези книги, които четеш и често си казваш - ""Да, така е, наистина е така"". Животът беше описан без пудра - любов, надежда, загуба, смърт, скръб. Понеже имаше много несправедливост и никаква компенсация за страданията и загубите, се сетих за Съмърсет Моъм и неговата книга ""Души в окови"". Там имаше нещо хубаво за смисъла на живота - да не го търсиш, защото такъв няма, а просто да живееш. Така е и тук - няма компенсация за тежката загубата, но пък можеш да прочетеш как хората се научават да живеят въпреки нея и с нея. Както се казва - никой не е обещавал, че ще ни е хубаво и лесно през цялото време, но пък от книгите се научаваш на много ""как"", когато е трудно и тежко. Дори само да разбереш, че просто може, пак е много. И още един любим автор ще перефразирам. Дъглас Кенеди казва, че четенето често е още един начин да разбереш, че не си сам, не си само ти. Не ми хареса обаче как свърши всичко в тази книга. Финалът куца. Сякаш изкуствен край. Сякаш докато е писал авторът, токът е спрял, а като са го пуснали, на него вече не му се е занимавало толкова. А на мен финалите са ми важни. Както и началата. Защото, все си мисля, че когато историите започват трябва да има обещание за надежда. А като свършват - надежда за друго начало - още по-хубаво. Така де - не може все да си казваш - ""И к'во от т'ва?"" "

The day is not an ordinary day, but rather the day which Philippe Petit walks a cable (walks, runs, hops, etc.) between the twin towers of the World Trade Center in NYC in the summer of 1974. While some of the characters in the story witness this act, it serves more as the common point for all.Seemingly random people who live rather ""ordinary"" lives, Corrigan, an Irish Jesuit priest, who chooses to live in a neighborhood filled with crime, hookers out of a desire to serve; Ciaran, his brother who has come to visit his brother; Tillie and Jazzlyn, mother and daughter prostitutes in Corrigan's neighborhood; Adelita, who is the woman Corrigan loves, but can't have; the women of the mother's support group who have lost sons in Vietnam, primarily Park Avenue Clair who bonds with less fortunate Gloria; Clare's husband Solomon, a judge; Blaine and Lara, artists whose lives are soon to take a turn from bad to worse. As Petit serves as the touchstone for the time and place, and as the story comes to a close the lives of these seemingly unrelated characters converge as in a dance, barely touching each other's lives, but leaving an unforgettable impact."
50,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/137273-eh-eh,Rating 4 out of 5,"At first I didn't really like this. It fell into the same category as the movie Crash which spawned a bunch of copycats, a disparate group of people somehow tied together by some event. I did like Crash, which was the first of that sort of movies I'd seen, but every other one seemed too derivative; it's an idea that's only fresh once. Also, this is by an Irish author and opens in Ireland, but while reading this my interest in all things Irish took a nosedive so I was set to be negative towards it.But after the initial pages, the stories moved over to New York City and it became almost a love letter to that location. Some of the paragraphs had a strange rhythm, a bunch of fragments like following a twisting vein of some kind of mined ore. The author's afterward stated something about trying to capture a texture and I think that's the right word for it, texture, the bumps and grooved surface of New York City.As far as novels go, there wasn't too much that happened. Some action, but not improbable or explosive. There is tragedy and injustice, but what struck me was the sense of these people living their days. I think I like that sense because it gives me the tentative thought that maybe someone will look upon my own unremarkable life with such tenderness. Probably not, but it's nice to think so."

Aș fi zis că povestea lui Philippe Petit a fost deja epuizată, la nivel informațional în documentar, iar la nivel artistic în filmul de mai târziu, acolo unde însuși funambulul îl mentorează pe actorul principal. Ce-i mai rămâne literaturii? ai fi tentat să te întrebi. Colum McCann știe însă că literatura n-are marginile rigide, că ea se poate reinventa interferând cu alte domenii, că poate ajunge în cele mai obscure locuri și da glas celor mai neinsemnate personaje, că poate reinvia/reconstrui ceva - in cazul de față cele două turnuri gemene.Traversarea acelei frânghii e doar un pretext de conectare a unor destine individuale si de ridicare a unei priviri colective spre cer. Punctul negru care se deplaseaza sporește constiinta propriei micimi, dar in acelasi timp ofera sperantă, tocmai ceea ce le lipseste multora dintre personaje.

I felt drawn into the story of brothers from Ireland, Corrie and Ciaran. Corrie is a priest living in proximity to a group of prostitutes and drug addicts. Ciaran arrives later and cannot quite approve of how Corrie is living. After a promising start, it becomes a loosely connected series of short stories, some of which appealed to me while others decidedly did not. The wire walker is not the main focus of this book. He serves more as a symbolic figure. Just as I was getting interested in one storyline, it abruptly shifts to something completely different. One of the characters I cared about disappears early on. There are lots of coincidences. The further I got into the book, the less I enjoyed it. I much preferred and recommend McCann’s Apeirogon and Dancer."

Yet I find myself just feeling a bit ""meh"" about the whole thing. The most fascinating part is at the center of the novel which talks about Philippe Petit's 1974 high wire walk between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Centre in New York City. Although I finished the novel last night, I wanted to reflect on it a bit more before reviewing. Coined as a 9/11 novel, I felt that it was actually quite scattered story wise and that perhaps the mere setting of the book is what received the original glowing reviews during its publication.

They will shatter and deconstruct. Spin. But they spin back.McCann's introductory five pages, as good as any beginning I've read, introduces his theme. A tightrope walker stands poised to cross between the World Trade Center Towers. It is 1974. A moment in time. We could dip our hand in Siddhartha's river. Or take a picture. McCann uses one. Philippe Petit on that fateful day, his balancing beam up and down, cross-secting the wire, a plane eerily above and between the Towers, presaging another historic moment. This is a book about intersections. People with each other and with time. And in this wonderful introduction, people look up, look out. At that moment, the walker intersects with them, people still not sure what they're seeing. Do it, asshole. Don't do it. At that moment, something falls down. Some body? The body twirled and caught and flipped, thrown about by the wind. No. A sweatshirt, fluttering. And then the man takes his first step out.Those first notes, the looking up, the looking down, the falling, fluttering, spinning, the reach for balance will all be repeated, connecting the movements that follow, each movement an interconnecting character.Things fall: a departed father's monthly check; a boy's blanket from a top bunk, meant to replace one given to a homeless drunk; a soldier in a helicopter. Old domino players sat in the courtyard, playing underneath the falling litter.People work: a chef who can ""pull a trumpet line out of a string of spaghetti""; an elevator operator who aligns the elevator and the floor perfectly and ""slides his foot out to test his workmanship.""Things spin: break dancers; a grieving mother's memories of her son; a car and a van.Always the interconnecting notes: a woman of two shoes who ""knew the floor very well""; another who ""followed a straight line""; a doubt of God, when ""you can't hold on""; a child running, one foot on the pavement, another on the road; a woman, descended from it all, who likes ""people who unbalance me.""Things bounce off each other: ""all sorts of lies were flying through the air, going back and forth, colliding with each other""; that car and van again, that ""was just a tap.""We didn't know you lived up there.History repeats and intersects. This is a book about 9/11, although that is never mentioned. It lets us look back as well, to the racism which runs like an artery through this country. A boy who was no more than eight played the saxophone, beautifully, like some strange drummer boy from the Civil War.I loved this book, the message, the artistry. Please read it. And if you do, please listen to the notes."

مردی روی سیموقتی در صبحگاه 7 آگوست 1974، فیلیپ پتی بین دو آسمانخراش مرکز تجارت جهانی به بندبازی در ارتفاع 400 متری پرداخت هیچ فکرش را نمیکرد سالها بعد نویسنده‌ای موضوع اصلی کتابش را بر اساس این رویداد قرار دهد. فیلیپ پتی بر بالای برجهای دوقلو اثری هنری را ثبت کرد که شاید تصورش را هم نمیکرد در 11 سپتامبر 2001، توسط پرواز های 11 و 175 هواپیمایی آمریکن ایرلاینز و یونایتد ایرلاینز طوری بازنویسی و دوباره خلق شود که بعد از آن دیگر ردی و نشانی هم از برجها باقی نماند.نویسنده قصد دارد بوسیله‌ی این اتفاق (بندبازی مردی بین برج‌های دوقولو) چند زندگی را به نوعی به هم مرتبط کند. زندگی‌هایی که هر یک به نوعی با چالشی روبروست. یک کشیش ایرلندی غیر رسمی که نگرانی‌های بشردوستانه‌اش گاه به مرز اغراق می‌رسد. زندگی زنی متمول که تنها فرزندش را در جنگ ویتنام از دست داده و نیاز به حضور در جمع و گفتگو در مورد فرزندش را دارد. روسپیان هروئینی محله‌های بزه خیز نیویورک. زنی رنگین پوست که همسر و فرزندانش را از دست داده و می‌خواهد مستقل باشد. و چند خرده روایت دیگر. طی چند فصل این شخصیت‌ها به تفصیل معرفی می‌شوند.در ادامه و با پیشرفت جریان داستان ارتباطی بین این شخصیت‌ها و زندگی‌هاشان شکل می‌گیرد. اتفاقات و رویدادهای داستان مانند بندبازی است که بین شخصیت‌ها را بند کشیده و به هم مرتبط کرده و روی آن گاه می‌جهد و گاه می‌خزد و زمانی می‌خوابد. رمان «بگذار دنیای بزرگ بچرخد» داستان گذرا بودن زندگی‌ها و رویدادهایش هم هست. زندگی شخصیت‌هایش را در گرداب حوادث به تصویر می‌کشد و اینکه بعدها چگونه فراموش می‌کنیم زمانی مردی در ارتفاع 400 متری بین دو برج هنر نمایی کرده است و خود یک اثر هنری را بوجود آورده.چگونه در جریان پیشرفت کتاب و داستانِ شخصیت‌ها از اهمیت مردِ بندباز کاسته می‌شود و بعد، سال‌ها می‌گذرد و دنیای بزرگ می‌چرخد و راهش را باز می‌کند و حتا برج‌های تجارت جهانی فرو می‌ریزند و نشانه ها حذف می‌شوند. گویا پیامی از طرف کائنات به گوش می‌رسد که: اگر مصیبتی و موهبتی داری، اگر بالا و پایینی از سر گذرانده ای، اگر دنیا بهتان سخت گرفته، اگر و اگر و اگر، تنها بگذار دنیای بزرگ بچرخد. همه چیز به مرور محو می‌شود.ا [زکی! آری شود ولی به خون جگر شود. ;-) ]اروایت ها گاه جذاب می‌شوند و گاه حوصله سر بر. پیکره تراشیقلم کالم مککن شخصیت محور است. آنچنان که به شرح و توصیف شخصیت‌هایش می‌پرازد به نشانه‌های بیرونی علاقه نشان نمی‌دهد. همین موضوع ممکن است برای برخی خوانندگان که بیشتر به دنبال نشانه‌های بصری و عینی باشند خسته کننده شود. در این کتاب هم حجم عمده‌ای از کتاب به شرح تصورات و خیالات و برداشت‌های درونی شخصیت می‌پردازد. در مقایسه با نویسندگانی که اجازه می‌دهند کوران حوادث داستانی موجودیت شخصیت‌هایشان را شکل بدهد، کالم مککن به صورت مستقیم و با قلمی تیز پیکره‌ی شخصیت‌ها را می‌تراشد. البته که توصیف شخصیت به صورت مستقیم سلیقه‌ی من نیست و همین کمی از ملاحت کتاب کاست.ممنون خانم مترجمترجمه‌ی این اثر به نظرم کار مشکلی بوده است که همین باعث شده گاهی مترجم گیج ترجمه کرده و نامفهوم جملات را از سر باز کرده باشد اما عموما نمره‌ی قابل قبولی می‌گیرد. کما اینکه چندان ترجمه‌ی درخشانی نیست. به نظرم بازار نشر نیاز به معرفی نویسندگان جدید دارد. نویسندگانی که بتوانند شانسشان را در بازار نشر و کتاب ایران امتحان کنند و از این لحاظ خانم زهرا حسینیان لطف بزرگی کرده اند که آثار ایشی گورو و کوئلو و موراکامی و .... را برای مرتبه ی هزارم ترجمه نکرده اند.پینوشت: 1- مجموعه داستانی از این نویسنده به نام دیدن از سیزده منظر قبلا ترجمه شده است و خواندنی.2- مستند مردی روی سیم، در سال 2008 به بند باز اشاره شده در این کتاب پرداخته. به صورت اتفاقی نویسنده سال بعد (2009) این کتاب را منتشر کرده! از ستاره‌هاش کم می‌کنم.3- اگر ارزشی محسوب شود که نمی‌شود، من اولین فارسی زبانی بودم که برای این کتاب مرور نوشت."

I cannot write this review sans hyperbole. Why? Because the meaning(s) of this novel expands: the more you meditate on it, the more boundless in its connections and scope. However, the fundamental theme is illuminated by the author through the character of Gloria on pp 306 of the ARC:""...everything in New York is built upon another thing, nothing is entirely by itself, each thing as strange as the last, and connected.""Although New York City 1974 is McCann's vital, breathing subject, you can love this story without ever having visited the city. You have surely lodged with the savage nobility of the human spirit--the exquisite pain and extraordinary beauty of the soul; degenerate misery; wild exultation; unutterable grief; merciful exaltation; boneless survival. All this manifests and more as a crescendo of disparate voices intersect, climb and caterwaul to a swirling catharsis.Above, at 110 stories, in artful equipoise, funambulist Philippe Petit performs on a high wire between the North and South Twin Towers, captivating a swell of onlookers on the ground below. With his ballet shoes and 55-lb. balancing pole, he leaps, dances, lays down, salutes, converses with a circling gull, and makes eight crossings between the two towers. Strange, dangerous, impossible, realized.The book favors theme and character development over plot, and yet the pages turn with as much tension as a gripping thriller. It is a high-wire act both literally and metaphorically. McCann's mega-watt prose is ripe with paradox and parabola, like this story. The highborn; hopeless; corrupt; wretched; and the darlings intersect and reveal a common core.There is momentum, then a staggering halt--and, in the end, the great world spins.A+ "

E sì, funamboli.Persone in maggioranza degnissime, che fanno lavori degnissimi, per carità.Ma io mi vedo benissimo in una scena di un film di Woody Allen (non uno dei suoi migliori, non ricordo quale), in cui lui, parlando con Diane Keaton, le mostra un deficiente con la faccia dipinta di bianco e con addosso un lenzuolo, in piedi su un piedistallo ed immobilizzato in un gesto idiota, e le dice ""io odio i mimi"".Anch'io.Ma non solo i mimi, anche i pagliacci, i prestigiatori e tutti gli altri.Quindi io, nonostante New York, ho fatto fatica a godermi questo libro.E' scritto bene ed è originale e tutto, ma ogni due pagine sbuca fuori questo imbecille che un giorno, non sapendo cos'altro fare, ha tirato un cavo fra le torri gemelle (a un certo punto si cerca anche di spiegare come diavolo ha fatto, ma quando ho letto che nella storia c'entrano un arco e le frecce ho smesso di cercare di capire) e poi ci ha camminato sopra. Detestabile sfoggio di arroganza e di coraggio fine a se stesso.Le storie di varie persone che vivono quella stessa giornata, incontrandosi per caso o no, non sono male. Mi sono piaciute molto le madri dei ragazzi morti in Vietnam, con cui è facile empatizzare anche se non riesco ad immaginare come possa, una donna che ha perso un figlio in guerra, desiderare di incontrare altre madri che hanno subito a stessa perdita per parlarne insieme; mi è piaciuto meno il monaco e la corte dei miracoli in cui si è calato, ancora meno la storiella del ragazzino che tagga i tunnel della metro, e la telefonata dalla California ad un interlocutore casuale ai piedi delle torri gemelle.Alla fine, è un libro discreto (non c'è dubbio che sia scritto bene e che l'idea sia originale), ma merita di essere letto da qualcuno che non ce l'ha con i mimi ed i funamboli."

Trái đất vẫn cứ quay (như trong ""Let the Great World Spin""), thời gian vẫn cứ trôi (như trong ""A Visit from the Goon Squad""), con người gặp gỡ rồi chia lìa, những giấc mơ được tạo nên rồi tan vỡ, những tình yêu hình thành rồi dần phai nhạt.

62,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3131331-john,Rating 5 out of 5,I’ve found an author that I love. Each chapter seemed like a short story that had little if anything to do with the previous chapters. But they come together to make a wonderful whole. I’ll be reading more from my new friend. 
63,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2361952-biblibio,Rating 3 out of 5,"The thing about ""Let the Great World Spin"" is that I liked it. Quite a bit, in fact. I enjoyed reading it, was pulled into the story, and even though the book had a few glaring flaws, I ultimately was glad to have read it. So why merely an ""I liked it"" rating? In the end, the issues bother more than one might expect.The main problem ""Let the Great World Spin"" has is too many story threads. Here is a book titled ""a novel"", but it's far more similar to a collection of short stories. The only difference is that the short stories begin to connect as the reader progresses in the book and center around one single event. This is certainly a clever and pleasant way to build a story, and in most senses it works. The progression is smooth and the way the story fits together and expands is intriguing and well-done. Colum McCann even succeeds at making each brief encounter with the characters meaningful and complete, giving us a number of well-crafted characters for short bursts of time.But it's too much. Too many characters, too many plot threads, and the drama at times felt forced on. Not glaringly so, but there were moments where the story rang a little false, momentarily displacing the reader. McCann's writing is technically excellent (a big bonus) and the flow to the story is great, but it was hard to leave the book without feeling a little manipulated and cheated (the ending is particularly jarring - I still haven't figured out why the last chapter exists...).""Let the Great World Spin"" is a good book, make no mistake. It probably deserves something like a 3.5 rating (for those keeping count), something less than truly great but better than simply okay. I enjoyed reading it and will most likely return to it someday. But I think it also depends on who the reader is and what he/she expects. As a collection of short stories built around a central event, it succeeds magnificently in terms of structure, and is lacking in conciseness. As a novel, it's a bit all over the place and could have been a little tighter. Even so, the characters and connected stories will be enough to draw in many readers and I ultimately think it's quite worth the read.Warmly recommended."

Sebbene le storie che McCann racconta sembrino inizialmente slegate, andando avanti con la lettura si capisce che quelli che potrebbero essere racconti a sé stanti, con personaggi diversi, sono tutti collegati dal camminare sul filo: ognuno di loro -il monaco di strada Corrigan, la prostituta di colore Tillie, la ricca e bianca Claire che vive in un bell’appartamento in Park Avenue e l’amica di colore Gloria che vive nel Bronx, la pittrice Lara rinchiusa in un matrimonio di cui non è mai stata convinta- cammina su un filo esile, perdendo l’equilibrio a tratti ma sempre in ballo, va avanti con cautela, un passo dietro l’altro, titubante eppure sicuro, accarezzato dal vento dell’esistenza che potrebbe scaraventarlo a terra, fargli fare un volo mortale, se volesse. Ognuno rischia il tutto per tutto, il pericolo è assoluto, non c’è scampo se si sbaglia: o il dolore o l’amore, non c’è alternativa. Eppure ognuno cammina con leggerezza e con delicatezza, e soprattutto i personaggi femminili sono descritti con profonda empatia, su tutti Tillie, una prostituta di colore che, nel bellissimo capitolo intitolato Nella casa di Biancaneve, commuove il lettore per la sensibilità e l’amore che la guidano ma anche la disperazione profonda che la porta ad una decisione irrevocabile. Sullo sfondo c’è New York, città amata, città funambolica anch’essa, che fa girare la testa, come il pensiero di quel funambolo lassù, a 100 metri d’altezza, ha fatto girare la testa a me, che soffro di vertigini, mentre leggevo.Non ho dato 5 stelle perché alcuni capitoli mi sono piaciuti di meno, come quelli intitolati Tag e Rete occidentale, ed anche perché la frammentarietà delle storie, che ne costituisce il valore, è anche un limite che a volte durante la lettura si fa forte, costringendo lo scrittore a tornare spesso indietro all’episodio centrale del romanzo."
65,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1421407-janet,Rating 5 out of 5,"Great writing, but as usual, I was thrown when the point of view shifted after 70 pages, and from a very specific and very highly textured couple of Irish brothers and an intriguing problem on the physical and spiritual level to someone I couldn't have cared less about--alas, I am someone who hates to buy into a point of view and be allowed to sink into it only to have it jerked away from me. I had similar issues with Cloud Atlas which I may go back and try again. Luckily, this book begins to make itself known rather more quickly, as additional sections loop back around to that first fascinating one, and gently use as the spine--or tightrope cable-- the legendary walk of aerialist Philippe Petit between the Twin Towers in 1974. Wonder if the book will take this all way the to 9/11. We'll see...*****************About two thirds the way through this now. The successive points of view knit and knit back again, and McCann's keenness of ear for the nuances of speech creates character as sound. The voice of Tilly Henderson, the Bronx prostitute is especially remarkable. This is certainly bravura writing, and once I got over my attachment to the first voice, and the two Irish brothers, and allowed myself to ride the currents between all these characters, the lay brother and his faith, the Park Avenue mother with the dead soldier son, the Bronx prostitute with her prostitute daughter, the guilty hipster artist and her self-aggrandizing boyfriend, the judge, and dazzling them all, up on a slender wire, the walker. The whole thing a highwire act.******************A dazzling book, the delights of which center around the bravura of the writing, all those voices, and all the surprises as McCann manages to lace one story through the next. The very ending was not as as resonant as I might have hoped, but by the nature of the structure of the book, divided among all these characters, it's very difficult to provide the kind of emotional satisfaction that involvement with a single character does. But the pleasures of this book are myriad, the writing of the highest caliber. I'm not surprised it won the National Book Award."
66,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4579103-dely,Rating 2 out of 5,"This book didn't work for me and it wasn't able to talk to me. I was not emotionally involved and all the characters felt ""cold""; above all I didn't feel them as real and realistic. They were one-dimensional and created by the author only to communicate his message: though life can be tough and difficult, there will always be unexpected love that helps to go on. No, I'm sorry, but life doesn't work this way.Also, some events are too unreal, for example that kind of friar that falls in love and makes love with a woman, his brother that felt in love with an accomplice of the accident where the friar dies, Gloria that is able to adopt the two little children of Jazzlyn though being a divorced middle age woman, etc.. What I also didn't like was the author starting a new chapter without introducing the new characters, and then the reader had to find out about whom he was talking and how these characters were connected to each other. The stories are all intertwined and the characters' lives meet, though sometimes only for a short moment, and I had the feeling that the author wanted to add a kind of suspense so that the reader could feel happy once recognized the characters. I don't like this, I want to know about whom I'm reading. I don't feel happy or smart recognizing characters who aren't introduced as they should. This makes me only angry.I also didn't like the writing style. 2 stars only because I managed to finish the book."
67,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3263980-adam-dalva,Rating 3 out of 5,"There's a lot to like about this book and I love it for its earnestness, but it has the problem that novels like this (many supporting characters each get their own chapter in rotation around a molten core of drama that we never quite get to) often have: The coincidences stack, and the returns diminish. By Part 2, when it became clear that we would always be on the periphery, momentum was lost. Savage Detectives really pulled this sort of structure off, but here it became predictable.L.T.G.W.S. also goes beyond good direct sentiment and approaches cliche a bit too often - some sequences are fairly painful, and some characters are too broadly drawn, are in the book to either draw sympathy or illustrate part of the tableau that C. McC. is trying to lay out. And one coincidence, in particular, is groan-worthy. All that said, this is a good New York book - Philippe Petit is a source of personal fascination and it was a pleasure whenever we landed in his head. And Corrigan, for all his Angel-in-the-housedness, is a strong central figure. I'm not surprised to see a swath of ratings: lots of 2s, lots of 5s. For me, in the end, it came out to somewhere like a bit above average, but individual results will vary."

This terrible (and terribly overhyped) book is as dull, obvious, and subtle as a lead pipe to the head. A monkey typing out the screenplay of ""Crash"" would end up with a better story. A monkey watching ""Jersey Shore"" would come away with a more nuanced reading of New York than you will reading this book. Heck, a monkey watching John Mayer sing ""Chocolatte Rain"" on YouTube would have more to say about race than this piously classist waste of paper does. I'm not even sure what that last thing means now that I read over it but I can promise you it's more exciting than anything in this book. Listen, America, Brooklyn hipsterati white boys will never write a great, or even good, New York novel, no matter what they or their publicists tell you.

69,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4125128-steve,Rating 1 out of 5,"Let The Great World Spin by Colum McCann seems to me to be a greatly overrated novel, if that is what it is.McCann uses Philippe Petit's high-wire walk across a cable between the twin towers during their construction as organizing event for a series of episodes that I guess McCann thought would tie the novel together. McCann appears to see Petit's feat as a theme. It was a remarkable display of nerve, skill and Petit’s courage and ability to focus--an impressive array of traits. If there is a significance in this that is supposed to extend to his characters we would have to see it in them, somehow, wouldn’t we, but they seem oddly one dimensional and ordinary to me, some brought up briefly, then dropped, as the guy who hit the priest’s car, talks himself out of any responsibility for the accident, and then-–poof--he’s gone from the story. There are other examples of characters that appear briefly but don't seem to have any function in this story. They are there one page and gone the next.Much of the action takes place in the south Bronx, a virtual war zone in the 1970's. So many of the people living there were reduced to being outlaws--prostitutes here-–if they wanted to stay alive. Moving among them, a main character, is a good-hearted member of a Catholic religious order who is there for them, supplying a safe house and haven for a few of them in their dangerous lives. That is all to the good though there is something too bland about him that prevents him from being more interesting. He means well, I guess. Though it would be easy to do, I don't think McCann intends to satirize his role of the religious man trying to make a difference in a brutal environment although it's easy to get political about this character. His institution, the Catholic church, is part of the problem. It accepts our ""fallen"" nature as normal. That's part of their basic doctrine. William Blake tells us, in a paraphrase, ""and Misery's increase/ Is Mercy, Pity, Peace."" We don't need the virtues without the context of misery. Sadly, instead of trying to get rid of misery we think it's sufficient to comfort people, or be nice or to try to help. The priest is an agent for good in an evil world but it's an ineffectual agency. Also, McCann spends too much time over the priest's agonizing about whether or not to have sex with his woman friend. We would expect him to display at least one or two of Petit's virtues, but no, he doesn't. And McCann really shouldn't try to talk like black people. He has an average ear at best. That kind of zesty, irreverent, clever, jive talk is hard to replicate. I don’t think he does it well enough. But it’s McCann's own voice that really gets me. I have a few examples of his vague and aphoristic style from a book that is crammed with them. He makes statements like, “If you think you know all the secrets, you think you know all the cures.” Please, what does that mean? If you are a generous reader you will find yourself saying, well what he means is.... and then you will supply your own interpretation. But it seems to me it’s the author who is supposed to do that. He wants us to supply his meaning for him. He keeps tossing the ball back to the reader. Here, you make sense of this.Another: “So much of it was about the old cure of forgetting. To become anonymous to himself, have his own body absorb him. And yet, there were overlapping realities: he also wanted his mind to be in that place where his body was at ease.” What does the “it” refer to? Is forgetting a cure? For what? To become anonymous to himself... is that possible? He knows who he is. Have his own body absorb him? What does that mean? And he follows that up with “and yet...” but he hasn’t said anything specific enough for a phrase like “and yet” to get us ready for the conclusory thought he is about to thrust at us. What is that thought? That there are “overlapping realities(plural)–the desire to be where his body was at ease (singular). What realities? Where? Overlapping? What the heck is this supposed to mean? It takes nerve to be this vague and it happens over and over.How about “It was so much like having sex with the wind.” Not just “like” but “so much like.” So there is a shade of meaning here he wants to call our attention to. And “having sex with the wind?” Really? What is that like? What about wind chill?Another one: “A grave does not equal what we have had in our lifetime.” What does that mean? Does it make sense as an observation? Not to me. To me, it's ridiculousness uttered with a straight face. Why does he expect people to read this and then puzzle out what it probably “means?”“Goodness was more difficult than evil. Evil men knew that more than good men. That’s why they became evil.” Come one. This is a silly, empty statement, pretentiousness stretched to the absurd. About New York he says, “Things happened because it was a city uninterested in history...Strange things (!) occurred precisely because there was no necessary regard for the past.” This is nonsense. A city is not an entity that is “interested” in anything. Strange things (what things?) occurred “precisely"" because there is no “necessary” regard for the past. “Precisely” and “necessary” being words intended to alert us to what McCann appears to regard as a trenchant view, though the view itself is obscure. What is he talking about?It seems to me that readers have the right to assume that the author has something specific in mind. His sentences have the obligation to convey at least one meaning on the surface, and maybe a figurative one as well if that is the writer’s intent. But too many of McCann's sentences fail this basic test. Too many of them convey nothing unless and until the generous reader steps in and supplies the meaning it was the author’s task to provide. It’s not all bad. But there is too much baloney to make up for some of the things he did passably well. I mean, this guy got the National Book Award for this. I’m still scratching my head on that one. This book, to me, is an example of the novelist as con man, and this from an academic. I think McCann is worse than Richard Ford who pulls this kind of stuff, too.Even the title is pretentious, as if he is saying we must take our world as it is with all its tragedy. It appears to accept life as we know it now with no anger at our lost and wasted potential. It's passive, in line with what I suspect is McCann's Catholic, stoic view. We sinned. This is the result. So back to Petit for a moment. Do any of the characters in this book display any of the qualities that Petit displayed? I didn't think so. Is that the point? That our modern culture is so corrupted that we need feats like Petit's to remind us of them? I don't think that either. Well then maybe McCann is a fatalist and embraces our fallen world. A lot of us don't and want to see it improved. In this respect it is a very conservative book, aside from being a very muddled one. We can't really tell what McCann thinks. But a novelist is supposed to have a point of view that he uses his art to express. McCann doesn't. He won't tell us what he thinks. One reviewer was upset because it did not make the list for consideration by the Booker Prize committee but I can see why. I would be upset if it had. "

It also presents a picture of NYC in the early 1970s, shortly after Vietnam and when crime and poverty were high in the city.

McCann has covered all the elements in this story: engaging characters, poetic prose - but not over the top. His setting of 1970's New York was spot on. And I didn't want to put it down. All of this makes it a true 5 star novel.Just one point - not necessarily negative, but important to mention. It reads like a collection of short stories with different characters connected to others. That's what I loved and what I thought was not only clever, but difficult to do. HOWEVER, if you do NOT like the short story format, you may not like this book, even with its high rating. Additional note: Netflix ""Man on Wire"" before you read it. Interesting documentary of Philippe Petit who walked a tightrope across the World Trade Centers in 1974.

It’s a busy morning, as all mornings are in the busiest city in the world, and people know (New Yorkers have that unique sixth sense), that this will be the talk of town later, making the headlines in The New York Post and The Daily News. Opening just as Tony Morrison’s Song of Solomon, Let the great world spin gravitates around a man walking a tightrope wire between the World Trade Center towers in August 1974. And it is just as if that wire could form a circle inclosing the various characters that come and go in this fascinating story as the Vietnam War is taking a wrong turn, Watergate heads toward its infamous conclusion, and Richard Nixon resigns in a televised address from the Oval Office. A young Irish priest has ended up preaching somewhere in the Bronx where his followers are hookers and junkies; his brother has come to stay with him not knowing what to make of the night visitors; Gloria and her friends come to visit Claire at her penthouse on Park Avenue, a solemn occasion to remember their children (they are all mothers of lost soldiers in Vietnam) that somehow takes an unexpected turn; Judge Soderberg is taking over a particular case that did indeed make the news, in the downtown court he solemnly presides; and on the FDR, a car hits a van that crashes, while the driver, a psychedelic artist high on dope and his girlfriend, leave the crime scene, two runaways consumed by guilt. Colum McCann is in excellent form throughout as he intertwines the stories that at first sight seem to be totally unrelated, with a vigorous prose style, rich and thick at times, that beautifully paints each of the chapters and characters that make this colorful novel._"

But why be stingy? They're only stars. And I know how hard bringing a book to fruition is, how because there are so many books piling up in our lives and ever more hurtling toward us year after year, we take for granted that each author generally intends to make art. If I conclude that a book rises to the level of art on some level, and that I'm somehow affected by it, that I'm certain it will stick with me in a big or small way, that I was made to feel, then it becomes a four-star winner. A three says I read it, it was okay, it rose to the middle. And a five is a four with an exclamation point, one of the worst and most overused marks in language.Let the Great World Spin has scope, good writing, insight, and evokes empathy. There were days where I was tired, wanted the book to end somewhere in the middle. Then a new section would open up and I could tie narrative threads together, and in the end, the sum of all the parts, those voices and unexpected turns, the little acrobatic flourishes of writing that brought danger and passion alive, well, they kept me going to the end. My freewheeling star system has consistency, even if, in the end, they're only stars."

However, this book was constantly telling me how to feel: feel sorry for the mother who lost her son in Vietnam, feel sorry for the prostitutes in the Bronx, feel your own racial sterotypes and perceptions begin to change. Although it was well written, it was too on-the-nose in its intent. McCann was purposefully attempting the type of post-modern novel that critics and book clubs will fawn over and did not, in my opinion, do it successfully.Don't get me wrong, I love pretension. I'm one of the most pretentious people you'll meet, but this was merely pretension for pretension's sake. Being obtuse for the sake of being obtuse, being existensial on purpose, which is the complete antithesis of existentialism.The New York Times called it the literary version of the film ""Crash,"" which I also hated for the same reasons. Just as a few years ago, when I attempted to read ""A Million Little Pieces"" and decided I was over the memoir genre, now I'm over the whole ""convoluded story arcs that all connect whether important to the story line or not"" genre.

The final nail in the coffin was a reference to a mail carrier lost during Hurricane Katrina because he was so conscientious: ""...I found the sack of mail floating...I found out two weeks later that he was caught up high in a treetop just rotting in the heat. In his mailman uniform...I still got his mail here, see?"" Mr. McCann, I left New Orleans myself on early Sunday, along with most of the population. The storm came in on Monday by which time you may be assured that there was no mail to be distributed. Nobody was out in his mailman uniform with a sack of mail to lose in the flood. With all that happened in those days, why did you choose to make up something that wouldn't have - couldn't have - happened?The poetry of some writing in the book is compelling, and the imagery occasionally breathtaking, but these errors kept pulling me up short. More careful research and/or editing might have avoided that."

However, it was interesting in all the wrong places. The author wrote his best lines on the absolutely trivial, failing to correlate long story arcs that only obliquely connected. I guess one could say that making the trivial beautiful is a skill, but in this case it worked only partially, at the expense of the main story.Having a comfortable knowledge of New York City really helps one's understanding of the text, as addresses and landmarks are consistently used for reference."

[...] Avanziamo incespicando, portiamo un po' di rumore nel silenzio, troviamo in altri di che andare avanti. E' quasi abbastanza. Colum McCann mi ha fatto sentire a casa. La casa: quel posto in cui puoi rifugiarti, rinchiuderti a rinnegare il mondo intero e un attimo dopo progettare nuovi piani di conquista dell'esterno. Il posto in cui trovi una coperta di affetto confortante, certo, ma anche stilettate pronte a trapassarti da parte a parte, nei tuoi punti più sensibili. Stilettate necessarie o meno, ma presenti. McCann fa esattamente lo stesso effetto di una madre affettuosa coi piedi per terra. Ti mostra un oggetto che vortica in aria grazie al soffio del vento, ti dice: ""Vedi, che bello! Questa è l'armonia di cui a volte è capace il vento"". Poi, ti fa notare che quello che vortica in aria è un sacco di plastica abbandonato tra il lerciume del Bronx, tra siringhe insanguinate e futuri interrotti, e che il vento può perdere tutta la sua poesia quando inizia a fregiarsi con nomi di donna come Katrina.Mi sono sentita a casa perché il racconto si basa su un fatto realmente accaduto e che mi ha colpita qualche mese fa grazie a un documentario: la traversata dello spazio tra le torri gemelle da parte di un funambolo francese, Philippe Petit. Piccolo di nome e di fatto, viso comune, sguardo arzillo, sorriso giocoso, voglia di essere (e non di vivere, perché questo può riuscire anche senza averne voglia, sepolti nell'apatia). McCann ha preso la voglia di essere di quest'uomo, ha puntato il dito verso la sua impresa più strabiliante, un uomo che passeggia a 110 piani di altezza e fa pure il teatrante salutando le folle e facendo inchini. Che bello, pazzesco, fenomenale, cazzo. Come le persone stipate nelle strade di New York col naso per aria, tanto stipate che persino le strade non bastavano più per racchiuderle, ti ritrovi lì col cuore in mano a Petit, con il piede nel suo piede, passo dopo passo, sul filo. Provi l'ebrezza dell'altitudine, il solleticare del vento che ti passa vicino senza farti cadere - finalmente, finalmente - e poi McCann ti butta giù. Come la busta che cade volteggiando, ti scaraventa tra il pubblico, inchiodandoti alle loro vite. E ti ritrovi con un piede sul filo e l'altro al piano terra del World Trade Center.Mi sono sentita a casa perché la prosa di McCann è meditata ma mai artificiale, ponderata ma mai alleggerita o appesantita da inutili code o tacchi alti per far sembrare magnificente quello che non lo è. Perché con frasi come ""cenere e polvere e luce scacciano l'oscurità dalle cose"" è capace di mischiare tutto, bene, male e incertezza, e di farne un cocktail che ha il sentore della vita che vedi scorrerti ogni giorno davanti. Mi sono sentita a casa anche perché questo libro mi è stato regalato da una persona speciale, e nel leggere i passi che l'hanno emozionata sentivo sovrapporsi la mia voce e la sua, sul timbro di McCann. Sarà melenso, forse, ma così è stato per me: bello e umano come una chiacchierata liberatoria."

The story is based on the lives of eleven characters on the day in 1974 when French funambulist, Philippe Petit, danced across a wire (tightrope) secured between the new twin towers at the World Trade Center in New York. It is a well-written, literary masterpiece with highly believable, three-dimensional (complicated) characters. The characters are extremely diverse, and include an Irish immigrant “monk” with a heart of gold, a Park Avenue wife of a judge/mother of a son who was killed in Vietnam, a Guatemalan nurse, a young artist trying to kick a cocaine habit and living a 1920s lifestyle, a heroin-addicted street-walking prostitute and her daughter and two young children. There is also a chapter where seemingly unrelated characters in Palo Alto, CA—a group of pioneering computer hackers—find a way to contact payphones in Manhattan on the day of Petit’s performance, and try to get a live blow-by-blow account of the event from eye-witnesses. It’s a reminder to the reader of the state of technology at the time, and how different the world of 1974 was from today, when the event, no doubt, would have been broadcast on every television station and the Internet.This prompted our group to discuss our own “day-in-the-life” experiences we had on Sept. 11, when we first heard of the attacks on the twin towers. Not surprisingly, everyone in the room watched the horrendous events unfold on television.The high wire event loosely connects all the characters and it feels as though the lives are spinning and folding atop one another in unexpected ways. In spite of the darkness and at times, overwhelming grief associated with these character’s lives, the reader is left satisfied and reminded how different (and important) each life and each character’s personal story is.I give this book my highest recommendation."

It's a beautifully written book that highlights the lives of a dozen or so characters whose stories are interrelated and interwoven with one another around one single event -- Philippe Petit's historic tightrope walk between the Twin Towers in 1974. But the book is only minimally about the tightroping event itself, and more about the people whose lives are changed, directly or indirectly, on that day. Each character was distinct and fully formed, and while there were a couple of characters whose stories I might have omitted (only because I didn't feel like their inclusion really added much to the story), on the whole it is wonderful. Moving, heartfelt, and ambitious in its scope. I had one tiny little quibble with the book -- that the character Claire was supposed to have gone to Yale in the 1950s, but women weren't admitted to Yale College until 1968. It's a small thing, but there are enough Yalies in the publishing world that someone should have caught that at some point along the way. :)We unexpectedly had a death in the family, and I found myself reading and finishing this book while in New York, which I certainly hadn't anticipated. It added a deeper resonance to the book, being back in New York for a memorial, and at the same time driving past the former World Trade Center site. Even if you haven't been to New York or you don't have a strong connection to the city, I would recommend it. Ultimately it's about the connections between all of us -- flawed, vulnerable human beings -- and the visions we have for our lives and ourselves."

I won't state the obvious about the main character (hint: his initials; see pg. 155 in the paperback) because I do think it diminishes the power of this novel to name him. What did I learn from this book? Memorable characters - not just our favorite monk, but Gloria and Jazzlyn's mother, too - loving in unexpected ways. I want stories to do this for me: show me the truth, teach me how to have hope. At the end, when Jasslyn wants to know if her mother was loved and Corrigan (the core)'s brother dismisses the idea: how wrong he was. She was fiercely loved, the way God loves us. So the investment banker who talks of loss and lives safely but unfruitfully in his childhood home, married to someone who may or may not have been involved in his brother's death - either he denies love or doesn't recognize it. Ironic how the judge is so focused on the case of the tightrope walker that he misses the story of Jazzlyn and her mother, walking a different, daily tightrope. He would have missed it anyway; he missed a big chunk of his wife's story. Where is our attention? As I read, I'm taking notes when I just can't help myself: and here are the notes I took on a scrap of paper found in my purse, from the end of the novel:Jasslyne was looking for a history of love, and J.C. did love her mother, not with the what one character calls that human flow of desire, not as I experience love, but nonetheless love. It was love without desire, a love which was exquisitely more than her pimps, johns and own mother did. JC's love even released her mother's love towards Jasslyn: what a miracle. "

It's crystalline prose left me at times literally catching my breath-as though no one could write lines so beautiful and so perfect.Let the Great World Spin by Colum McCann is set in New York City, in 1974 when the World Trade Towers (then newly built) was crossed by a man on a tightrope (well, actually a steel cord). Down below people are struggling in a city seemingly hell-bent to self-destruct. There is a radical, gentle Irish priest, a mother and daughter who are both prostitutes whom the priest befriends, and a variety of other brilliantly realized characters struggling to make their life meaningful in a world that says different.I was in my early 20s living in NYC at the time this was written (having been born there). I lived close to the Bronx where so much of the action takes place. The book brought back memories of a city that I'd mostly forgotten (although I think the picture is a little one-sided but no matter, I'm a little defensive about my city, especially before it became all gentrified). The book is filled with raw pain but transmuted by beautiful language into a kind of poetry.I didn't cry but I ached all over from both the beauty and the pain. Everyone should read this book. If I haven't convinced you, it's because this review is too weak. But the book is as brilliant a piece of writing and as moving a story (or stories, since every character has a life to share) as you'll ever hope to read."

It didn't have the final cover art on it, just a plain cover with a bunch of glowing, hyperbolic review excerpts. It's obviously being promoted as a masterpiece. I generally avoid books that receive a lot of hyperbole. Usually, it's just BS. However, ""Let the Great World Spin"" truly deserves the accolades and I really believe it deserves the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2010.It's kind of difficult to describe this book. According to the blurb, it's about the guy who walked between the Twin Towers on a high wire back in the Seventies and how that walk connected people from different walks of life. It's not about that. Yes, the man on the wire is part of the story, but his walk isn't really a catalyst for anything. Instead, this book is about people and how they come together across lines that otherwise divide them. It's a microcosm of New York City in the Seventies. It's a series of short stories told from different viewpoints that are all interconnected the way people are interconnected.Probably the most amazing thing about ""Let the Great World Spin"" is how real the characters are. In each section, a different character tells his or her story and each one sounds completely unique and authentic. Whether whether the narrator is an Irish immigrant, a coked-up artist, or an aging whore, you truly believe each one is real.This is an incredibly fascinating book and one that any literature fan should read."

A number of stories intertwine in August of 1974, playing off Philippe Petit's famous outlaw wirewalk on a cable stretched between the twin towers of the World Trade Center. The important theme of this book is not that things end, but that things go on. Maybe our lives are like threads a couple of feet long twined into a much longer rope, tied to a chain, attached to a 250-foot length of 450 lb. cable, enabling a stunt that immortalizes a man, a structure, a city, a civilization. Sometimes when we think that our story is over, it turns out it's only a prelude of a much larger story, which itself spins into an even larger one. Maybe in that context, we're all immortal. McCann's mastery of the different characters' unique voices is impeccable. I particularly loved the part centering on Tillie, the Bronx hooker, and the descriptions of Petit's preparations for his magnificent stunt. But all the characters, however high or low in the social strata, or however exasperating, are understandable and even lovable when you see the world through their eyes."

""Failure didn't even cross his mind....Within seconds he was pureness moving, and he could do anything he liked. He was inside and outside his body at the same time, indulging in what it meant to belong to the air, no future, no past, and this gave him the offhand vaunt to his walk. He was carrying his life from one side to the other.""This uplifting historic event loosely ties together the lives of other New Yorkers who were touched by it in some way. The interwoven stories are about ordinary people--an Irish monk and his brother, hookers, artists, a wealthy judge, and a group of mothers who lost their sons in the Vietnam War. The beautifully written novel shows us life, death, joy, sorrow, and redemption. It is a slice of life in New York City in the 1970s before the Twin Towers became a site of tragedy on 9/11.

But I was wrong in postponing it for so long because everything else is on the verge of awesomeness.

The Bronx, the part of the city that burned in the seventies, is at the heart of Colum McCann’s highly esteemed novel. This is a story centered on prostitution and its social effects. A story of the ”Projects” (and the fight to stay alive) with the palpable sense of danger, of the drug taking, and muggings, the stairwells and walkways.It’s also an era when the USA as a nation was on its downers; the era of Nixon, and a time, by 1974, the pivotal year of the book, when Vietnam brought shame to America; a country, by now flying home thousands of young, dead, American servicemen, to grieving parents.There’s some humour, and loads of redemptive human kindness too. McCann creates strong, believable characters. The (Irish) Corrigan brothers, Ciaran and John, travel to America from their own troubled, native province. The featured prostitutes, mother Tillie Henderson and daughter Jazzlyn, both laugh and love (each other) despite the nature of their ‘work’ turning ‘tricks’ underneath the Major Deegan Expressway.John Corrigan devotes himself to ‘happiness’ and  Let The Great World Spin is ultimately a book of hope. In all there are eleven different protagonists and as the story emerges it does so to reveal connections between them. It’s nicely done and the 2019 Booker Prize winner  Girl, Woman, Other  (by Bernadine Evaristo) uses the same technique to great effect. Highlights•	Philii Petit, the tightrope walker  “Those Who Saw Him Hushed”. Though he is not named until the Author Note, Petit’s 1974 high wire story is told from the imagined perspective of the man himself, and from the multiple perspectives of chance onlookers. Wonderment.•	The relationship, the lifelong friendship between Gloria and Claire. Gloria is a woman whose unshakable compassion and fortitude in the face of a series of personal mishaps is truly life affirmingLowlightsMcCann sets out to reveal New York City as an entity made up of numerous microcosms. A couple of the side stories were a bit detached for me.•	Fernando Yunque Marcano, the""Imagist"", photographing the underside of the City. A world of spray cans, and tags. Maybe this is an offset for the glamour of the tightrope? but It’s not sufficiently developed, I felt.•	Dennis, Gareth, Compton, and narrator, Sam Peters. Computer coders and the superbly named Sable Senatore. Is this part of the book designed to highlight how all America was watching?Historical & Literary* The book title comes from the poem ""Locksley Hall"" by Lord Tennyson. This was itself inspired by 6th century Arabic poems- the Mu’allaqat. The themes are those of catharsis, and of musing about the past; it also represents the hopes of global peace.In an Author’s note at the end of the book, McCann quotes“pilots of the purple twilight dropping down with costly bales” (Tennyson)“ Is there any hope that this desolation can bring me solace?” (Mu’allaqat)* Philippe Petit Lives on, and his New York feats were the subject of a film “Man On Wire” in 2008* This is a 9/11 novel. A picture used in the book, with airplane, and the tightrope walker, both offset against the twin towers says it all.Questions In the Bronx a coyote lives on the underpass, and is shot dead. There must be some connection between this urban dog, and it’s fate, and the other mention of a coyote, in the wild, gliding over snow which kills men? Author background & ReviewsThe book won the 2009 U.S. National Book Award and the 2011 International Dublin Literary Award. Colum McCann is certainly versatile, and his books are quite different.

93,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/991805-margaret,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5/5The frame story that contains this novel is based on Philippe Petit’s August 7, 1974 daredevil performance of crossing from the top of one tower of the World Trade Center to the top of the other. Colum McCann begins his novel with and returns frequently to Petit’s illicit traverse, which in addition to capturing the attention of those New Yorkers who witnessed it or heard about it from other witnesses, captured the attention of the whole world. We hear about the event directly from McCann in some of the most poetic language in the book and through the stories of a series of New Yorkers who, at first, seem to be connected only by the fact of being New Yorkers on the ground witnessing the tightrope-walker’s breathtaking performance. As daring as that great feat was, the heart of the book resides with the many New Yorkers whose stories are revealed in this most beautifully written novel. Their lives are what matter, and the tightrope-walker, who remains anonymous in the novel, serves to symbolize the glory that is woven through every character’s life. McCann’s language soars with the glory of great deeds and hangs low with the drug addicts as they try to quit or quit trying to quit and get on with their task of earning money to feed their habits. McCann speaks all ways and always well, making this a book that would be as striking to listen to as it is to read.	The first on-the-ground character we meet is the independent, do-it-himself priest Corrigan, who has left Ireland to serve in New York City, where his apartment remains open for the prostitutes (who are largely heroin addicts) in the Bronx to use as their powder room and lounge. Immediately, we admire this man who sees service to God as service to people in need, and we get to meet the many people he serves. His inner beauty beautifies everyone around him. Standing out are Tillie, a prostitute who calls herself Sweet Cakes, and her prostitute daughter, Jazzlyn. In addition to befriending and caring for the prostitutes, he serves senior citizen residents in a nursing home by taking them on trips in his van. He meets others who work in the nursing home, in particular, a woman with two young children, all of whom Corrigan comes to love in his own fashion. His brother Ciaran comes from Ireland to visit his brother and to convince him to leave New York and move to California. It is McCann’s gift to present a variety of individuals, all of whom we feel we know. 	We then meet a group of middle-aged women who meet together to discuss their sons, all of whom have died while fighting in Vietnam. And we meet their extended families. And there are other characters too: a judge, a couple of pot-smoking hippies in town for the day, a teenage photographer shooting pictures of all the gang tags he sees in and on the subways, a computer expert, and so on. Part of this book’s gift to its readers is its ability to make us think we are experiencing the widest swath of New Yorkers, even though so many are ignored. There is little space for the working stiffs and their families, for students and teachers, for shopkeepers and shoppers, for so many of the ordinary folks that live everywhere, including in New York City. Despite this, the world of characters in this novel feels expansive. Connected at first by being New Yorkers, these characters come to meet each other as McCann weaves their stories together. The connections remain believable, even though McCann economically manages to connect almost everyone to everyone else. And that is somehow his point, if this novel has a point, that we are all a part of an enormous web of humanity that this great world has spun."

Or the best cut of steak.Let the Great World Spin is one of them. This book started a little slow for me. For much of the first chapter, I thought, Okay, it's pretty good. But then I came to the second chapter. And McCann's word play with his characters — women who lost their boys in Vietnam — swept me up and never let me go 'til I came to the last page. Take this snippet of a scene where Claire recalls her son first shaving:""Made an avenue through the cheek, but nicked himself on the neck. Tore off a tiny piece of his Daddy's Wall Street Journal. Licked it and pasted it to the wound. The business page clotting his blood. Walked around with the paper on his neck for an hour. She had stood at the bathroom door smiling. My big tall boy, shaving. Long ago, long ago. The simple things come back to us. They rest for a moment by our ribcages then suddenly reach in and twist our hearts a notch backward.""""No newspapers big enough to paste him back together in Saigon.""Or choice sentences like this one: ""She had the bluest eyes, the looked like small drops of September sky.""I loved that line..so much. And sometimes, all it takes is for the odd sentence like this to jump out at you and make you fall in love with a writer. With McCann, readers are graced with an author who takes such care with his words that it's a beautiful thing to read them, to ponder what he was thinking when he formed them, to watch the stories of these characters play out.To the unfamiliar, the premise of this book is a series of vignettes, all woven around characters who together share the commonality of witnessing (or hearing about) Philippe Petit walking a tightrope wire across the World Trade Center towers in August 1974. How McCann brings these characters - an Irish priest, a hooker in the pen, a grieving mother and more - together is a testament to his incredible talent as a writer. It's no wonder this book hit it big on so many Best of Lists in '09.By far one of the most memorable books I've read in ages, with stories that will stick with me for years to come.Recommended for: Fans of great contemporary writing, readers who loved The Hours "

But by the time I got to the second part and was so bored to death, I gave up. Sad, because I thought this book had a good premise and was original and different from other books out on the shelves these days. Unfortunately, the synopsis does the book more justice than what it deserves. The writing style at first was interesting and enjoyable, but slowly became annoying and aggravating as the author kept going on and on and on with the descriptions. I felt like yelling, enough already...I get it...I get it. I thought that if I had to read the entire book I'd be tearing my eyes right out of my head and would never pick up another novel again. The characters had no depth, no meaning and no reason for me to be reading about them. The author was vague and indescript about who they really were or where they really came from and even why they chose the paths they were on (that apparently eventually somehow intertwines with each other in a way that they never even really realize happened). The plot was meaningless. There was no reason behind it. Nothing that would make me say, so that's why it had to be written. The book in a nut shell: Random, everyday, mundane, meaningless, lives of a bunch of people happen to cross by each other at some point in their mundane boring lives. The end. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I am surprised by the rather good rating. Maybe it was just me. Maybe it just wasn't what I needed at the time. But this book is just another added to the shelves with all the other meaningless crap out there these days. Will someone please write a decent novel!"
97,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"One of my children's beloved books, The Man Who Walked Between the Towers, is a beautiful rendering of Philippe Petit's 1974 tightrope walk between the roofs of the twin towers. Let the Great World Spin opens with that very same scene, written for adults but no less vivid and captivating. The writing was powerful, and I was immediately hooked.Petit's famous walk proved to be a motif for this novel, which was really a series of interconnected stories about various individuals whose lives intersect before, during, and after this event. Periodically McCann returns to Petit himself (unnamed in the novel) and to his walk after a series of vignettes about the book's other characters. The vignettes are all beautifully written, perhaps a bit too beautifully. There are times when the writing feels self-conscious and deliberately crafted, although that usually doesn't detract. A few of the vignettes were slower and less interesting and one seemed completely unnecessary. Additionally, I'm not usually a short story reader so the novel-in-stories format tends to be less appealing to me. Criticism aside, though, this was a beautiful and admirable book that maintained my interest and will stay with me for a while."

This book is not recommend for people whose acrophobia is easily triggered by well crafted literary imagery.While technically a novel, Let the Great World Spin felt more like a collection of short stories that are loosely connected by Phillippe Petit's high wire walk between the World Trade Center in 1974. Some of the stories were good, some dragged on, some folded in well and others did not. It's not a bad book by any stretch, but I wasn't wasn't blown away by it, and I found the format kind of gimmicky. It's quite possible that my underwhelming feelings are related to my recent read of the epic City on Fire which is set in 1976/77 NYC featuring an ensemble cast of characters, all of which ultimately wove together in a meaningful way. I loved City on Fire, this one not so much."

Was it a life changing story for me? No, but the exquisiteness of such mundane details and the normalacy of it all, really made the story come alive. Also, that Colum McCann was able to keep the momentum of these details flowing throughout the whole novel, from beginning to end, absolutely astounded me, and I don't get astounded very often.I would most certainly recommend this one to Joyce fans and people who like strong details. This book kept my interest from beginning to end and I would consider picking up another book by this author in the future, once I've taken a mental break and read some ""fluff,"" just saying."

106,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3834516-george,Rating 2 out of 5,"First a caveat: I set this book down at page 117. That's why I added it to my ""pushed aside"" shelf. I guess I'm a bad person. This book won the national book award last year and the reviews are appreciative but I struggled with it and was never lost in it; I was always on the outside looking in. It was a writer moving his characters around and constructing pages of prose that I experienced as I waded through its pages, not actual people. I blame the prose itself for making it impossible for me to suspend my disbelief. I can't count the number of passages where McCann, having described a tableau two or three times from different angles and in different ways using different methods, takes a writerly breath (i.e. starts a new paragraph) and launches into yet more description of the same scene, or the same group of characters, or even the same moment in time. By way of example, I flipped through the book and found a few of my annotations in the margins:""he's a little too in love with this"" (p.4)""this is all a bit long winded"" (p.89)""unnecessary: some things should be left unsaid."" (p.96)""bored here -- feels repetitive"" (p.100) I'd quote the actual text itself except I'm afraid I'd fill up my entire hard disk. I included page numbers so you can look up the passages themselves if you really want to. It is not the absolute length that's so vexing of course, it's the repetitiveness, the lack of efficiency, that makes reading McCann so tiresome. Unfortunately, the feeling you get is that the author holds his descriptive abilities in much higher esteem than the novel itself would suggest, so we get lots of description, lots of exposition, and very little in the way of payoff. He simply likes describing stuff ""richly"" -- ahem. But I shouldn't wrap up my comments without mentioning at least one positive aspect of the book -- and there are some nice passages. I feel somewhat neutral towards the book's structure, which uses the trope of the French tightrope walker who crossed the newly built World Trade Center towers in 1973, the year they were completed (plenty of detail on that in the review below) -- McCann uses this incident as a device to bind together otherwise unrelated stories in NY at that time (who knows they may converge but I stopped reading 117 pages through so I guess I'll never know). It's an interesting technique I suppose, but I find that this kind of overt structural experimentation rarely succeeds, and I can't think of many books I genuinely enjoy that employ it. But there are some moments of brilliance in the prose. He's particularly successful with a technique used to great effect by the likes of Saul Bellow in which the limited omniscient third person narrator switches abruptly and yet seamlessly back and forth between external description and internal rumination, as in this passage where the central character, a middle-aged Upper East Side mother whose son, a computer expert, was killed in Vietnam, welcomes her fellow 'Nam mothers in mourning over for coffee while thoughts and memories of her boy's departure overseas are still ringing in her head."" -Hello, she says, hello hello hello. Marcia! Jacqueline! Look at you! Come in, oh, I love your shoes, Janet, this way, this way. Gloria! Oh, hi, oh, look, please, come in, it's lovely to see you. The only thing you need to know about the war, son, is: Don't go""This kind of juxtaposition rings psychologically true to me. Still, it was not enough for me to keep reading. There are too many great books to read to dawdle on mediocre or unmoving ones.   "

A construção da narrativa de “Deixa o Grande Mundo Girar” assenta num acontecimento real - no dia 7 de Agosto de 1974, o francês Philippe Petit, caminha sobre uma corda bamba, colocada entre as Torres Gémeas no World Trade Center, em Nova Iorque, 110 andares e cerca de 400 metros acima do solo; um evento absolutamente inesperado que é o fio condutor de um romance, composto pelas várias “histórias” de onze personagens, onze protagonistas, homens e mulheres, com capítulos específicos e individuais, que se vão entrelaçando, como uma teia que progressivamente se vai construindo e unindo a vários níveis e com várias tramas, num plano existencial e emocional, onde o conflito e a tensão dramática atingem uma profundidade e um sentido comovente. Das inúmeras “histórias” destaco: a dos irmãos irlandeses Corrigan e Ciaran, desde Dublin, na Irlanda até Bronx, em Nova Iorque; a das prostitutas negras, mãe e filha, Tillie e Jazzlyn; a de Claire e do seu marido, o juiz Solomon Soderberg, que vivem num sumptuoso apartamento em Park Avenue, Nova Iorque, e que tentam lidar com a morte do seu único filho na guerra do Vietnam; a de Gloria, uma negra, que tal como Claire, pertence ao grupo das mães que perderam os filhos na guerra; a de Lara e Blaine, jovens artistas em recuperação do consumo excessivo de drogas. Colum McCann escreve um excelente romance, com uma coerência arrebatadora, unindo vários estilos narrativos, repletos de originalidade; várias “histórias”, numa metáfora que se reescreve com base na “imagem” de um misterioso funâmbulo que percorre a corda bamba entre as Torres Gémeas em 1974 (Colum McCann omite deliberadamente o nome de Philippe Petit), numa analogia inevitável com os acontecimentos trágicos ocorridos a 11 de Setembro de 2001 - num relato sobre o amor e a perda, sobre as vidas destruídas pela morte e pela dor, de pessoas que lutam desesperadamente por recuperar o seu equilíbrio e a sua redenção.

This book is a swamp of sappy, self-indulgent writing that does little to hide the fact that it is full of one-dimensional characters loosely tied together in a very sad attempt to prove the vague, yet obvious point that history repeats itself, everything is connected, and life goes on. If you can’t believe that such clichés could really be the themes of this book, don’t worry – the author repeats them to you about 20 times in the last few pages, probably hoping to convince himself that, yes, THIS was what he really meant to write about, rather than just a collection of haphazard garbage. He even admits that he didn’t really know what he was doing in the author’s notes and interview – the perfect finale to his self-indulgence – again, using vague and flowery language to remind us that “you never know where a book will take you” and “everyone finds their own meaning – or sometimes there is no meaning at all!” (My sarcastic paraphrases – not the author’s words.) I wish I could include some direct quotes in this review because it is really fun to mock them, but alas, I have buried this book far, far away from me. If you want, you can create your own quotes in the style of Colum McCann, using his favorite descriptive phrase, “like a sort of.” For example:My cat craps in his litter box, like a sort of animal.(For more accuracy to the author’s style, use more random adjectives, mixed metaphors, and sentence fragments.)PS. This book narrowly missed being put on my “utter garbage” shelf because I actually did learn something interesting from it.

A thin disguise to velcro stories together.There are sometimes contemporary, historical, or pop-culture references that sometimes held me into the section for a little longer, but all in all I was rarely engaged and never felt it to be a page turner. If the book mysteriously disappeared before I finished, I don't think I would be upset or even bother to replace it.I thought I would stretch myself with this book, but it disappointed me greatly.

Sono storie di persone e ambienti messe lì come quadri di una galleria rappresentativa di quella metropoli che - il passato scarno, il futuro incerto - “vive in un presente costante”, una metropoli spesso oscura, opprimente, una sorta di grandissimo tunnel con appena una luce lontana sul fondo…ma poi, all’improvviso, “lassù, quella sagoma spettrale, quell’inerzia scura contro il cielo, un minuscolo trattino davanti all’immensità”: eccolo dunque un modo per elevarsi al di sopra delle quotidiane bassezze!

Un romanzo corale in cui Colum McCann, irlandese di nascita ma naturalizzato statunitense, affronta alcuni dei temi che hanno caratterizzato gli Stati Uniti negli anni ’70: la guerra del Vietnam, il pregiudizio razziale, il degrado delle periferie newyorkesi, il riscatto e il grande sogno americano; non sono un’esperta della società americana, ma mi sembra che alcune di queste tematiche siano ancora presenti e non risolte. L’autore cerca di ritagliare un momento preciso, il mattino del 7 agosto 1974 alle 7:15 in cui il funambolo Philippe Petit percorre su un cavo d’acciaio la distanza tra le Twin Towers e lo fa per ben sei volte: è un evento che catalizza l’attenzione di tantissimi americani (newyorkesi soprattutto ma non solo) che si ritrovano a seguire con intensa partecipazione la passeggiata tra le torri del World Trade Center, costruite da pochi mesi. Ma il mondo continua a girare: si continua a soffrire, lottare, sperare, amare, disprezzare in un labirinto in cui la sapiente mano dell’autore ci guida elevando pian piano il nostro sguardo per mostrarci che ogni cosa è collegata alle altre.

Понякога той става по-осезаем именно заради напускането.Някой ден ще вървите в тъмното и истината изведнъж ще блесне, а зад гърба ви ще остане един живот, за който не ще искате да си спомняте.На определен етап всяко нещо може да бъде знак.Нещо се случва в човешкия ум в миговете на ужас. Вероятно решаваме, че това е последното, което ще видим, и го запечатваме за остатъка от дългото си пътуване. Заснемаме перфектни фотографии, албум, над който да страдаме. Подрязваме ъгълчетата и ги нареждаме. Скриваме някъде тетрадката с изрязаните кадри, за да я извадим, когато сме съсипани.Сбогом, радвам се, че се запознахме, ще се видим в новините.Има една песен, която харесвам, но не обичам да слушам.Веднъж ми каза, че през повечето време хората използват думата любов просто като още един начин да покажат, че са гладни. Ама го каза някак така: „За да възвеличат апетита си.“Като всичко необичайно, бе закономерно.У нея имаше някаква свирепа красота, някакъв архив на любовта.Особеното на любовта е, че ни кара да оживяваме в чуждо тяло.Понякога да се връщаш назад към минали събития е грешка, породена от гордост, но ми се струва, че човек може да живее с години вътре в даден момент, да се придвижва напред заедно с него, да го усеща как набъбва и пуска корените си във всичко наоколо.Може би историите ни трябва да се делят на такива къси отрязъци, да почват и да свършват в подобни моменти, моменти на смях, но всъщност нещата не започват и не свършват, те просто си вървят.Странно е как човек се закрепя в свой си малък свят и изпитва дълбока нужда да говори, всеки за своята история, като някак странно я започва от средата и после неистово се мъчи да я сглоби цялата, да я направи смислена, логична и категорична.Почнеш ли да забравяш, си изгубен.Предлагах им само истини и никаква честност.Казах му, че го обичам, че винаги ще го обичам и се почувствах като дете, което хвърля сентаво във фонтан и после има нужда да сподели с някого фантастичното си желание, макар да знае, че то трябва да се пази в тайна и казването му може да развали магията. Той ми отговори да не се притеснявам, защото монетата може да изскочи от фонтана пак и пак, и пак.Някои хора си мислят, че любовта е краят на пътя и ако имаш късмет да я откриеш, оставаш там. Според други тя е стръмна скала, от която се хвърляш, но онези, които са имали време да я поопознаят, са наясно, че тя се променя всеки ден и в зависимост от това колко настървено се бориш, може да се добереш до нея, да я задържиш, да я загубиш, а понякога се оказва, че просто изначално я е нямало.Бях на двайсет и две. Просто исках дните ми за малко да станат по-вълнуващи, да посягам към обикновените неща в живота си и да ги превръщам в нещо ново, без никакви задължения към миналото.Някаква част от мен смята, че продължаваме да ��ъществуваме на определени места дори след като сме ги напуснали.Тя караше дори дребните жестове да изглеждат изключителни и необходими.Човекът с когото се запознаваме, мисли си тя, не е онзи, с когото се разделяме.Ние пристъпваме, мисли си Джейзлин, за да внесем малко шум в тишната, да намерим в другите продължение на себе си. И почти нищо друго не ни е нужно."

August 1974 - The Twin Towers and Philippe Petit is walking across a wire strung between the two buildings. There he is up, at the very top, doing the absolutely most craziest of things. Go look for yourself if you've never heard of him or this act of ______. I don't know how to complete that sentence. Link: http://gothamist.com/2009/04/13/petit... Documentary: Man on Wire - NetflixDon't let all this talk of Petit fool you though. Really, he plays a small role in this book. It is a novel in which characters are segmented out into chapters and woven together in chapters and then hidden for some time only to resurface and offer you more. And while this book construction often makes me snarl with displeasure, here, it was like finding more cookies magically in the cookie jar. Oh those crafty Keebler elves which helped McCann construct this book.Corrigan, a young Irish monk begins the novel, we see him and his brother in their youth. Corrigan then moving to the Bronx where he becomes a poor philanthropist of sorts to prostitutes and the elderly. His younger brother eventually moves into the dilapidated apartment and then the woven stories begin.A group of mothers meet regularly to mourn their sons killed in Vietnam. One of the mothers, Gloria, stole my heart. Her story is enchanting and I want McCann to write a book solely about her and her story. She is fascinating and comical in light of her losses in life.Out of the gaggle of prostitutes surrounding Corrigan's apartment, McCann places a very interesting woman before the reader, Tillie. Tillie is a thirty-eight year old grandmother who has a daughter, a vibrant beauty, also a prostitute, who has children at a young age. You are witness to their struggles and a circular life. Their inability to change and thus it continues from mother to daughter the adversities. It makes you feel weary. But their reality, though it may not be the life most want to lead, there is love and Corrigan plays a large part here. McCann takes an interesting lead character and places him in so many pivotal lives. He is a monk askew or is he?As the novel comes to a close, many years later, Jaslyn (grand daughter to Tillie) shares her life with the reader. She is well aware of her past. She is confident in her future. All that McCann wove together lies inside this character. A woman beautiful inside and out. You feel every character is part of her.I felt New York throbbing in my veins as I read each chapter. It's been a long time since I visited New York and I miss it. I was sad to reach the last page, the last paragraph, the last sentence, the last word. It felt as if I as on a plane, lifting off the runway, and I know it will be a long time since I can visit again. "

E' come se l'autore fosse meno interessato allo sviluppo della trama che alla possibilità di offrirla attraverso infinite rifrazioni che ne ridefiniscono via via l'integrità e l'essenza.Questo accade soprattutto (ma non solo...) con le opere americane e ""Questo bacio vada al mondo intero"" ne è un tipico esempio: per quanto sopra premesso il romanzo non ha un vero protagonista anche se tutto sembra ruotare intorno alla figura del funambolo che, fatto realmente accaduto, attraversò, su un cavo ad oltre 400 m. di altezza, i circa 60 metri che separavano le torri del World Trade Center. Il libro di McCann ha quindi un'unità di luogo nella Grande Mela (anche se con qualche ricordo personale di personaggi delle più disparate provenienze geografiche) e un'unità di tempo in quanto le azioni si svolgono per lo più nel 1974, nei giorni dell'impresa del funambolo.Contrapposta a questa unità vi è una molteplicità di storie, ""un crocevia di voci e destini"" come scrive la quarta di copertina, che con un certo virtuosismo l'autore conduce ricostruendo una ragnatela di rapporti, inevitabili o casuali, dai quali traspare perfino (e questo è più inconsueto nella narrativa odierna) una notevole dose di bontà e di generosità che non ti aspetteresti in una metropoli identificata spesso come sinonimo dell'alienazione contemporanea.Il fatto stesso, che inevitabilmente accompagna la nostra lettura, di una folla eterogenea di persone col batticuore, la bocca aperta e lo sguardo rivolto verso la cima delle torri per guardare l'impresa di un individuo, sbalorditiva come un gesto di amore universale e non orribile come un atto di immane e indiscriminata violenza, sottolinea la nostra distanza anche psicologica rispetto a quel mondo del 1974, non certo tenero e felice ma ancora ingenuo ed altruista."

Beautifully written - the author really paints with words. He creates such descriptions that you do not simply see the atmosphere in front of your eyes - you become part of it... They teach on those creative writing courses that you should use lots of adjectives to make your sentences ""interesting"". I never understood why. And here is example - he almost neglects adjectives but it works for the best... So poetic... Of course as the novel set in New York the City reins in it. ... And sad - yes, the initial impression was that it is just another story showing how the Evil wins the Good in real life in contrast to the fairy tale or religion... And i did not like it but kept going as i liked the language so much... But somewhere at the middle when you think the worst definitely happened with the characters you unexpectedly start to feel much more powerful message - there is goodness in this world. You never know in which form it would appear and how, and may be not in your case, but there is place for it and it is not empty... In terms of the plot the book consists of a number of loosely connected life stories. The connection is the Tightrope Walker between the Twin Towers in 1974. It is unnecessary to go into the plot, but the one of the characters describes this act ""beautiful and reckless"" And the main idea which would stay with me from this book that it is like a big symbol for the life in general, the life we live, beautiful and recklessTo follow my little tradition a quote to end this review: ""Some people think love is the end, and if you're lucky enough to find it, you stay there. Other people say it just becomes a cliff you drive off, but most people who've been around awhile know it's just a thing that changes day by day, and depending on how much you fight for it, you get it, or hold on to it, or you lose it..."""
126,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3967051-david-carr,Rating 5 out of 5,"One morning almost exactly thirty-nine years ago, Philippe Petit walked a wire stretched between the World Trade Center towers, a quarter-mile above the streets of lower Manhattan. The image of that event towers over this novel in much the same way, epitomizing the precarious expectations of human beings, the dire constraints of living without aspirations, and the fragility of one life, always in balance. And so, the risk of the circus act outside the tent does what all humans require of art.McCann accomplishes so many difficult things in this book. As we would learn when they were gone, the great towers here are formidable yet invisible parts of the lives of everyone who looks up. The speck of a man dancing between them early on an August morning catches the imagination across multiple stories. The stories connect to the man, but also to each other, linked by events and shared lives. Each life evinces truth, but not great truth: these are authentic lives, not heroic ones. People struggle with whatever they are given to be. The events of the novel are from the last century, the nineteen-seventies, in New York City. That maelstrom is recaptured by powerful details of summer heat and smell, by the despair of an unfinished war, by graffiti and rust. But in these pages it is also present in the less vivid, more personal maelstrom made of faith, drugs, death, and sex for sale. The novelist knows that things happen, but there is nothing to explain or justify: we just walk the wire. It isn't triumph, illusion or disappointment that matters; it is simply that a life is in the walking. Such books as this one make our knowledge of the world larger. When we are done reading it we are both grateful and humble beyond words, even these."

This novel zooms in on the lives of a few of the thousands of anonymous people who stared in awe at the tiny man-dot moving back and forth on a wire 110 stories in the air. Not all of the characters saw that moment, but each feels its influence. Father John Corrigan, who has an unorthodox ministry to girls who walk the streets, is bringing one of them, Jazzlyn, home from jail to her two young daughters. Judge Solomon Sonderberg has just dispensed quickly with Jazzlyn and her mother in order to focus on Petit, whose presence in court creates a welcome change from the lives of despair he usually sees. Solomon’s wife, Claire, watches the tight rope walk from the roof of her Park Avenue building with a group of other mothers mourning sons lost in Vietnam. One of those women, Gloria, is a neighbor to Father Corrigan in a violent project building in the Bronx. When an artist couple from upstate New York clip Father Corrigan’s van, the collision results in tragedy and brings the lives of these disparate people together in an equation that equals grace. This isn’t going to be a favorite novel of mine, but I’m glad I read it. McCann does a fine job of capturing the voices of the city, and although in places it was frustrating as a reader to keep switching back and forth between stories, he allows us to see New York, 1974, with a wide-angle lens, giving perspective to what has happened since and reinforcing the belief that we are all in this life together."
128,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1977511-kat,Rating 2 out of 5,"This novel had rave reviews and won the National Book Award for 2009, but in spite of the fact that it contains some wonderful writing, I was never able to warm to it. Set in New York in the mid-seventies, the book uses the historical moment when Phillip Petit walked a high-wire between the two towers as a touchstone for a portrait of the city and an indirect exploration of 9/11 grief. His characters are many, diverse, and briefly sketched: an Irish monk whose work lies among city hookers; the monk's Latina love interest; a white, visual artist whose drug experiences have led to tragedy; an African-American prostitute; a Jewish matron grieving for the son she lost in Vietnam; a Latino boy who rides the subways photographing graffiti, among others. McCann's major triumph seems to be that he was able to create a different voice for each of these, but I found myself comparing this achievement to ""great special effects"" in a film. The shadowy characters didn't satisfy; I hungered for more complexity. Perhaps I would feel differently if I were a New Yorker. "

By shooting a wire from one building to the next (with a bow and arrow I might add), he set up what would be a high-wire walk for the ages, perhaps the millennium.  This is the focal point of McCann’s ‘Let The Great World Spin’; a fictional account of the day from the perspective of an amalgamation of perceived low class and high class people of the hierarchal social order.  Each perspective told from the point of view of that day, chapter by chapter, it weaves in and out of emotions and thoughts such as love, hate, death, despair, self-image, religious and ideal epiphanies, to an eventual realization that brings everything together to a close.

We remember well the names Colson, Dean, Halderman, Erlichman, if we can't remember what exactly what it was that they did. On the other hand, we can remember clearly one man's actions, if not his name (not taking into account the excellent film made about his feat) -- Philippe Petit's successful dance between the Two Towers was the stuff of instant legend. This book weaves a tapestry of individuals whose lives are transformed by this their connections, some more tenuous than others, to his act.

Un libro in cui le vite si intrecciano, si intersecano, si incrociano, da assaporare parola per parola, un libro intriso di vita, che ci fa capire che forse la felicità è davvero appesa a un filo, lo stesso filo che Philippe Petit, funambolo, cerca di attraversare sfidando il vuoto tra le Torri Gemelle.""La sola cosa per cui valeva la pena intristirsi era sapere che a volte in questa vita c'è più bellezza di quanta il mondo possa reggerne"".

The characters are unconvincing; their connections to each other and their interior monologues even more so. McCann does not have a good ear for American vernacular and thus the dialogue is frequently inauthentic and plagued with anachronisms. African Americans are particularly ill-served in this regard.A blurb from the New York Times Book Review inside my paperback edition proclaims that the book ""[feels:] like a precursor to ...

137,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"I'd sort of heard of this book but didn't know what it was about, and was very pleasantly surprised. (Part of the pleasant surprise was that much of the first chapter takes place in Dublin, and I'm a huge sucker for colorful descriptions of 1950s-1970s Ireland. Another part of the pleasant surprise is that this book is HELLA abolitionist and incorporates some really interesting ideas about restorative justice. So it checks a lot of boxes for me and I might, as a result, be a little biased.) McCann uses a variety of narrators to tell two stories--one of the 1974 tightrope walk between the Twin Towers, and one of a series of lives thrown off course by a car accident that coincidentally takes place on the same day--which converge remarkably. Part of the fun of the book is trying to figure out how the stories will come together, and McCann manages to weave nearly all of his varied narrators and plotlines together by the end. I was especially impressed by how unique each character's voice is: McCann makes a hard job look easy by giving the reader the sense that each chapter truly does come from a different character's perspective, and making each character someone we can empathize with.One of the book's main character is described as wanting ""a fully believable God, one you could find in the grime of the everyday. The comfort he got from the hard, cold truth—the filth, the war, the poverty—was that life could be capable of small beauties."" The novel serves as a gorgeous reminder that, while events and tragedies and plotlines are certainly part of our lives, life is ultimately not made of these major events--it is made of the small beauties, taken together.Thematically similar to The Great Believers."

It would be trite—and untrue—to suggest that the main character of this book is New York City itself. Instead, this book tells the stories of a brilliant collection of fully-realized characters, stories which could only have happened in the New York City of 1974–the “bad old days” before New York was sanitized for mass consumption. What unites all of these people is a series of events, coincidences even. But more importantly, they’re all united by having lived through tragedy and having to determine how to go on with their lives afterwards. And tragedy makes strange but ultimately intimate bedfellows. Some expected relationships collapse and some unexpected ones blossom and then flourish. You might be from a different walk of life or might be brought together in the worst of circumstances but at your core find a true kinship with another human.And all of this under the shining shadow of Philippe Petit’s famous high wire walk from one World Trade Center tower to the other, a reminder that truly astounding things can and do happen. And sometimes those things aren’t just wondrous displays in the sky but are instead the magic of creating something new from all the sorrow and chaos.The writing was lovely, with brilliant reviews prose and stunning shifts in style between sections.

McCann has a way with language--the repetitive gives his voice a kind of imperative quality. Reading about New York in any bygone era is a romantic indulgence for anyone who lived there afterward, and this is no exception. This book is one of those panoramic stories told by a dozen or so protagonists, whose lives intersect in variously profound and insignificant ways, not unlike Cloud Atlas or The Tsar of Love and Techno. It's hard to describe my reaction to the book--on the one hand, I enjoyed listening to it and was eager to finish when my library copy ""expired"" with a single chapter left. On the other, I'm left feeling a bit disappointed, like the characters were not meaty enough to leave a sustained impression in my mind. Only time will tell, I suppose. But McCann has already impressed me as a master of the written word, poetic and evocative. I'm sure I'll continue to read him and see where this slots into the oeuvre."

I wished we got less of some characters and wayyy more of others, some of their stories felt a bit unfinished to me.I also found some aspects of his style a bit superficial in terms of character voice (I also REALLY disliked the very long repetitive paragraphs, ie. “Death by _____” repeated I believe upwards of 20 times). But he also creates gorgeous imagery that really transported me.Despite my complaints, I couldn’t put it down when he finally started connecting the dots between characters.

Like the small tightrope walker who, in August 1974, inched his way along the steel thread he'd strung between the Twin Towers, and who brought the city beneath him to a near stop, the people of New York make their way onward, step-by-step, into what lies ahead. Prostitutes, priests, judges, mothers, pedestrians, artists, cops, bartenders, office workers, all balance themselves amid the frequent despair of life, best they can. Along the way, they fail, often. Wars take the sons of mothers. Prostitution and poverty rob the hopes of the young. Car accidents, and snap decisions, and failed marriages, and broken bureaucracies defeat even the most determined, as if life is little but randomness and chaos. And, as readers, we know what is coming--for the Twin Towers, for the people that inhabit them, for the city and the world, in the aftermath of 9/11. But McCann's story, made up of what sometimes feel like unconnected short stories, pulls us forward nonetheless, through the din and the danger. It's strands show us the links in lives, the rebirth and rebuilding, the foundation that, despite frequent destruction, grows stronger--captured brilliantly, in a moment, when a young man on a tightrope performs a death-defying act, against all odds, that makes every little corner of the chaotic world beneath him stop and look and wonder, in awe of the audacity of such hope."

It always was and I have a sense, no matter how it seems to be finally changing and not for the better in my opinion, it always will be a big messy pain in the ass of a city. I lived there all my life until I moved to Japan and I've been living in Tokyo for 10 years. I can't tell you what Tokyo is, what it's like. I could tell you what it is for me right now at this time of my life but that wouldn't tell you what Tokyo is. And for all the years and all my life and life times spent in New York City I can't tell you what it is. I can only say what it means to me at a certain time and in a certain place.This book does the same and that's about the best and the worst that I can say about it. It's frustrating at times, aggravating, even boring at times. Some of it seems cliché and done before or just plain uninteresting. A big old New York City, who gives a F...! But then there are times, the beautiful phrase here, an image over here, and interaction between characters that suddenly makes them come alive and makes me care about them. Something that touches me and touches my life as a New Yorker. As a human being. And sadness. So much sadness. Not the loud boisterous screaming curses in your face sadness. Not like some bag person yelling obscenities in the language no one can understand sadness but a deep down true sadness that comes with being alive. And the same choices, the mistakes and beauty that come with being alive. The incredible life of an incredible artist and performer, those descriptions made me so happy and broke my heart. I've had much more than my fair share of high wire acts, and falls. Of love and loss and never had. Of family and friends gone too soon. People I loved who slipped on the wire and disappeared. Who never even had a chance to fall to earth.I've put my hat out on the street, I've done my show and collected my nickels, dimes, quarters and maybe a dollar here or there. I know what that's like. I've done my fair share of birthday parties and home parties. And I've done my fair share of trying to make art in a city that increasingly doesn't seem to give a crap about art. Or about us. A city filled with people who don't give a crap about people either, except for the few, except for those who do care. Those are the people that make it all worthwhile.This is what I think and feel from reading this book. Should I tell you to go out and read it? I really liked it. A few of my friends don't like it, but as we say in New York City, ""Hey whaddyagonnado?"""

Capita che provochi commozione, brividi lungo la schiena, un senso di appartenenza verso ciò che stai ammirando. Ma più di tutto, ciò che la distingue è la sensazione di irripetibilità: la consapevolezza che stai assistendo a qualcosa che, seppur replicabile, non sarà mai più identico e non ti darà più le stesse emozioni che ti sta dando in quel preciso istante.Come ogni cosa su questo mondo, esiste anche il suo diretto opposto: la bruttezza oggettiva; e, per ironia del fato, ci sono luoghi in grado di attrarre su loro entrambe le cose: bellezza oggettiva e bruttezza oggettiva.Il 6 agosto 1974, Philippe Petit entra illegalmente nelle Torri Gemelle, si spaccia per un operaio di cantiere, si nasconde all'interno, con alcuni complici tende un cavo da una parte all'altra delle torri. Non lo fa per qualche colpo alla Lupin III o alla Ocean's Eleven; nè per qualcosa di ""malvagio"". Lui, su quel filo tirato, ci cammina: un ballerino tra le nuvole, un sognatore, un bacio dato al mondo intero.C'è una foto di lui mentre attraversa con alle spalle un aereo che sorvola la zona.L'11 settembre 2001, le Torri crollano per un attentato terroristico.Sono certa che sia chi ha assistito alla camminata, sia chi ha assistito al crollo, direttamente o indirettamente, tramite giornali e tv, si ricordi esattamente cosa stava pensando in quel preciso momento.Quei due episodi, hanno accomunato così tante persone: vari destini, vari passati, vari presenti si sono incrociati e sfiorati.Il più delle volte sono vite ordinarie. Altre volte sono vite negative, tristi, buie. In tutte loro, però, c'è sempre, nei punti più nascosti e remoti, uno sprazzo di luce...una bellezza oggettiva.Si tratta di scegliere da quale punto di vista osservare le cose. Si tratta di scegliere come e cosa ricordare. Si tratta di puntare sul bianco o sul nero. Le Torri Gemelle possono essere ricordate nel loro momento di massima meraviglia o nel loro momento più tragico. Io, tale è la potenza di questo libro, scelgo quello di massima meraviglia."
145,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy,Rating 3 out of 5," I was completely blown away by Colum McCann's 2003 novel Dancer, a fictional account of Rudolf Nureyev's life. Let the Great World Spin won the National Book Award in 2009 and got scads of glowing reviews, so I was excited to read it. And it was good, with some of the strengths of Dancer. McCann makes you love his characters because he finds the spirit beneath each one's faults and troubles. He clearly exults in New York City and has discovered its essence though he was raised in Ireland. One of my issues with this ""novel"" is that it is in fact a collection of short stories tied together by a time period and a group of characters. The book opens in August, 1974, when Phillippe Petit made his famous balletic tightrope crossing between the Twin Towers. The event is used as a symbol throughout the book and as a unifying device between a large group of characters who range from an unorthdox street priest to a few prostitutes to a Park Avenue woman. I am not a fan of short fiction and throughout my reading I was aware of the author's method of construction; he was too much there. Which brings me to my other issue: novels about 9/11. Though it has been almost a decade and though it must be an irresistible subject for authors who live in New York, for some reason almost every novel I have read with 9/11 as the central idea has made me just a tad queasy. Maybe it is just too soon to put that debacle of human insanity into art; maybe it is the relentless news coverage, the images from which still pop up uninvited in my consciousness; I just don't know. It all makes me squirm. Now that I have gotten all that off my chest, I can say that I did find myself drawn in to these characters' lives and their interactions. In fact by the end I cared quite deeply for the priest and the three generations of prostitutes. Unfortunately I did not like the final scene at all. I don't even like the review I have written here. It feels clunky, just as the book did. Worst of all, the reading group where I could have discussed all this did not meet, ostensibly because too many members were ill or out of town, but possibly because no one finished the book. Ah well. It is just one book among thousands."
146,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/426277-james-henderson,Rating 3 out of 5,"The world spins and our lives go on. Each of these lives is made up of words and stories that intersect with each other. The stories overlap and connections are made and broken. This novel takes up these notions and, adding a focal point with the event and wonder at the achievement of a mysterious tightrope walker in August, 1974, tells the stories of some lives of people in New York City whose world like ours was spinning. I was impressed with this novel filled with calamities and disorder, people from judges to prostitutes, the high and the low -- McCann was not afraid to portray the underbelly of society, the immigrants (one would not expect less from such a well-traveled Irish writer), and the magic of the funambulist at the center of it all. The disorder begins even before the two Irish brothers whose story opens the novel when one of them is knocked down by an explosion. There will be more disorder before their story ends, but the spinning theme is also the glue that ties the stories and the characters' world together with a sort of structure. The stories include those told by the mother of Corrigan and his brother: ""she would launch into a story of her own creation, fables that sent my brother and me to different places, and we would wake in the morning wondering if we had dreamed different parts of the same dream, or if we had duplicated each other, or if in some strange world our dreams had overlapped . . . We have all heard of these things before. The love letter arriving as the teacup falls. The guitar striking up as the last breath sounds out. I don't attribute it to God or to sentiment. Perhaps it's chance.""(p 68)Yes chance plays a role in the novel. But the intersection of lives also evokes the era, one centered on that famous tightrope walk between the twin towers. An era that was lost in September of 2011. The novel seems to lose focus at times, and it is story, not plot, driven. The overall effect is one that seems fitting to New York City (although there are many other stories of the city that are not included here) and the new milennium. Each reader will have to decide for himself what the stories mean."

През цялото време, докато четях “Нека големият свят се върти” на Колъм Маккан (ИК Жанет 45), си представях героите на книгата като серия от снимки в “Humans of New York” – парчета от пъзeл с лични истории, които се застъпват и търсят своето място в картината, която води читателя из калната магнетичност на Ню Йорк. Запечатани кадри на герои с истории, в които се отразяват ежедневните избори, натрупванията през поколения, случайността или просто съдбата.

Ню Йорк се промъква в разказите на всички, за да се превърне в онази оплитаща нишка, която в края имаш усещането че придържа всичко и нарежда историите така, че голямата картина е едновременно много тъжна и много красива реалистична снимка на живота...

148,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/962322-dennis,Rating 5 out of 5,"I’d never heard of this novel before I took it in a book swap and wonder how it got under my radar. Told in choral fashion, it was easily deserving of the recognition it received. It also shows how you can really come across some gems in these swaps (or used book sales) that you might never have noticed otherwise. The story is a fictionalized account of the day in 1974 when the Frenchman, Philippe Petit, put a tightrope between the twin towers of the nearly-completed World Trade Center in lower Manhattan and performed for about 45 minutes. Although the unnamed artist tells his story in various parts of the book, the novel is about the events in the lives of various other New Yorkers on that day, some directly affected and others only peripherally. The first part, about an Irishman come to join his missionary priest brother who’s living in a South Bronx slum, is the longest and slowest; he ministers to the prostitutes working there and it can easily make you give up on the book but it picks up as various characters tell their interconnected stories. To explain how they’re interconnected would be to give up too much of the story but there’s death, love, maternity, guilt and much else of what’s human spread over all the social classes. There are other references to the events of the time, such as Vietnam and art hippies, which blend in well to capture a day in an epoch, and which maybe show how little has changed since then.I hope to read some of Colum McCann’s other books soon because they’ve also received a lot of praise from my friends on Good Reads. I found this book beautifully human in how it shows emotions crossing social barriers and how we’re all interconnected. It gave me hope."

Yet this book too me so long to get into. For the most part reading it was much like looking at (most) impressionist art for me, something I can aesthetically appreciate but that doesn't really engage me. The quality is definitely here, there is a stunning beauty to McCann's writing, that and a great humanity. There was just something about the characters (and this is a very character driven piece) that for the most part (with few notable exceptions) failed to actively immerse. It might have been a very personal thing and some readers would probably find the characters much more relatable. This is a very episodic novel, told from many different perspectives during a memorable day in 1974 New York City when a wildly audacious funambulist (unnamed here, but a real person and a real act) walked the tight rope between The Towers. The characters are as varied of a menagerie as there can be, black, white, hispanic, wealthy, trashy, whores, judges. Their lives as different as can be manage to cross paths, interweaving, altering courses of events. Round and round goes the world. Only in the very end, the last shortest part of the book taking place in 2006, did the story really started to work for me, became the moving compelling experience it should have been all along presumably. So maybe this wasn't exactly what all the praise and awards have led me to expect, but it was a very solid, quite impressive work of literature and a worthy read."

I only give it a 3.5/5 stars, although I can see how others could think it was exceptional. It was very descriptive and the character development was very strong - although, at some times McCann's descriptions were a little too drawn out for my taste. McCann does succeed at getting you deep into the minds of the various characters. Which is a feat, given how varied they all are - several prostitutes, recovering drug addict, tight rope walker, priest, etc... However, all the characters are so deeply troubled that it makes for a somber read. It does give you a sense of what New York was like in the 70s. And it is impressive how McCann weaves together the lives of all these characters.I will say that after I finished, when reflecting on the story, it was fascinating to be able to view the same plot from within the heads of all these different, interrelated people. I guess in the end, it was an impressive feat of writing. I just didn't love the characters, so it was hard to love the book. But the point wasn't to make them lovable, it was to make them real. And he succeeded in conveying them as real and their lives as very hard. It just wasn't for me."

Or, you could say that there is something annoyingly sanctimonious about this book (almost as if the author wants you to know that he has a Big Heart, and that he Feels the Pain of Humanity). The author all but clubs the reader over the head with the Soft Stick of Redemption, Redemption, Redemption and by the end of it all, I was desperately spinning around for something to read as an antidote to the rather facile optimism of this novel-- something, say, by Samuel Beckett...That said, parts of the book are well-written (the opening, for one), though many more parts feel overwritten and over-elaborated. Like Franzen's ""Freedom,"" this novel attempts to paint a big picture, and to make some big points about life in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. ""Let the Great World Spin"" is a better book than ""Freedom,"" but it nonetheless feels suspiciously like one of those big, sentimental Academy Award(TM)-Winning Motion Pictures."

This contained many different vignettes that were not by any means woven together. These vignettes were all from one day in the 70's of various lives of different people and what was going on with them. Some of these vignettes were better than others.

From Corrigan, a minister to hookers, to Jazzlyn, to Gloria, a housewife who has lost three sons in the war, to Claire, who is also a grieving mother, these characters draw you into their stories, sometimes funny but often heartbreaking.

E nessuno dei personaggi del romanzo dell'irlandese McCann lo è; proprio per questo ognuno di loro con la propria storia e il proprio carico di dolore appare autentico in modo imbarazzante. Ci vuole maestria nel creare un intreccio narrativo così convincente e nel regalare ad ogni personaggio una voce e uno stile narrativo unici. E ci vuole un meraviglioso intuito poetico nell'utilizzare come file rouge che lega le 12 storie la ""passeggiata"" del funambolo Philippe Petit che il 7 agosto del 1974, a 25 anni, attraversò più volte su un cavo d'acciaio lo spazio vuoto tra le Torri Gemelle. E sullo sfondo una New York sempre presente. Descritta con una sensibilità tale da far dire a Frank McCourt: “Nessuno scrittore ha mai raccontato New York in modo tanto sublime e profondo”. Non mancano i riferimenti storici alla Guerra del Vietnam e a Nixon. Alcune storie funzionano inevitabilmente più di altre (la mia preferita è ""Con tutto il rispetto per il Cielo, a me piace quaggiù"") ma nel complesso è un romanzo eccellente, scritto con cuore e cervello. Peccato per la scelta dell'editore italiano di non tradurre in modo più letterale il titolo originale ""Let the Great World Spin"" (""Let the great world spin forever down the ringing grooves of change"", tratto da una poesia di Alfred Tennyson). "
169,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17629329-leah,Rating 5 out of 5,"Moments...One August morning in 1974, a man was spotted standing on top of one of the newly-built Twin Towers. A crowd quickly gathered, wondering if he was going to jump. Some prayed for his safety and begged him to come down, others egged him on to jump, in that ugly way crowds have. But in a moment of unforgettable magic, Philippe Petit stepped out onto an inch-thick wire, 1350 feet above the ground, and walked between the towers. For 45 minutes he held the city enthralled as he walked back and forth, sitting, even lying on the wire.When something as momentous as 9/11 happens, how do you deal with it in fiction? To tell the story of the events themselves can feel maudlin, voyeuristic – a kind of cashing-in on tragedy. Colum McCann's book only obliquely refers to that day, but the iconic status of the Twin Towers, their presence in the book, means it's never far from the reader's mind. And it's no coincidence that the one picture McCann has chosen to illustrate the book, with the benefit of hindsight becomes terrifyingly prescient.Instead, McCann chooses a different unique moment in the history of the Twin Towers, using it as a starting point to tell the stories of some of the people whose lives intersected while Petit walked. It's not a celebration of New York, exactly – it's too clear-sighted about the many problems that existed at a point when the city was drowning in drugs and crime, and the country was reeling from Vietnam. But it is a deeply affectionate picture, a warts and all portrait of its people struggling to achieve that point of balance, to make their own walk, to recognise the occasional moment of magic in their own lives.In the end I loved the book, but it took a while for me to get there. Rather appropriately, it was almost exactly at the mid-point that I suddenly became invested in the lives McCann describes. I suspect this is one of those books that will actually work better on a re-read, because knowing how the stories play out will add the emotional content to the early chapters which I felt was a little lacking on a first read. Although I grew to love it, I can't in truth say the book is unflawed. Some of the chapters are little more than long streams of foul-mouthed, unimaginative swearing, either in dialogue or when he's writing some characters' narratives in first person. An author should do more than pick up speech traits – mimicry is not art. Being brutal about it, one can train a parrot to repeat speech. But in fiction, an author should be able to achieve a sense of authenticity without simply parroting the poor language skills of the people on whom he's basing his characters.It's a pity because, when he ceases the mimicry and writes in his own creative voice, he writes quite beautifully. The sections where he describes Petit's preparation and walk create such brilliant atmosphere that I felt all the terror and exhilaration as if I were there on top of the Tower with him. His characterisation is superb – these people gradually became real to me so that I cared what happened to them. And he avoids any emotional trickery or contrived coincidence, so that their stories feel as real as their personalities.The other major flaw is that some of the sections don't add anything and, in fact, serve only to break the flow and interrupt the development of an emotional bond between reader and characters. Some of the threads carry through the book, recurring and twining around each other, like an intricate dance. But a few of them are entirely separate – for example, the section about the boy who photographs graffiti on the underground, or the hackers who – well, I can't really tell you what the hackers do, because it was so full of unnecessary techie jargon that almost the only words I understood were the incessant swear words, and I tired of them so thoroughly I skipped the bulk of that chapter in the end. I guess McCann was trying to cover everything he could think of that was relevant to New York or the time, but I felt the book would have been tighter and more effective if it had stayed more focused.Despite all this, the major stories have a depth and fundamental truth to them that in the end lifts the book to within touching distance of greatness. Corr, the religious brother working amongst New York's prostitutes and drug dealers, is caught between his vow of celibacy and his love for a woman. Tillie tells her own story of her life as a prostitute and her shame as she sees her beloved daughter Jazzlyn follow her onto the streets. Claire is mourning the son she lost in Vietnam and trying to find a kind of solace in the company of other bereaved mothers. Gloria, whose life would have broken many women, finding a way to survive by holding out a generous hand to those around her. Solomon, the judge who spends his days brokering deals and plea bargains, suddenly tasked to find an appropriate punishment for this man who has committed trespass to walk between the Towers, and in doing so has caused a whole city to raise its eyes. As they cross each other's paths, McCann shows how single moments can change entire lives, and ripple out to touch the lives of others.McCann paints New York as a city that lived for the moment, instantly forgetting its own history – a place without the memorials and statues that fill other great capitals of the world. And he leaves the reader to realise how that all changed when the Twin Towers fell – their absence a memorial that will exist as long as anyone remembers seeing them soar above the city skyline, and will have a half-life in photos, newsreels, art and literature for long after that. But as his characters walk their own wires and the great world spins, ultimately he reminds us that some moments bring magic and wonder rather than tragedy, and hope exists even at the darkest times. 4 ½ stars for me, so rounded up.www.fictionfanblog.wordpress.com"

It's actually a series of inter-connected short stories that center around the tightrope walk by Philippe Petit between the World Trade Center towers in August of 1974. It's really about the city itself, and the wide variety of characters that live there. Such great writing and such vivid characters. Recommended."
172,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7313668-lia,Rating 4 out of 5,"Having lived some years in New York, I felt and enjoyed the vibe of various city neighborhoods that the author describes with artistry. The Big Apple is one of the many characters of the book who are as diverse as the city itself. I found there was a parallel between the balance of the man walking a tightrope between the twin towers and the city trying to find an equilibrium and merge its different elements into a whole. At the beginning, we read different stories but there is a connection among the characters which is surprising and moving at the same time. Some descriptions were lengthy but colorful at the same time. Finally, despite the sadness and heartbreaking events, there is something promising about the eternal forward movement of the world. And it is about the essence of human relationships. It’s not only about truth but about honesty as well. McCann removes the masks from the faces of his characters. We see them at their worst and at their best. "

Wow! I loved this book SO much. Massive crush on Corrigan. Tilly’s section was my favorite, I think. Going on my GOATed list with Middlesex and Kavalier & Clay, so clearly the niche is real. It’s so wild to spend pages and pages (or in my case hours since I listened to it) in one person’s life and then find that same person vaguely alluded to as a total extra in another person’s life. It’s like… real life or something!!!"

McCann is such a talented writer, his handling of each of these different storyline is magical. How he finds grace and hope in grief and the mundane, and keeps the reader totally immersed is out of this world. This is a great piece of work. I'm totally rereading this again. And again.

I will finish this thru-hike. I have too much love for the trail to give it up now. if I had to describe the AT in a phrase it would be that it's a ""meditation on pain.""albeit overhyped, this book was good. what follows are nonlinear vignettes of different characters whose lives are tangled together without any of them knowing it. I find myself feeling meh about stories that divide up the book into chapters centering on different characters. it's too many POV's without enough depth to connect. I LOVE a good character and I always feel let down with this structure. I never feel like I get to know who each person is before we move onto the next. that's more a pet peeve than anything the author did wrong. in fact, I found his writing to be very strong, despite it feeling overedited at times. near the end, I was ready to move on and start something new since I wasn't totally enthralled.

He portrays both the grittiness and glossiness of these different characters that are scattered across the city. The occasional memories that they share about their family history (Corrigan and Ciaran’s childhood in Ireland, Gloria’s in MO, etc) add great depth. The story of the star performer- the tightrope walker- perfectly blended in and while not overshadowing the other characters. Quite simply a wonderfully written novel that I’d love to read again. "

182,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2442580-frank,Rating 4 out of 5,"I was a seventeen-year old boy, working in my first ""real"" job the summer of 1974, between high school graduation and college. I worked in the mail room of a large engineering company located at 2 Rector Street, right behind Trinity Church, and every morning my dad and I would take the PATH train over from Jersey City to lower Manhattan. The station is in the basement of the World Trade Center. And one morning as we came out onto the street, everyone—in very uncharacteristic fashion, for this is New York City—was looking up. Up into the sky, where there was what appeared to be a man on a wire between the two towers.It hit so many right notes for me. I don't know if McCann was really any good at descriptions—at least of place—because I knew almost all of the places he described. From the Sandycove Strand in Dublin to public housing projects under the Major Deegan in the South Bronx. And of course the World Trade Center. But he is without doubt brilliant at creating voices. Each part of the book is told by a different character (or by an omniscient narrator), from a different point in time. The opening and longest section describes the life and work of John A. ""Corrie"" Corrigan, as told by his older brother, Ciaran. Corrigan is a brother in some unnamed Catholic order and was sent to New York to live and work among the poor, just doing ""good deeds"", proselytizing by example; living a simple, Spartan, Franciscan life among the prostitutes and pushers of the South Bronx. His relationship with his ""flock"" (a word neither he nor they would consider using), the lives he touched in his brief time in New York, is one of the main threads that runs throughout the book.Another important character is Clair Soderberg, who we would once have called a Park Avenue matron (does the ""type"" still exist?). The wife of a municipal court judge, she grieves for the loss of her only child, killed in the dying days of the Vietnam War. She too is touched by Corrigan's life and work, though casually, without knowing it. Others who get their moment are Tilly Henderson, one of the prostitutes; Lara, an artist and Village bohemian; a young would-be tagger and budding photojournalist; a group of geeks somewhere in California in the process of inventing the Internet; Gloria, a friend of Clair and resident of the projects; Clair's husband, Judge Soderburg; and Jaslyn Henderson, Tilly's granddaughter, speaking from 2006 and pulling together the various threads.But of course the overarching character, who touched all the lives above and so many more (mine included) is the one real-life person in the novel: Philippe Petit, the man who walked along a wire strung a quarter-mile above the world between the towers of the World Trade Center, 7 August 1974. Now, more than thirty-five years later, it's difficult to remember what I remember of that morning, as opposed to what I've seen and read in all the many intervening years.There were just a few missteps, perhaps all the more glaring because they were so few. For one, I doubted the veracity of Corrigan's brother referring to him as ""Corrigan""—which of course was his own last name. Within families, childhood names stick. Also, when Lara collects Corrigan's personal effects, she looks in his wallet to find his address and makes some comment about the photo on his driver's license: ""I stared at the license. He looked younger than my freeze-frame memory had made him. A pair of oddly frightened eyes, looking way beyond the camera."" We didn't have photos on driving licenses back in the early '70s.But these are quibbles. It was a wonderful story, wonderfully told."

184,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/103435812-reshmita-nayudu,Rating 4 out of 5,"“The thing about love is that we come alive in bodies not our own” (175). let the great world spin is a novel that i never would have thought i liked. not in a million years. this is not the genre i usually read, nor a well known author (at least in our time) or a cover that screams for me to pick it up. however, i think this was a brilliantly written novel by Colum McCann. i have so many thoughts and so many ideas, but really, as i said in this class, the central idea of this novel is to let the great world spin. we're offered so many stories, from so many different people, all who are struggling through the monumental mess of grief. what does one do when confronted with grief? we're offered this answer throughout the novel. grief, somehow makes the world smaller. grief connects people through the most twisted pathways, yet the characters are able to find solace. these new connections, along with the tightrope walker (shoutout to filip petit), shows that the world keeps moving on no matter what has changed. grief and its impermanence is beautiful in a sense. how else can we find the courage to move on if grief was the sole thing that defined us for the rest of our lives? the answer is that we cannot. nothing is ever simple here, and nothing is every so simple in real life. McCann rewrites our categorization of people, changing the way we see everyone.“I sit there thinking about how much courage it takes to live an ordinary life” (56)."
185,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48262256-luna-claire,Rating 5 out of 5,"Open this book anywhere – and read. The beauty of the prose cannot be surpassed. The eloquence isn’t found in the landscape, or a sunset. It is the characters that have a profound luster, the quality of timelessness. “There are moments we return to, now and always. Family is like water—it has memory of what it once filled, always trying to get back to the original stream.”It sounds like a cliché to say, we are all related. But this book makes it as clear as Faulkner and Joyce. The depth of characters that are a deep dive into the soul of humanity. The Jesuit who appears to stray but is more truthful in his ministry. The prostitutes whose love is more sincere. “I’ve got a voice, too, with an undertow, so people look at me and think that I’m about to break into some old cane-field spiritual, but the truth is I haven’t seen God since those early days when I left Missouri and I’d rather go home to my room in the Bronx and pull the bedsheets high and listen to Vivaldi slide through the stereo speakers than listen to any preacher ranting on about how to save the world.” Yes, there is a collision—literal and metaphorical. But more than a collision of cultures there is connection which takes this out of the 70’s and 80’s depravity we have read before. In this story, there is a connection between characters that transcends country, time, race, status, and age. Many good writers might attempt to paint this imagery, but McCann is brilliant in his execution. Vibrant and alive, it is a silk thread woven through by a master. “a clock sounds. Little else to distract attention from the evening, just a clock, in a time not too distant from the present time, yet a time not to distant from the past, the unaccountable unfolding of consequence into tomorrow’s time, the simple things, the grain of bedwood alive in light, the slight argument of dark still left in the old woman’s hair, the ray of moisture on the plastic lifebag, the curl of the braided flower petal, the chipped edge of a photo frame, the rim of a mug, the mark of a stray tea line along its edge, a crossword puzzle sitting unfinished, the yellow of a pencil dangling over the edge of the table, one end sharpened, the eraser in midair. Fragments of a human order. Jaslyn turns the pencil around to safety…” In my mind, I have added an exclamation point at my awe of the beauty on this page. Here is the rest:“She parts the curtain a little more, opens the triangle, lifts the window frame minutely, feels the curl of breeze on her skin: the dust, the light now pressing the dark out of things. We stumble on, now, we drain the light from the dark, to make it last. She lifts the window higher.”And then the raison d'être:“We stumble on, thinks Jaslyn, bring a little noise into the silence, find in others the ongoing of ourselves. It is almost enough.” Life is precious. The man who showed the world his bravely walked between the towers. Though the towers have fallen, literally and metaphorically, we and those who follow will carry on."

That's fact. Colum McCann has constructed a wonderful fiction around it which encompasses the lives of some of those who saw or became aware of Petit's feat. They include an Irish priest doing work in the Bronx, a loose group of grieving mothers of Vietnam KIAs who meet that morning within sight of the towers, the judge who handles Petit's court case later in the day, an artist, and more, all connected to each other in some way by the incredible balancing act 110 stories above New York City. These are ordinary people hammered by life. Corrigan the Irish priest struggles to do what he can for Bronx prostitutes and for the patients at an old-age home while at the same time being torn between his vows and his love for a young nurse. The Vietnam survivor mothers are steeped in grief for their sons. The artist and her husband have crashed at the bottom of a drug-induced skid. McCann explains what Petit is to these and other characters in a sentence near the end of the novel: ""....the man alone against scale, still capable of myth in the face of all other evidence."" That moment when Petit walked and danced on that narrow cable strung between the 2 towers becomes the redemptive moment linking these characters to each other and to that irresistible inspiration above them. Aware of the incredible tightrope walk, the characters are unaware that in little ways they emulate him. A walk one character takes through the dangerous streets of the Bronx is compared to Petit's walk. A kid walking the beams of a bridge to spray paint graffiti parallels Petit high above. Jaslyn spreads her arms wide to maintain her balance on a curb. Corrigan the priest thinks of himself as an acrobat walking the thin line between his vows and his love for a woman.Philippe Petit has shown the way. Near the middle of the novel he imagines his caper as a kind of spark bringing life to the sterility of the silent air between the towers. It's anti-death. And on the last page a young woman driven to deliberations of the past by the grave illness of a nurturing woman who helped raise her realizes it's what we do, we stumble on to bring noise into the silence.McCann has confidently danced across a tightrope himself, keeping his cross section of New Yorkers delicately balanced within the structure of this beautiful and powerful novel. Even the opening will take your breath away. Called ""Those Who Saw Him Hushed,"" this 5-page prelude is as finely written as poetry and the strongest opening to a novel I've experienced since Don DeLillo's opening chapter of Underworld."

Manau, taip atsitiko dėl keleto aspektų:- aprašomų veikėjų. Jų, kaip jau supratote, yra 11 ir visi išties skirtingi. Vieni mane labai sudomino, privertė susimąstyti, kiti - nepaliko jokio įspūdžio. Tad, jei nuoširdžiai, nors knygą perskaičiau ką tik, galėčiau įvardinti 6 veikėjus. Kitų tiesiog neprisimenu. Galvoju, gal pernelyg pretenzinga buvo skaitytoją apkrauti tokia veikėjų gausa? Kita vertus, knygai įpusėjus daug kas stoja ""į vietas"" ir jei pradžioje susieti herojus tarpusavy buvo sunku, vėliau viskas paaiškėja. Čia toks tarsi prizas kantriam skaitytojui, momentas, kai gali sakyti: ""ahaa, tai va kaip čia"", bet ar tai atperka minutes, kuomet žvilgčiojau, kiek vieno ar kito veikėjo aprašymui dar liko puslapių, nesu tikra. - autoriaus rašymo stiliaus. Mano skoniui jis pasirodė šiek tiek per padrikas. Tarsi norima sukurti lengvumo įspūdį, tačiau iš to lengvumo net per sunku buvo. Teko ne kartą pradėti skaityti pastraipą iš naujo, nes tiesiog visiškai nesuprasdavau, ką ja norima pasakyti, o galiausiai suvokdavau, kad nieko nenorima pasakyti, o tiesiog kuriamas veikėjo charakteris. Tačiau, kas tikrai patiko, tai kai kurios mintys, metaforos, išminties perliukai, kurių dėka stabtelėdavau ir pamąstydavau apie tam tikrus gyvenimo niuansus. Pavyzdžiui, ""...kartais šiame gyvenime yra daugiau grožio, nei pasaulis gali ištverti."" - kūrinio stiliaus. Tai alegorinė knyga, ji nėra paprastas romanas, tinkamas paprastam, jaukiam vakarui. O aš tikėjausi būtent to, todėl teko nusivilti. Šiam kūriniui reikia susikaupti, norint pastebėti visus slaptus palyginimus, reikia skaityti plačiai atmerktom akim. Tuomet akylas skaitytojas įžvelgs gilių prasmių ir bus maloniai nustebintas. Deja, šiuo metu nesu tokia skaitytoja, man dabar toks etapas, kuomet iš knygų noriu kažko, ko nereiktų jaukintis, noriu istorijų, kurios tiesiog ""liptų"". Įdomiausia knygoje buvo kai kurių veikėjų likimai, nuobodžiausia - momentai, kuomet buvo rašoma apie lyno akrobatą. Nors istorija su akrobatu - tikra, o visa kita - išgalvota, visgi juntama, jog knygoje mažai dėmesio buvo skiriama akrobatui ir daugiau - lyno, kaip metaforos vaizdiniui. Tačiau galvoju, jog tai buvo daroma sąmoningai. Prieš skaitant šią knygą rekomenduoju susipažinti su autoriumi, ir perskaityti jo interviu.

188,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/355739-the-flooze,Rating 4 out of 5,"Let the Great World Spin is a novel that takes time. Time to read, time to absorb, and time to make decisions about. McCann’s work is filled with poignant lines that you want to scribble down on a piece of paper and thrust in some drawer so that one day you might come upon them again and say “Yes, that’s it. He got that exactly right.”In 1974, a tightrope walker made an insane yet impressive journey along a wire stretched between the towers of the WTC. This remarkable event serves as McCann’s jumping point--a moment that links a host of people across the city, not just those who stood on the streets below, ignoring their responsibilities to watch in awe. The characters we meet come from various backgrounds and lifestyles. On the surface, they seem to have little in common. Along the way, however, it becomes clear that each of them struggles with life, they all try their best, they all suffer for their failures. God is mentioned several times throughout, both as a guiding force and as someone in dire need of an ass-kicking. The most common feeling they share is one of sliding. Sliding through life, letting things go, shrugging things off, trying to fit into the lives they’ve created for themselves. The Irish immigrants, the It girl, the hookers on the stroll, the woman from Park Avenue and many more--they all share a desperation to deal with the facts of their present. They’ve all suffered loss and it’s caused them to live in a world that slides on by while they linger on thoughts of how they got to this point and how they can muster up the oomph to carry on.The tightrope walker serves as a stark contrast. He is free. He lives for this moment where he feels the air above and below, where he can dare to do the impossible and make it his own. He recreates himself through his walks. He isn’t, as one character thinks, making a mockery of death. Instead he is celebrating life and all that’s made possible through sheer perseverance. It took me ages to get through this book. It’s dense. There are connections to be made and layers to peel away. There are moments that resonate and others I can’t relate to at all. But it was thought-provoking and often felt like a puzzle to be unraveled: Connect the dots, who knows whom, compare and contrast and find the commonality that links all these disparate creatures, ponder their lives and contemplate what would have made them whole. I’m sure there’s a lesson or three to be gleaned from these lives, from McCann’s lovely prose and the naked discussion of failure. At the end though, it all comes down to this: “The world spins. We stumble on. It is enough.”"
189,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5137040-sajda,Rating 5 out of 5,"Simply put, this is a beauty of a book. When I first started reading it, I was a bit overwhelmed--too many characters, places and situations for me to keep track of. The book tends to jump from place to place, which can be a bit jarring for any reader. However, the author cleverly weaves all of the stories and characters together in the end. The stories are little moments of life really; fragments of beauty sewn together to create a masterpiece. The language and style used is simple but heavy--every word is there for a reason and there is meaning behind even the most plain of sentences. Here are some of my favorite quotes:What Corrigan wanted was a fully believable God, one you could find in the grime of everyday. The comfort he got from the hard, cold truth--the filth, the war, the poverty--was the life could be capable of small beauties. He wasn't interested in the glorious tales of the afterlife or the notions of a honey-soaked heaven. To him that was a dressing room for hell. Rather he consoled himself with the fact that, in the real world, when he looked closely into the darkness he might find the presence of a light, damaged and bruised, but a little light all the same. He wanted, quite simply, for the world to be a better place, and he was in the habit of hoping for it. Out of that came some sort of triumph that went beyond theological proof, a cause for optimism against all evidence. New York kept going forward precisely because it didn't give a good goddamn about what it had left behind. It was like the city that Lot left, and it would dissolve it it ever began looking backward over its own shoulder. Two pillars of salt. Long Island and New Jersey.What happens if we make a series of paintings and leave them out in the weather? We allow the present to work on the past. We could do something radical here. Do the formal paintings in the style of the past and have the present destroy them. You let the weather become the imaginative force. The real world works on your art. So you give it a new ending. And then you reinterpret it. Death, the great democracy of them all. The world's oldest complaint. Happens to us all. There is no way to find a word to fit around this feeling. Words resist it. Words give it a pattern it does not own. Words put it in the time. They freeze what cannot be stopped. Try to describe the taste of a peace. Try to describe it. Feel the rush of sweetness.The world spins. We stumble on. It is enough. "
190,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/160319-seth-t,Rating 3 out of 5,"This review is more experimental than most because it's about a book I read four months ago and essentially remember not at all. In the strictest sense, this probably isn't very fair, but in another may more accurately distill the book's ultimate value than a morning-after review would.When I say I essentially have no recollection of Let the Great World Spin (a title so forgettable that I usually end up calling it something like Let That Darned Thing Spin Around or Spinning Spinning the World Down or That Tightrope Book), I'm not exactly being honest. Another great way to begin a review and garner trust. What I mean is that the details are all very fuzzy. Details like character names, arcs, and purposes. I mean I still remember that it's a little bit about Philippe Petit (I looked that up), the WTC funambulist. I also remember that it doesn't follow a single narrative or even tell a single story through multiple narratives. In fact, the book, so far as I recall can only be called a novel in a very loose sense of the term. Loose like basset hound jowls. If at all. More, it functions as a bound collection of interrelated (sometimes only tangentially so) discreet narratives that weave about the event of Petit's walk between the not-even-quite-complete 1974 version of the World Trade Center towers.I took awhile to think about it just now and I remembered that the first of these stories that didn't involve Petit was the one that I found the most worthwhile. It involved this guy Corrigan who is a conflicted monk and ministers to the local prostitute corps through donut feedings and the use of his bathroom. It's told through the narrative of his brother, named Ciaren or Cieron or something similar, and deals with some interesting applied theology, balancing the question of heavenly needs and earthly ones. I remembered thinking it was interesting at the time.There was another chapter about a kid photographer that I thought was pretty cool too. Though I couldn't tell you why.In all, my remnant impression is that Let It All Spin, Joe was competently written, occasionally engaging, a bit scattered, and ultimately hollow. Just to be fair, I glanced through the notes I typed into my Kindle and found this: ""This book is absolutely steeped in its sense of place and time."" I don't remember what caused me to write that, but it must have been good, right?Right?"
191,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/183302-christine-galvin-combet,Rating 4 out of 5,"I'm so glad this was the first pick of the new Goodreads bookclub my friend Jason organized, Read Between the Wines! Almost like a fine wine (not that I've had many - or any), this is fine literature. Fortunately, I've had the pleasure of experiencing it enough to know it when I see it. Initially set in New York in the early 70s, we see through the eyes of an unlikely cast of characters - an Irish monk, an Upper West Side mother who lost her son in Vietnam, a mother-daughter team of hookers, an artist who lost her way, and others. Their separate lives come together through their experiences on a day marked by a single event involving a tightrope walker making a spectacle of himself by walking across the World Trade Center towers. There are many themes at work in this novel, importantly family, love and loss, culture and class, faith, forgiveness. McCann helps us navigate tough situations and questions through his characters with authenticity and precision. We are brought into the lives of those who live, love, and are or have lost. What makes this story so unique is that we move forward in time and continue to learn more about the main characters and their lives through the eyes of their loved ones who are affected by their loss. It is pretty powerful when you think about it.By the end of the book, we can see how the tightrope walker could have been a hugely unifying event of the 70s. Reading this in 2012, I was reminded of how the terrible and tragic 2001 terrorist attack brought people together on an even larger scale. What does this say about the direction in which the world has gone, or spun? McCann reminds us that it isn't all doom and gloom though. There is still beauty all around, even to be discovered in the darkest and dustiest corners of a city that has been tried and tested over time. I try not to give 5 star ratings often, so for now I give it 4, however the depth of this story definitely deserves 5 stars."
192,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2422887-sarah,Rating 3 out of 5,"Meh. There's something here, in that many people are falling or trying to fall or not falling and it's subtly 'about' 9/11, and there are some good, solid moments - but it's rather wooly:We stumble on, thinks Jaslyn, bring a little noise into the silence, find in others the ongoing of ourselves. It is almost enough.If this were a student's text, I would be putting '?unclear' in the margin. I also find it's inventive without purpose, full of odd little images that I don't believe amount to anything. For instance:My head against his shoulder, he laughs as if his laughter wants to travel a good distance, down through my body also.Does that mean anything? Not to me. Maybe I'm missing something. Random images are fine if they have energy (unless it's Bulgakov - random with energy, but still not fine) but this is leaden. Also the unexpected but significant connections between the characters in the various chunks of the story seem contrived rather than coincidental. Most of the characters are intense(ly irritating) but often without justification. One, after tragedy and a life that mostly misses the target (though perhaps not at the end), says that the only thing worth grieving over was that sometimes there was more beauty in this life than the world could bear. Fair enough, but it's pretty meaningless as the narrative skips the part of her life where the beauty likely happened (or where she might have come to some re-evaluation of the previous components).Also, anachronism. Grouchy, ok, maybe the Guatemalan kids could have called him that, though we know him as Oscar really; but Elmo wasn't a character per se in 1972 - definitely not known to me and I was glued to Sesame Street around then.So, sloppy, in my rather testy evaluation. But not without heart."
193,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2071527-tony-daniel,Rating 2 out of 5,"More-or-less interconnected short stories and vignettes set in New York in the early 1970s with the central image of Phillip Petite's tightrope walk between the twin towers of the World Trade Center recurring occasionally. My goodness, won the 2009 National Book Award and got such amazing reviews for such a decidedly mediocre book. Makes you think the author might be tight with a few influential critics and literary establishment types, because the book certainly doesn't warrant such praise. And an award? Maybe for not sucking too hard on dead rats. The stories barely escape being vignettes with only a several-degrees-removed narrator attempting to resolve various plot lines--all extremely unsatisfactory and kind of a cheat on the author's part. Obviously, he didn't want to deal with writing the emotional hard part of his tale. Maybe for the best, for McCann is maudlin and treacly enough as it is, a kind of Pat Conroy with literary pretentions. The Irish brothers are the best drawn of the characters, although their story ends idiotically in mid-arc. The remainder are practically stereotypes from Blacksploitation films, ""Starsky and Hutch"" episodes and ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner."" It's not a terrible story collection (if you throw out the vignettes, which go nowhere), but it's certainly not a great novel--especially since it's not a novel to begin with. I would advise McCann not to attempt to write American characters. He clearly hasn't got the touch."

In the case of Let the Great World Spin, I'm given the synthesis of the two. McCann's words are pretty little flutters against an otherwise rancid backdrop of the Bronx in the summer heat. Moreover, though the story maintains one lip-biting element after another, you get the sense of sincere calm and beauty seen in the world, page after page. He never directly touches on it, but there is a lot of 9-11 wrapped up in this story. You can't have someone tightrope walk the twin towers without giving your audience images of them falling. You can't mention war without thinking of all the young lives lost. McCann doesn't seem to be making personal statements about these things, but rather, seems to simply show they exist, and tries to find a lens by which to make them not hurt so badly.Great read."
195,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1041716-michael,Rating 1 out of 5,"This book interested me as I grew up in the semi-bankrupt, filthy, graffiti-stained ungentrified New York of the 1970s and that is where it's set. McCann draws a loose circle of characters around Phillipe Petit's wire walk between the towers of the World Trade Center. Petit himself is a character and that is the first problem--there is no way this book could capture the drama and beauty of this act as adeptly as the documentary film ""Man on Wire,"" which also pulled off the impossible by triggering nostalgia for the brutish World Trade Center as an architectural paragon. The story starts well and evocatively in Dublin with the tale of two Irish brothers; one an ordinary Joe and the other a self-styled saint who joins a brotherhood and moves to the smoldering projects of the Bronx as a protector of an entire gaggle of Wizened Whores with Hearts of Gold. (Here the reader experiences the first signs of panic.) Along the way we meet a kid obsessed with photographing ""tagged"" infrastructure in obsure, hard to reach places; a group of Ur-hackers; a hit-and-run couple of no-talent conceptual artists; and a whole lot of other folks you care less and less about as the narrative dribbles away. McCann can write beautifully but this one lacks focus. (The chapter in which the prostitute-grandma-junkie spins off several thousand street epigrams might drive you especially insane, or at least to read Colm Toibin instead.)No spoiler alert as I did not quite finish this.

And as so often seems to be the case, I am left, at least at this early stage, to wonder why it has received so many accolades. So far, I find it to be somewhat disjointed and oddly un-affecting. It's less a novel as it is an aggregate of short pieces that are loosely stitched together by the theme of loss and the image of the tightrope walker. I'm only halfway through, so I'm not sure what I'll think in the end, but it's a bad sign when I'm struggling to keep my interest going. Which I am. Final thoughts:I hesitate to say this book was boring, but that's the word that inescapably arises. I think it was mainly due to my own subjective reaction to the structure of the narrative. The many disparate narrative pieces just didn't knit together well, and ultimately left me without a center to hang on to. This may have been McCann's intention, but it just served to prevent me from engaging the characters in any meaningful way. And, in contrast to the many words of praise I read, I thought it was a very indistinct sketch of New York city. I would not recommend it. "
198,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/180438-dan,Rating 4 out of 5,"A great author has the ability to create multiple characters who aren't just archetypes, stereotypes, or one-sided, boring creatures. Colum McCann not only has the ability to rise above the common character but to create people who are so lifelike that you feel like you have met them before and have known them, off and on, for years.This book is great fiction because it seems so real. I can't put a book down when the writing not only puts you into a specific time and place, but puts you into a quasi-memory. The settings and dialogue of the characters creates a new reality that you find it hard to pull yourself away from.Each character exhibits a certain amount of sadness and curiosity that I think most people probably feel on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis, but is incredibly hard to write about. This is where I think great fiction helps us as individuals, to take solace in the fact that we are not alone, and to help us understand how other people feel. Even though we interact with people every day, we know very little about how their minds and emotions work. Fiction gives us small glimpses into how humans operate.Plus, I liked how McCann connected the characters together without going overboard."

201,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4482712-jennifer,Rating 4 out of 5,"This story utilizes as a backdrop the memorable day in 1974 when Philippe Petit walked a tightrope wire between the World Trade Center towers. As the novel unfolds, we learn how ordinary men and women living in NYC were going about their lives during that time, and we also discover how their less than famous journeys hold as much drama and suspense as the actions of the man high above the city sidewalks. The book flows like a great independent movie, where we are introduced to a cast of characters and slowly begin to realize how these individual lives are connected in significant ways. To say much more than that would likely result in spoilers.NYC in the early 1970’s was often a dangerous city and the characters in this story experience some tragic moments. No one emerges unscathed regardless of race, gender or income bracket, but there is always a sense of hope percolating under the surface. Even the most disadvantaged characters find great moments of joy to cling to and this story illustrates just how strong humans can be, even in what they consider to be their weakest states.This is not a carefree read, but it is a captivating story."
202,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Once in awhile you come across a book, that due to some circumstance speaks to you a little louder and clearer than the others. This for me was that book. A novel created from a series of interwoven stories (each chapter depicts another character in the narrative,) it all surrounds the actual tight rope walk between the two towers at the World Trade Center, while the building was being finished in the early 1970s.(One of the first acts of gorilla art in the US.) The writing (as I would expect from any Irishman) was lyrical and really managed to catch both the beauty and the tragedy of the characters lives. The one theme that seemed to resonate through the book is really about how life is a series of events... each in it's own time, and each with consequence which culminates in the genesis of yet another unique event. It is in the strinigng of these events (like the narrative itself with it's different stories surrounding the same event and largely interconnected) that we define our lives, relationships, accomplishments and regrets. I am really looking forward to his next novel, and really feel this was a terrific book."

This novel, Let the Great World Spin, is elegant, poignant, lyrical and so beautifully written. I underlined many, many phrases to remember the way McCann describes ordinary objects or people in the most extraordinary way. I would love (or possibly hate) being a student of his at Hunter College.McCann wraps several personal vignettes around one singular event: Phillipe Petit's 1974 walk between the World Trade Center Towers. With incredibly diverse and imaginative stories, McCann sculpts the lives, in a complicated interlaced network, of people from many different walks of life, and yet the completed novel fits beautifully together ~ like the most delicate and gorgeous puzzle.The novel is long at 349 pages, and it reads very slowly, or at least I read it slowly because I didn't want to miss a single sentence.

In much the same way that Jay McInerney and Don DeLillo have become standard bearers for social commentary in American fiction, McCann writes about particular times and places -- """"the collision point of stories"""" -- with a sharp eye and a genuine empathy that allows his fiction to resound with the power of memoir. In Let the Great World Spin, the lives of his characters mirror Petit's courageous, outrageous walk -- paths set, outcomes less certain. Although widely praised, a few critics commented that the stories-within-this-story were uneven -- not to mention mostly depressing. But in the end, most reviewers opined that the novel's day-in-the-life frame calls to mind James Joyce's Ulysses; the words and the ideas, though, are all McCann's."""

After 1,000 perfectly-wrought metaphors, you never want to see a metaphor again. I feel like I'm wading through an assigned book. Despite all the deaths and heroin and muggings, nothing seems to happen in scene. There's no tension. We're just told how to feel, over and over.

218,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/811952-roy,Rating 4 out of 5,"First thing first about this lovely, bittersweet novel is that I love its title. The author's note at the end explains that it comes from the Alfred, Lord Tennyson poem ""Locksley Hall"" which itself was heavily influenced by Arabic poetry written in the sixth century. It's difficult to give a concise synopsis of Let the Great World Spin because it barely has a plot. It's basically a collection of wonderful short stories, and some of the tales end up meeting at an intersection with one or two of the other tales. Every narrative crosses paths, even if in a slight, superficial way, with at least one of the others. But this is not to say that all of them connect to all of the others. One of the sections is based on a true event, something I also came to learn in the author's notes, so I'm glad I decided not to stop at the last line of the story and instead ventured a bit into the book's backmatter. On August 7, 1974, which was nearly one year to the day after construction of them was completed, a man named Phillippe Petit walked a tightrope wire between the World Trade Center towers. I was unfamiliar with this event until getting to the end of Let the Great World Spin. Colum McCann fictionalizes Philippe Petit for a portion of this novel, but the main story line isn't about the daring tightrope walker. Is isn't about any of the people who witness the incredible event, or learn that it's taking place in their fantastical city of New York, or the judge that the daredevil is brought before after making it safely across the wire and into the arms of police officers, or the judge's wife or the woman she ends up becoming close friends with in spite of their significantly different stations in society. Truth is, no story line in particular takes top billing but instead they share it. The book starts out by introducing us to a man named Ciaran but we learn less about him than we do about his brother Corrigan who I initially assumed would be the book's focus. Corrigan is an interesting character, not quite a priest or monk but basically living a lifestyle that appears to be modeled on the modest one of Christ. Except that while we read in the Bible about only one prominent prostitute whom Christ knew well, Corrigan lives among a bunch of them. His home is a tenement apartment in the Bronx that never has a locked door so that his friends can use it as a place of refuge or a quick bathroom break in between tricks. Eventually their pimp figures out that he is not competition or trying to interfere with the street walking business. Corrigan eventually succumbs to temptation of the flesh, though it isn't a proverbial hooker with a heart of gold that he falls for but a widowed woman named Adelita with two young children. The story abruptly leaves Corrigan when he, along with one of the prostitutes he befriends, is killed in a car accident. The narrative then follows the people behind the wheel of the other car for a while. Later it jumps to a woman named Claire who is in mourning for the death of her son in the Vietnam War. Claire meets at alternating homes with a group of other women who have lost sons to the war. One of them is Gloria who ends up adopting the children of Jazzlyn who is the woman killed alongside Corrigan. Jazslyn's mother Tillie is also a prostitute and eventually takes a turn as the focus of the narrative from a prison cell where she is grateful to know her granddaughters may have a way out that she was never able to provide to her daughter. Towards the end of the book we meet the adult Jaslyn who is one of the two little girls who lost their biological mother in the car accident, and as result escape being the next generation of women in the family to make ends meet as a whore. Two people are in the vehicle that clips Corrigan's van from behind on the highway. They are a married couple, both artists. It is a hit and run crime that effectively ends their marriage. While the husband Blaine wants to move on and act like the tragic event he does not believe was his fault ever took place, Lara is consumed by guilt that compels her to reach out to the people whose lives were upturned. In being drawn to the the victims of the crime, she ends up meeting and subsequently falling in love with and marrying Ciaran. I've touched on most if perhaps not quite all of the people who get a turn on center stage as Colum McCann lets his fine novel veer from character to character. Sadness permeates many of the pages. There is plenty of pain and regret to go around. But as their lives crisscross with one another or fail to do so, there is also hope for the promise of a better day. Life arbitrarily keeps and breaks such promises. It can sometimes feel as perilous as walking across a tightrope stretched taut across the top of skyscrapers, and at other times be as wondrously miraculous a thing as falling into the arms of the person you are meant to be with. McCann patches chapter together in a manner similar to the movie Love Actually. Multiple stories take turns grabbing your attention, every so often a connection of some kind is made between them, but in the end you're left with no one story in particular. And you don't mind one bit because you know that your very own life is not a single tale but a patchwork quilt of happenings and occurrences that compose the entirety of you. Colum McCann is a brilliant writer. I look forward to reading more of his writing at some point in the future. But for now I will leave the world of his magnetic prose behind and haphazardly spin to that of another."

225,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/880021-david-sasaki,Rating 5 out of 5,"The world spins by ever faster, a phenomenon not just of growing older — accumulating our own extensive, personal archive — but also a product of every generation leaving behind more for us to chew on, despite the same amount of time to chew. We mostly survive by keeping our heads down, locking out the rest of the world, isolating ourselves in our earbuds, screens, and living rooms. When Joshua Bell, one of the world's greatest classical musicians, pulled out his Stradivari violin to play for free at a Washington DC metro station, most passerby were incapable of snapping out of their morning daze to stop and pay attention. Extraordinarily few events are truly cathartic, not for a single individual, but genuine collective catharsis. The fall of the Berlin Wall, the freedom of Nelson Mandela, the Cuban Revolution, 9/11. They are events rooted in emotion, they change our worldview, and they seem to actually change the world around us, even as the initial moment of catharsis is inevitably circumscribed by the determined shortcomings of human nature.[image error]Colum McCann has written elsewhere that he set out to write a book about 9/11. An Irish emigre, living in New York and teaching at Hunter College, he experienced firsthand how the day changed New York City. His father-in-law was among the lucky ones who escaped from the second tower before it crumbled to ground zero. But those memories, those images, were still too raw, too recent, to view through the looking glass of a novelist. He needed an allegory, which he found even before 9/11, tucked away in Paul Auster's 1992 
The Red Notebook
. The 100-page collection of stories mentions Philippe Petit, a 61-year-old mischievous Frenchman who on August 7, 1974 walked a tightrope from one Twin Tower to the other. Writes McCann:Shortly after 9/11 everything in Manhattan seemed to have intimate meaning ... A car on 85th Street sat collecting parking tickets at first, but they soon became flowers: On the dashboard was a fireman's parking permit ... Somehow each thing was linked with the next and the last.The question, as a writer, was how to find meaning at all when there was, in plain sight, a world charged with meaning ...The tightrope walk was an act of creation that seemed to stand in direct defiance to the act of destruction twenty-seven years later.[image error]Philippe Petit walking on a metal cable between the Twin Towers as an airplane passes overhead. Photograph by Vic DeLuca, 1974.McCann immediately began researching New York City circa 1974 and the novel is a testament to his due diligence, but it doesn't get bogged down by historical trivia. As McCann continued his research, the famous high-wire walk became much more visible to my generation. Petit himself published an autobiographical account in 2002, which was then turned into a stunning 2008 documentary (available via streaming on Netflix).

But wait, that's not what this novel is about at all. Rather, Petit's daring walk becomes an anchor, a single event with which to examine a single year in a single city from multiple perspectives as lives criss and cross with little consideration of all that leads to our every interaction. This is what makes McCann's writing breathtaking. It takes one hell of a ballsy novelist to have a go at narrating from the first-hand perspective of a neurotic Park Avenue housewife, a late-career prostitute in the Bronx, a burned out city judge, a Guatemalan nurse. But he does all of this and much more with seemingly little effort. And from the lives of the characters we begin to piece together some of the emerging trends of 1974: the soldiers back from Vietnam and desperate for sex and drugs, the creeping understanding of the eventual impact of ARPANET, the epidemic of housing fires in the South Bronx, the boom of liberation theology.This book has been sitting on my bookshelf for nearly two years now. I'm not sure what inspired me to finally pick it up this month, but it made for fortuitous companionship. When a character narrated her experience on 53rd and Lexington, there I was, at a hotel just two blocks away. When another character was mugged in Harlem near 5th avenue and 120th Street, I was once again just a few blocks away, reading myself to sleep at a friend's apartment. New York City today is so different from the New York of 1974 that it was at times difficult to believe McCann's portrayal. And yet I know that his descriptions are grounded in impeccable research, that the city really has changed so radically in such short time (even if today's subway rats are the very descendants of their 1974 forefathers).It is difficult to compare 1974 with today and not come away with some sense of optimism. The world — or at least New York City — has become a more tolerant, more respectful, safer place to live. I traveled to New York, in part, to see if I could ever live there. I gave myself a full seven days; from SoHo to Harlem, Newark to Brooklyn, all the way over to Long Island. I wanted to consume and digest the entire city, to let it envelope me, to make it my own, to see it from the eyes of a resident. But quickly I realized that I came with a fundamentally flawed strategy. New York City is too much of an experience for any one person to understand. Residents quickly learn to break it down into its comfortable, component parts. ""You can't treat New York City as a single entity,"" one friend tells me as I complain about sensory overload and exhaustion. ""I've got my weekly dinner friends and my community garden ... you know, you learn to find your spaces, your routine."" And by necessity, you begin to shut the rest out, turn your senses off, hide in your iPod, magazine, and private world of private thoughts.Literature is still a wonderful trick to break down those component parts we all create and tie it all together again. ""One of the points of this novel,"" writes fellow Hunter College professor Nathan Englander, ""is that, no matter how many worlds New York contains within it, it's really a wonderful, singular, unified city."" McCann begins the novel with a quote from Aleksandar Hemon: ""All the lives we could live, all the people we will never know, never will be, they are everywhere. That is what the world is.""The concern, of course, is that literature becomes our escapism, our excuse to see individuals and communities unlike our own without ever actually interacting with them. That literature becomes an isolated end in itself rather than an inspirational beginning to a fuller, more satisfactory life. I have recently begun reading three ""anti-armchair"" guides to Mexico City that set out to inspire readers to cross their ordinary social boundaries. All three, beautifully designed guides are available in their entirety online. They are a starting point for me to piece together my own urban tapestry, even if I could never reach the eloquence and ambition of McCann."
226,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1627591-robert,Rating 4 out of 5,"I give this novel a high mark because it is so vivid, written with a great sense of pace and specificity. In a way, it is a tour de force, and in a way, being a tour de force limits it. Let me explain. Here we have a series of stories in which a character from one episode is central to another episode. Their connections are sometimes fraternal, sometimes through being neighbors, sometimes by pure accident or an answered ad in a newspaper. The setting is New York. The Trade Towers still stand. A man is going to cross the distance between them on a high wire. That's one episode (which is returned to). Among those watching him in awe is a judge, who hopes he will catch the case when the aerialist is brought before the law. The judge's wife meets with a group of mothers who lost sons in Vietnam. One of the mothers raises the daughter of a prostitute who dies in a car crash. The prostitute had been looked after by a kind of Catholic friar, who is Irish. He dies in the car crash, too. His brother, visiting from Ireland, participates in the prostitute's burial. While there he spots a woman who was in the car that caused the car crash. And so on...The writing is great, as I say. You won't want to skip this one if you haven't already read it, but I did find that no one is fully developed in the sense that each person is gone before a reader--this reader--has time to care,. Beyond that, McCann is philosophically attuned to the world ""spinning,"" as in going on and on despite a tragedy, a missed opportunity, a death. This has to do with the novel giving up one character as another character takes stage. There is almost a ""so it goes"" quality to the appearance of the next man or woman up, and the same thing pertains to elements within a single character study. One older prostitute has been beaten badly many times; this is reported; but there is no inquiry into her psychic scars. The reader--this reader--sees her from a middle distance, not close up.So this urban kaleidoscope tricks us into accepting a story full of coincidences that ultimately doesn't add up to much beyond the fact that coincidences are always happening in places like New York. I enjoyed the book, but tour de force works of art often sacrifice meaning for method. In my case, I ended up dazzled but disappointed.A novel to which Let the Great World Spin is sometimes compared is Bonfire of The Vanities by Tom Wolfe. I haven't read it in a long time, but my recollection is that the Wolfe novel has more bite. Greed is greed, shame is shame, vanity is vanity, factors in existence we can't spin away from because we brought them on ourselves and we have to live with them. "

228,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book is unique. It is a beautifully written narrative that is researched such that it has elements of documentary. A narrative documentary, so to speak. Let The Great World Spin takes an intense and unveiled plunge into New York. It does not shy away from its darker sides, rather it keeps searching to find the little bit of light in every moment, person, disaster. There is a heavy romantic influence which has been shifted in a post industrial era. I have always been fascinated by the shift in art Bruegel employed in Peasant’s Wedding and Hunter’s in the Snow. He was among the first to paint the commonplace, the ordinary, naming it worthy of being painted. Though it may seem contradictory, I believe the romantics carry on this sentiment with their mystic simplicity and pursuit of Nature. In the industrial era the ordinary that was often forgotten in were trees, mountains, and snowy passes. Now after all this, in New York in the latter 1900s, there is a shell shocked world that has settled and often been buried in the dust of the Industrial Revolution. The commonplace has become everyday relationships, traffic, dirty streets, suffering and pain and light intermingled amidst it all. This is a book that continues this conversation, it paints the ordinary that we never look at. The stories we see everyday but never recognize, never give a passing glance. The stories we avert our eyes from. It steps in amongst them, it gives them the value of being worth a painting, a poem, a novel and in return they teach us a little bit about the world, the pain it bears and the beautiful sorrow it endures. It misses some things, namely the beauty of repentance as it sings a tale much like Blake’s songs of innocence. But it captures much that we ought not to pass by."
229,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/98912411-lynsi-nauman,Rating 5 out of 5,"I thought this was exceptional. The complexity and connections of the characters lives and the premise of the happenings of New York City in 1974 made me think that the author had some big JK Rowling grand plan for the book. I was surprised to read in the author’s note, (which also was exceptional), that the writing of the book happened to him, rather than him happening to the book. The following was from the Q&A at the end of the book:“It’s strange, but as I grow older, I find myself developing more optimism. I keep inching toward the point where I believe that it’s more difficult to have hope that it is to embrace cynicism. In the deep, dark end, there’s no point unless we have at least a modicum of hope. We trawl our way through the darkness, hoping to find a pinpoint of light. But isn’t it remarkable that the cynics of the world-the politicians, the corporations the squinty eyed critics- seem to think that they have a claim on intelligence? They seem to think that it’s cooler, more intellectually engaging, to be miserable, but that there is some sort of moral heft in cynicism. But I think a good novel can be a doorstop to despair. I also think the real bravery comes with those who are prepared to go through that door, and look at the world, and all its crime and torment, and still find something of value, no matter how small.” "

The entire story is so vivid that I found myself slowing down just to let the pictures created paint themselves like magic. Also, I love short stories, and the ways these stories wove together were masterful—it felt unforced. Somehow every character became more and more important and alive in the process. And it was so satisfying to understand how the timelines worked together and how different storylines connected. The only parts of the book I didn't like or understand or even enjoy were the graffiti artist appreciator and the hackers ringing phone booths to hear about the tightrope walker—I couldn't figure out in the end who any of those characters were, and it felt like every other scene mattered to create the full story except those two. Otherwise, really beautiful and worth reading."

Each character and storyline feels so unique in tone yet similar in the thread of humanity. This book felt like a work of art in the sense that each and every word was delicately and purposefully placed in a way that makes the final product feel so special. Everything had purpose! Some of the brilliance of this book is how each story is written differently. The writing lends to the mental state of the character in such an enveloping way. While beautifully written, I ultimately struggled to get through this book—it was just a lot! It had no big driving force so reading it felt like reading 12 small books. I read another review that says this book “rewards patient readers” and that could not be more true. "
232,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8507864-remy,Rating 5 out of 5,"Colum McCann's uncanny (see what I did there?) ability to write a novel with short story sensibilities really shines through in Let The Great World Spin. It's deeper and darker than Transatlantic, and at times he lacks sympathy for certain characters, but the way he writes is always a real treat, with pearls of quotable brilliance, impeccably crafted prose, and a very thoughtful, raw, and yet elegant story. The 'all eyes on the World Trade Center' approach is such a unique and delicate tribute to 9-11, and I haven't encountered another author to handle a tribute like this with level of honest emotion and also tenderness. This is another solid, exceptional story from Colum McCann"

Enquanto no filme abordam-se diferentes estereótipos da sociedade para explorar um clima de tensão racial, o livro a meu ver deixa a desejar justamente no que deveria ser melhor.As histórias são boas, os personagens são bastante peculiares, mas pra mim faltou algo mais. Simplesmente não basta que todos os eventos gravitem em torno do equilibrista que cruzou as Torres Gêmeas andando sobre um cabo de aço...os personagens deveriam despertar maior curiosidade e envolvimento, e algumas histórias poderiam ser mais interessantes. Aproveitando esse ponto comum, talvez a abordagem ganhasse mais fôlego se a cada história um diferente ponto de vista fosse colocado sobre um mesmo personagem e/ou evento, criando uma dúvida sobre a versão dos fatos que se acabara de apresentar."

246,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9414633-julie,Rating 5 out of 5," Parts of a Whole	A very complex and intriguing novel, Colum McCann’s Let The Great World Spin is one filled with very dynamic characters that are all in search of their own version of the truth. Each of these characters shares many of the things they are in search of but they are unique in their approach on achieving that goal. They are looking to their past and worried about what their future may hold for them, searching for answers and clarity and wanting to know where exactly they fit into this great big world that is spinning. 	The most salient idea in McCann’s novel is the idea of connection. We see throughout his novel that his characters are interconnected by a singular theme. They are searching for where and what their place in the world and how it fits into the bigger picture. McCann’s use of metaphysics in the novel is so well placed and used throughout the novel, it helps us as readers to understand what the characters are going through and gives us a broader sense of what they are searching for. Judge Soderberg is one of these characters and he finally comes to the realization that he has been a part of a system that he has been trying to avoid, but now realizes there was no way to escape it. McCann says “ He refused to believe them for many months, but slowly it dawned on him that they were correct – he was caught, he was part of the system, and the word was appropriate, a part of the Parts” (256). Judge Soderberg is coming to grips that not only is he a part of the system but that we all have a part to play in society; we all have a role to play. It does not seem that way on a small scale, but we are a piece of the puzzle to be completed. 	And yet a more ambiguous suggestion in this novel is McCann’s communication regarding the tightrope walker and how he fits into the scheme of things. The novel starts off with him being the main focal point, and we get snippets of information about him throughout the novel, but the reader does not really understand what connection exactly he has with the rest of the characters Is he a metaphor for what the characters in the story are searching for? Is he an actual character that they encounter, and connect with him that way? My sense is that he is a metaphor of what the characters are searching for. He is different from the rest of the characters; he seems to know who he is and what he wants. The tightrope walker is whole while the other characters are broken. McCann illustrates, “Within seconds he was pureness moving and he could do anything he liked. He was inside and outside his body at the same time, indulging in what it meant to belong to the air, no future no past, and this gave him the offhand vaunt to his walk. He was carrying his life from one side to the other. On the lookout for the moment when he wasn’t even aware of his breath” (164). The tightrope walker has a peace within him especially when he is on the tightrope. He lives for the moment not thinking about the past and not worrying about what tomorrow brings; he is living for the moment right then and there. This is the place within all of us that is hard to find and once we find it, it is hard to keep hold of. 	And yet there may be ways to reconcile these two perspectives. In Let The Great World Spin I believe that the connection between the characters and the tightrope walker are intertwined. The tightrope walker is all of them. It is representative of the pureness and goodness they are all in search of. They are all desperate to find this pureness, inner peace and one within themselves. This connection in society shows them that their lives are just flashes or pieces of a puzzle and when it is all put together then and only then do they see what the final outcome is and how it all comes together in the end. Fiction influences and reflects culture. In the example of McCann’s novel I believe you have a balance of both. It takes from the culture we currently are living in and weaves the story in such a way that it reflects current society, thus it is influencing you along the way with possibilities and perspectives that you may not have thought of before. His idea of a novel is in tradition with time, and the novel’s job is to do accomplish that goal. The novel shows a more positivistic format in which, towards the end you see how the characters have progressed and have improved their lot in life. These are just a few of the characteristics the book holds to show you that it is a novel even though it may not seem that it conforms to the expected. It is done so well and in a way that we understand it because it is how we live our lives, not in one moment but of many moments put together. This is important if we as readers want to be able to relate and feel like we understand what McCann means when he says Let The Great World Spin.Works Cited:McCann, Colum. Let the Great World Spin.

The changing narrators and unfiltered character portraits makes this read like a curated collection of fictionalized HONY interviews. I’d read McCann again."

Sometimes remote, though a shared experience - we all went to school together. Sometimes even more remote. Our lives just bump into one another. Colum McCann has put together an ensemble piece that brings tougher one story of many experiences told from the perspectives of people who barely, or never, know each other, centered around a single day. It is a beautiful necklace that has been crafted here. Do yourself a favor and wear it. You will feel rewarded for it."

263,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1684384-erik,Rating 5 out of 5,"It had never occurred to me before but everything in New York is built upon another thing, nothing is entirely by itself, each thing as strange as the last, and connected.My book club recently read Blindness by Jose Saramago. There was a general agreement that, in nearly 400 pages of blind mayhem, we were not completely invested in the characters. They remained one (or is it two?) dimensional, never enlarging into the seemingly living, breathing, (volume-taking) form that our favorite literary figures must take. This idea of character leads me to the amazing National Book Award-winning book by Colum McCann, Let the Great World Spin. Somehow, in just a few paragraphs (or sentences even), the dozen or so central characters in this sprawling book come alive. The book is really 13 interlinked short stories, most of them narrated first person by a different character. In lesser hands, this approach could easily feel gimmicky. But McCann’s brilliant, often nearly-poetic, writing allows each chapter to work. And that each chapter ties in beautifully (i.e. subtly) to the central story (Philippe Petit's 1974 high-wire walk between the WTC towers) reveals McCann’s skill as a writer. It’s not an easy book to explain. It’s about love and loss (not necessarily in that order). It’s about redemption. It’s about the potential heights of mans’ greatness (Petit’s walk), and the potential depths of his sin (a photo that shows Petit walking the tightrope also shows a plane near the edge of the photo seemingly streaking toward one of the towers). It’s about interconnectedness.An Irishman visits his brother in the Bronx and experiences America.“You asked me if I’m using heroin, man?” He was laughing, but looking out the bar window at the rafters of the highway. “It’s worse than that, brother, much worse.”Mothers mourn the losses of sons (the Vietnam War is recently past).An artist comes to terms with lost love, and, perhaps, found love.There are rocks deep enough in this earth that no matter what the rupture, they will never see the surface.There is, I think, a fear of love.There is a fear of love.A Bronx hooker wonders what’s next after the loss of her daughter. Her language comes alive:I had legs a hundred miles long and a booty to die for. Adam woulda said to Eve, Eve, I’m leaving you, honey, and Jesus himself woulda been in the background saying, Adam, you’re one lucky motherfucker.And so on. If the book sounds sad, it is, at times. But the end is triumphant (and that gives nothing away). If the book sounds amazing, it is that, too.More quotes (for my own recollection):You want to arrest the clocks, stop everything for half a second, give yourself a chance to do it over again, rewind the life, uncrash the car, run it backward, have her lift miraculously back into the windshield, unshatter the glass, go about your day untouched, some old, lost sweet-tasting time.But it struck me, as I sketched, that all I wanted to do was to walk out into a clean elsewhere.They buried her two days later in a plot near the back of their old house. She had told Jaslyn once that everyone knows where they are from when they know where it is they want to be buried. "

It is that rarest of books, the kind that you know will reside inside you for a very long time and will have changed you in some profound way that words can not address. It is a book that, when you reach the last page, will leave you feeling stunned and not sure whether to take a deep breath to digest it all or turn to page one and begin all over again.In a sense this book is an homage to the city of New York. It begins with a true historical event, when Philippe Petit walked a tightrope between the twin towers of the World Trade Center in 1974. It is a marvelous sight. It was ""one of those out-of-the-ordinary days that made sense of the slew of ordinary days. New York had a way of doing that. Every now and then the city shook its soul out. It assailed you with an image, or a day, or a crime, or a terror, or a beauty so difficult to wrap your mind around that you had to shake your head in disbelief"". (p.247)Several people look up to see this tight-rope walker and this shared act of perception is the glue for this book. In some way, each of their lives are inter-connected and will remain connected through time.There is Corrigan, very religious in a social/political/and theological sense, who is struggling between his faith and the woman he loves. Corrigan's love is a Guatamalan nurse, hoping that he will choose her over his God. Ciaran, whose life is in flux, is Corrigan's brother. Tillie is a prostitute in trouble with the law and hoping that the legacy of prostitution will not be passed down to her granddaughters as it has been to her daughter. Claire lives on Park Avenue but also lives in a world of grief, forever mourning her son who died in Vietnam. Gloria is Claire's friend who has also lost sons in the war and wakes up every day to the violence of the Bronx city projects. Soloman is a judge, Claire's husband, who has lost his idealism as he deals with the criminals in his courtroom and tries to please the bureaucracy he is a part of. And then there is Lara, attempting to rebuild her life after a tragedy forces her to look more closely at herself.The book deals with two very powerful themes. One theme is that things occur by utter chance. ""Things happen. Things collide"". (p.133) There is also the idea that things might happen for a reason.""We have all heard of these things before. The love letter arriving as the teacup falls. The guitarstriking up as the last breath sounds out. I don't attribute it to God or to sentiment. Perhapsit's chance. Or perhaps chance is just another way to try to convince ourselves that we arevaluable."" (p68)In this novel, the inter-connectedness of people and events is played out in a way that could be interpreted as either eerie, spiritual, or just plain chance. New York is there, always, in the background. It is a city of crime, love, hate, justice, peace, war and beauty. The city is personified to contain just about every human emotion I can think of. The people are a part of this city and they, too, are a mixture of good and evil, beauty and ugliness. As McCann says in the book, people can be half good sometimes, a quarter bad at other times, but no one is perfect.This book is near perfect. I found the first 25 pages a bit slow but don't let that stop you. This book is a treasure, one that opens up more and more with each page. It is one of the best books I have read in a long time."
265,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/764994-rick,Rating 5 out of 5,"This, McCann’s fifth novel and seventh work of published fiction, is an exceptionally engaging novel, sad and beautiful as the world often is. Let the Great World Spin tells the stories of a set of New Yorkers whose fates overlap with varying degrees of awareness and connection around a single point of time in August 1974: an Irish immigrant monk, a couple of South Bronx hookers, a pair of avant-garde artists, a Park Avenue mother and her husband, a criminal court judge, who have lost their only son, a budding street photographer, and an opera-loving woman from Missouri who lives a contained and proper life in the Bronx although her past is filled with tragedy of lost family members. While the orbits of their personal lives move close and separate (or continue in a shared gravitational pull moving forward) a more public event captures the jaundiced attention of the city in the midst of one of its most doleful eras—one of rampant crime and vandalism, of financial and political bankruptcy—an individual’s daring adventure atop the twin towers of the World Trade Center. Phillippe Petit drops a cable between the towers and entertains a growing crowd as he playfully and expertly tightrope walks between the two buildings. Despite the implicit danger there is nonetheless a redemptive beauty that catches the city’s attention, including that of many of the featured characters; but McCann doesn’t settle for that as the only story of redemption, the only sign of beauty in the bleak city with its burning ghettoes, its overstuffed criminal justice system, and its grieving populace (children lost to the Vietnam War, youthful innocence lost to failed opportunities and self-destructive impulses, great hopes lost to reality’s less than generous capacity for fulfillment). He finds beauty through the eyes of the young photographer in spray-painted work in dark tunnels, in a hooker’s determination to take a rap for her daughter, a pacifist’s willingness to take pointless beatings to remain on a corner serving coffee to women on “the stroll,” in the power of friendship to triumph over race and class, in the ability of the heart to grieve mightily and yet still beat with hope, in the human capacity to reinvent yourself through compassion and responsibility. McCann does test the limits of coincidence but the power of the narrative and the emotional connection he builds between the reader and his characters make the minor excesses there barely a distraction. Let the Great World Spin is a very satisfying novel, a great novel about New York City, about America, and about the human condition. In the movie Down by Law Tom Waits’s character sings a snatch of a song with the line, “it’s a sad and beautiful world.” McCann has written a novel that with conviction documents both the sadness and the beauty. It’s a democratic fiction he writes, convinced, and convincing us, that there are many stories to tell. There are, for instance, as he quotes Aleksandr Hemon in the novel’s motto, all “the lives we could live, all the people we will never know, never will be, they are everywhere.” A handful are in the pages of this novel and, if it is at all representative of McCann’s earlier work, more in those pages and still more to come from this very accomplished and talented writer."
266,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/144579-eh-pi,Rating 4 out of 5,"You may not be a fan of short stories, you may not like heavy themes -- sadness, alienation from family, from self, from history, alienation from God, death of loved ones, sons, daughters, self-betrayal, self-abuse, etc. -- but this book can leave you in no doubt as to the prowess of Colum McCann, and his esteemed position on the pantheon of contemporary American writers. Beautiful lofty prose does not have to distance or outrun the reader, and here, McCann shows off his lyrical versatility in ways that seldom miss the mark. He is very close to his characters. Another thing: how can you not admire a writer who can inhabit so many different bodies? A white Irish immigrant male writer writing the perspective of a black hooker, a black grandmotherly figure who'd known oppression and racism in the South, a white woman who lost her son to Vietnam, a criminal court judge who's Jewish, an Irish immigrant who lost a brother -- all these polyglossic voices are McCann's and remain distinct. He owned them all. And he relates their pain and grief in viscid luminous prose that cuts close to the jugular and remains in shades of haunt. Ostensibly, this is a pre-9/11 allegory. A daredevil tightrope walker, Phillip Petit strung a cable between the two Twin Towers in 1974 and walked across it (he danced, and hopped and sat and laid down on top of the wire too) -- and it's all true. To use this event as an allegory and a celebration of the Twin Towers pre 9/11 is a pretty incredible framework, a grand literary conceit that is, for me, the most thought-provoking pay off from reading this book. So many New Yorkers that day were affected -- the entire city was brought together in perfect unity that day, but oh, in what a dire way. McCann shows us another day when this happened -- when Phil Petit walked across to the South Tower from the North on a tightwire. The characters each have their own story to tell, and their lives intersect in various tangential ways, but really, this is a short story collection broadly functioning under the framework of a novel. And yet, I found myself hankering for a more daring imaginative feat from such a daring conceit and superb writer -- the priest who falls in love with a woman and has to choose between love or faith (that's a very old storyline) and the stories of humanized hookers who are hurting, tender, alienated individuals inside (that's overly done too), the voice of the housewife who seems to lounge about in her grief (that too, you see a lot of in one form or another in short stories). The only two stories that seem a bit more out of the general orbit are the budgeoning photographer wanna-be-graffiti artist, and the computer hackers, but sadly, their stories seem the most 'lost' in this collection, almost stand-alones that function merely as a rubric to encapsulate the act of crossing a tightwire. Surely we can expect more imaginative storylines from such a daring, supple prose-virtuoso? "

Nevertheless still think it's worth 5 stars in my regime of things. Proper review soon...'Let the Great World Spin' uses the tightrope walk between the (not quite completed) Twin Towers in 1974 to bring together disparate lives of New Yorkers (or visitors to NY). This is apt – Phillipe Petit’s walk was an amazing feat of bravado and skill, not only did he run back and forth, at one point he lay on the wire as if sunbathing, relaxed but obviously poised and practised to the nth degree. This book flexes writing muscles with a similar degree of poise and grace and power. Ok, you could argue that the hackers in California section (who phone a NY payphone via computer - early internet pioneers - and hear about the tightrope action) is extraneous – if useful - to the rest of the interlinked stories, and so maybe is the graffiti artist chapter; you could also make a case for the characters being slightly clichéd: there’s the hooker with the heart of gold, and a rich but lonely Park Lane resident, grieving her son's death in Vietnam (also a computer pioneer, the son I mean). However McCann makes these characters, and others - a couple of drug addled artists who only wear 1920s clothes; the lay priest who lives amongst the Bronx prostitutes and is at first beaten by their pimps; his brother who comes to stay; the judge, husband of the Park Lane dweller, who presides over the case of the unrepentant Petit following his walk - believable through detail and an ability to make you feel their grief, anxieties and pleasures. I have to admit that there was more than one sequence in the book where tears pricked my eyes (a bit embarrassing on the train to work, jostled by my fellow commuters). Above all the writing flows beautifully, it has a quality and precision that belies the perhaps clunky ‘state of the nation’ or at least ‘state of the city’ premise the plot might suggest.By coincidence I watched 'Man on Wire', an account of Petit’s walk, all the preparations and so on, just before reading this and you could not help but have in mind 9/11 while you watched even though the film never mentions it. Similarly here - although there is a coda set in 2006 which allows McCann to bring ground zero into the plot (as well as catching up with the characters) - the terrorist attack is in your mind, the back of it, reminding you of the fragility of life, how easily it can be blown off course. In another writer’s hands this could be crass, insensitive, but with McCann you are led from one life to another with the ease and perfection of Petit:Within seconds he was pureness moving… He was inside and outside his body at the same time, indulging in what it meant to belong to the air.. it.. was beauty. Walking was a divine delight. Everything was rewritten when he was up in the air.  "
268,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3695758-suzanne,No Rating,"A book even partially about Philippe Petit, the high-wire artist who walked a cable between the World Trade Towers in 1974, should be, if not light and airy, at least inspirational. The majority of this book was just dreadfully depressing. I did not begin to enjoy it until about 75% through, when some of the stories became more palatable, even appealing. But that was too little, way too late. The great majority of the pages were devoted to life in the slums of New York City; drug-addicted prostitutes who watch their adolescent children following their career path; life in prison so gruesome for one character she spends her entire chapter talking about suicide; and other similarly calibrated scenes of life in the Big City. One of the main characters is killed in a car accident, another suffers obsessive guilt over her part in the tragedy. In the better neighborhoods, the grief of a deceased Vietnam vet’s mother threatens to crush her. Some later chapters were much better. I sympathized with a middle-aged judge ruminating on the failure of his youthful idealistic hopes to make a difference in people’s lives among the reality of the political machinations and deal-making in the NYC court system necessary just to keep the sludge-filled dockets from grinding to a complete halt. I liked the story of two women from very different sides of the tracks suffering misunderstandings that threaten to derail a budding friendship that is very important to both of them. And the chapter narrated by a woman remembering a short intense love affair before her man is killed was a heart-breaker and beautifully told. The few portions of the book that did deal directly with Petit were fascinating and poetic, but the percentage of words about him was very small. I cannot say it is a bad book. It just wasn’t for me. The writing is very good in places, really wonderful in some. In others it uses a staccato, truncated sentence style that really got on my nerves because it went on for too long. But there are many, many beautifully written passages and clearly some evidence of talent here. It is just misused, in my opinion. Halfway through, I became curious about how it might all come together and wanted to see if there was a point to all the relentless sadness and tragedy. I think McCann intended to paint some sort of contrast between the pathetic, sad and sordid lives on the ground with the soaring effects of Petit’s artistry. I’m not sure. And that’s the problem. The two aspects of the book were not adequately integrated for me. If the goal was to point to the redemptive power of art in the face of the gruesomeness of everyday life, it did not succeed in making that connection, although the specialness and inspiration of Petit's achievement cannot be denied. For anyone interested in the topic of Philippe Petit, skip the book. Rent the excellent documentary Man on Wire instead. I envy the people who saw him walk that day. "

The characters, the lives, the idea that we are all tied to one another in ways we are completely unaware of are so real, so undeniably, humanly real. With its relatively limited array of characters, Let the Great World Spin provides a reflection of the world entire and the forces that move us in and out of each other’s lives, that move us through our own lives. I just love this book because it pinpoints a truth so constant and vital we forget it exists—that “The world spins. We stumble on. It is enough.”"

I am sharing it here in case he doesn’t have access to his Goodreads inbox.Hi Colum, I want to tell you my story.‪Growing up, my parents put me on private tutorials for English, Japanese, math, classical piano and science. From elementary to high school, my days lasted from 5:30am - 9pm for 12 years. I started to feel an enormous pressure when I had to do my university entrance exam. I tried to flunk math but by sheer luck ended up in top 6% and got accepted in a prestigious university.For 6 semesters I maintained at least 3.5/4 GPA and even got a scholarship for a dual degree abroad.‬ ‪On my 7th semester my grandfather died (he killed himself) and I failed an exam, for the first time in my life.I didn’t know how to recover. I was burnt-out, alone, depressed, and filled with anxiety. For 6-7 months I wandered around aimlessly thinking maybe it’s better to go away and drown in darkness forever. Safer. It was too much.‬ I couldn’t get out of bed most days.‪One day I decided to do kill myself. I had practice harming myself and I thought I could do it a step further, easy. I walked so many miles my feet literally burnt (this was summer in Australia, on the hottest day of the month so far). I somehow ended up in the library. I sat down and I told myself, “Pick up a book. Any book. Read it until the end. Last a book and decide if you still feel worthless and hopeless by then.” I read Let The Great World Spin. After I finished the last page, I broke down and cried. The beauty of each life no matter how short or ordinary. Corrigan’s whole journey. I realized then I didn’t really want to die. I want to live. I want to feel. Everything. The pain, the love, the loss, the hope. Life is enough. I don’t need to be perfect to live. To stumble through life is living. That’s enough.‪I chose to drop out of college because I was afraid of losing my will to live. I started to pour out my passion in football (am a huge football fan). I started to be active in communities and learning new skills like design, marketing, and about football industry. Within a year I ended up getting hired by a sports media company. ‬Eight years has passed and here I am. ‪This time working for my own company. I’m working on the World Cup, Champions League, the big tickets. The darkness sometimes reappears on the edges of my mind — I don’t think they ever disappeared completely, but this time I’m better equipped because I know I’m more than grades on paper. ‬I know, thanks to you, that being flawed and struggling through ugliness is part of being alive. Thank you. You saved my life."

Mentre l’America tutta è scossa dallo scandalo Watergate e dalla guerra in Vietnam un funambolo cammina nel vuoto lungo un cavo d’acciaio sospeso tra le Torri Gemelle a 400 metri d’altezza e tutti i passanti per un attimo fermano la loro corsa mattutina e alzano gli occhi al cielo increduli, estasiati, spaventati. Petit è li, sospeso nel vuoto, pronto a sfidare se stesso, la forza di gravità, le variabili atmosferiche e le istituzioni, solo per regalare e regalarsi un emozione.Nello stesso momento sotto di lui la vita continua a scorrere. Tante storie si intrecciano, si sfiorano. Ogni voce narrante si racconta con un lessico proprio, adatto al suo personaggio, al ceto sociale, al quartiere dove vive. Il Bronx di Tillie, Jazzlyn, Corrigan e Gloria, Park Avenue di Claire e Solomon, il Village.

273,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/307208-lucy,Rating 4 out of 5,"I didn't like this book until the very end. It seemed filled with many of the tricks and techniques that can drive me crazy in a novel: constantly shifting perspectives from different narrators and a lack of chronology in its plot development that seems artsy but, at times, just feels like lazy writing to me. I wonder if authors that do this actually write two, three, four or more different stories, shuffles the pages together like a deck of cards, and then depend upon the patience of their readers to wait until they choose to tie the stories together, declaring the end result to be a novel instead of a collaboration of short stories. It is also loaded with fragmented sentences. I'm a casual writer myself and champion the effect leaving a subject or verb or both from the beginning of a sentence can have. Keeps things from being redundant and words from being overused. Simply illustrating my point:) So many incomplete sentences, concentrated together paragraph after paragraph, however, made the flow of the page very noticeably choppy. For a time, I let these things irritate me. As I read about the unconventional monk, Corrigan from Ireland, who spends his seemingly futile ministry giving hookers a place to use the bathroom and taking old people out for joyrides in his beat up van, I wondered if McCann was only interested in the underbelly of society. I assumed from the title that his book was going to be about the world spinning, or, in other words, day to day life. Surely, there are lives whose everyday isn't filled with drugs, or pimps or acts of manslaughter or grief from the death of a beloved child. Surely, somewhere, someone is doing laundry, exercising, cooking a spaghetti dinner and speaking with less profanity. Eventually, McCann's spinning world came into focus and it was exactly the beautiful thing I believe day to day life actually is: a friend helping a friend, a stranger doing something heroic, beauty and light forcing its way through the cracks of the chaotic and mundane. With the real life event of a man walking across a wire between the two World Trade Center towers in 1974 as a stunning backdrop, McCann shows how the much more ordinary things, even ones labeled as hopeless, weighted as weary and burdened with ugly, supply the meaning to what we all must endure: life. "
274,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5864496-steven-langdon,Rating 5 out of 5,"Colum McCann writes novels that are superb jigsaw puzzles, made up of what seem disconnected but wonderful segments, vividly presented yet curiously independent of each other. It is only as the book takes its final overall shape, that each of the pieces is seen to contribute to a powerfully integrated impact. This novel is particularly impressive in carrying off this technique.At the heart of this story is the famous 1974 tightrope walk undertaken by Philippe Petit between the two World Trade Centre towers that later became 9/11 airliner targets. One element of the overall narrative is how this striking event lifts the eyes of disparate New Yorkers from their different day-to-day worlds to a common experience. But the substance and texture of the book draws its great strength from McCann's excellent explorations of those diverse lives in their differentiated situations. The author is able to probe achingly the struggles of a radical Irish priest working with social outcasts, who himself is drawn into shattering love of a woman, against all his vows. McCann is equally able to dissect the tortured dynamics of a group of mothers trying to get past the deaths of their sons in Vietnam. Parallels are found in the very different but traumatized mother-daughter ties of a hard-edged but emotionally connected group of black prostitutes. And then there are other characters who at first seem distant from these groups -- yet come in the end to provide some of the connections that provide unity to the book.This novel as a whole is a parable of loss, with its memories of Vietnam, its vivid analysis of urban poverty and its evocative links with the World Trade Centre. It also explores how love can counter such loss at least for a time. It is a book, too, that testifies to the power of beauty in the human battle to overcome loss -- whether this is the poetry that so moves Tillie, the opera that Gloria cherishes or the art that Lara finds so important to her life. The 1974 tightrope walk, the book seems to suggest, is such an example of beauty and human audaciousness.I enjoyed this novel very much. It is intricate, emotionally moving, and a fine portrait of urban America at the end of the last millenium. It has won many awards and deserves them all!"

Maybe it was just that time, the spark had become a fire after so long of doing nothing but smouldering. But I stopped several times to write my own prose. On scraps of paper. In my phone. On the computer. Anywhere I could. Is that a testament to how good the book was? Not really. Its just that it seemed to happen to me.

The book was good in and of itself, no matter what I did while reading it. My biggest problem with it is that it is written in what seems to be the newest literary trend, something I see as uber-modern, which can be seen in Cloud Atlas and A Visit from the Goon Squad and othe rbooks as such- a narrative written in several different voices from as many perspectives that come together only because they are focused around a single event or person.I looked passed that. The prose was just too gorgeous in most places to hate it. However, like most of these books, or with short story collections, some voices are stronger than others and some stories better than others. I've heard a few other people complain that the characters are one-dimensional. I think they're making a mistake in reading it as such. I think McCann wanted the characters to be singularly focused, singel-minded so that the stories would feel the impact of the other lives around them. And on top of that, the book is about refelction. About the reflection of these characters on their lives, the impact on others lives around them because of their singel-mindedness. In the end, the acrobat on the wire just doesn't matter much to any of them. Its a focal point. Its a spark that ignites a fire and spreads across the country and across these lives and brings us this excellent novel.Grade: B+"

The way that McCann tells this story through the eyes of an array of characters who are each on different levels in our stratified society is so true-to-life. The book depicts how the lives of these people satisfyingly collide against the backdrop of a singular event; an unnamed man walking a tightrope across the World Trade Center buildings in 1974. Honestly, this one is a must-read for fans of literary fiction."

Not only does New York have a lot of these characteristics, but it takes pride in them. I enjoy a good museum or a nice show, but I wish I didn't have to switch into fight-or-flight mode to arrive there safely. Whenever I visit, I end up exhausted and convinced that the world would be a better place if humanity ceased to exist.I'm also not particularly fond of fiction about New York. It all sort of blurs together and seems to center around the theme of, ""New York is the best city ever because it is fast-paced and full of sex and drugs, and we are far cooler than you will ever be because we are fast-paced full of sex and drugs! Bow before us, rubes and peons!"" It feels monotonous and condescending.In light of these pre-set dislikes, it is pretty remarkable that I enjoyed this book. The author accomplishes this by counter-balancing my pet peeves. City life might be rushed, but McCann takes his time telling his stories. They aren't plodding or draggy, but it takes a certain amount of time to deal with certain topics appropriately and respectfully, and McCann affords his subjects that respect. In large groups, people tend to let their asshole sides come out, but McCann deliberately picks out characters from these crowds and re-humanizes them--exploring their motivations and complexities in ways you don't get from the superficial social interactions that usually take place in the city streets. I found this to be a really engaging read, which ultimately left me with positive feelings towards my fellow human beings. For a book about New York, that's pretty miraculous.And yes, FTC, I won this book through the Goodreads First Reads program."

One man, with a little help from his friends, an unusual man who didn’t allow notions of impossibility to sully his dreams into nullity, that man walked, hopped skittered danced and jumped from one World Trade Center tower to the other.They were new then, those towers. And no one could possible conceive what would happen 27 years later. But thinking back, looking at a high-wire act for the ages that also happens to frame the stories told in Colum McCann’s “Let the Great World Spin”, and you can’t help but think what a perfect recipe for metaphor, for a new way to understand —and muddle through — this world we live in.That high-wire act is above all things, every single life lived. It’s not a new idea for a novel. In some way every novel, even the terrible ones, maybe even especially the terrible ones, try to and somehow always achieve if only slightly, a new description of the world — a prescription of the author’s beliefs about our world — and sometimes a proscription against it. Personally, and what review isn’t personal, I can be moved, displaced from my own perception of the world and into someone else’s, but only when the novel is truly good, well-written, lyrical, effortless. And this one is. Just let it swallow you up, let go. And as the stories move from one carefully drawn protagonist to another, as this great world of characters slowly grows into a portrait of our America in the 1970s, our world before 9/11, let the nuances within them, the special moments McCann crafts into his novel surprise you, move you to twinges of sadness and joy, and carry you away into the beauty, the grace in every single moment we have together."

If I were rating this novel exclusively on its prose, I would give it five stars. the language is hypnotic at times, evocative of the city whose stories it tells. However, I found myself frustrated a bit with some of the novel's larger elements.The novel opens with a glimpse of the streets below as a tight-rope walker traverses a line stretched between the Twin Towers. It is 1974. The novel then offers chapters dedicated to a myriad of characters who all, in some way, had a connection to the city during this momentous event. While I thought McCann did a marvelous job capturing the voices of each of these characters, I did not find myself connecting in any significant way with any of them. (As soon as I began to feel a connection with a character, another character was introduced.) I understand that this episodic set-up is likely designed to give us glimpses into many lives. If so, I think a collection of short stories would have been more satisfying. As soon as the connections between the characters started to be made, I was simultaneously relieved and irritated. I was relieved, because suddenly there was structure where it seemed there was none. But I was irritated because some of these ties were simply too coincidental; it felt contrived. (I am thinking primarily of Gloria and Claire...and the judge and Tillie.)McCann writes, ""It had never occurred to me before but everything in New York is built upon another thing, nothing is entirely by itself, each thing as strange as the last, and connected."" Here is the secret of this story...the metaphor that McCann is striving for...exemplified by the tightrope walker.I wanted to love this book, but ultimately appreciated the author's efforts more than the story itself.

280,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14968021-frank-o-neill,Rating 5 out of 5,"Colum McCann outdid himself with “Let the Great World Spin”. Like Mozart when he wrote Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, McCann must have been in an artistic trance when he wrote this book, which follows eight New Yorkers of very different backgrounds whose lives intertwine almost magically. Some of the writing is so beautiful it will take your breath away. But don’t be fooled. This is no fairy tale. The story begins on a day in the 1970s when a young street artist tightrope walks between the twin towers of the World Trade Center. His nearly supernatural feat stops downtown Manhattan in its tracks and serves as background to the rest of the story. Much of it takes place in the South Bronx at a time when the Bronx was as dangerous as Baghdad is today. It follows the life of a God-intoxicated Irish priest whose “parishioners” are the hookers who work the mean streets around the Grand Concourse. The story takes an unexpected turn south to a luxury apartment on Park Avenue, where a group of mothers who lost their sons in Vietnam meet to share their grief. Two of the mothers, the wealthy white wife of a judge who lives in the Park Avenue apartment and a poor black woman from the Bronx, form an unlikely bond.After a tragic accident on the East Side Drive, the story follows a pair of young married artists who forsake the New York art scene for a more quiet life in rural Woodstock. It takes a detour to Dublin, where the priest and his brother were born, then ultimately comes back to New York City, where these disparate souls manage to find common ground. McCann, a transplanted Irishman who now calls New York his home, has written a true masterpiece in “Let the Great World Spin”. Little wonder it won The National Book Award."

Although it begins in Dublin in the 50's and ends in NY in 2006, almost all of it is seen through the stories of ordinary people around the time of and on the day of Phillip Petit's tightrope walk across the still unfinished Twin Towers in 1973. As Phililp walks, dances lies down, like an angel in the sky, ordinary people below are stumbling, criminals ""parading"", hookers ""on the stroll"" -- people always walking, some away from grief, and towards love, beauty, hope.The writing is so textured and vivid and grounded in physicality, yet soaring with lovely metaphors. At a time when Vietnam vets are returning home alive, or in body bags, New York is a bankrupt, crime ridden, corrupt city. Yet, McCann shows us the beauty and humanity in the characters. the characters find beauty in others. Some of them are: A worker priest trying to give any solace to the elderly and the hookers, fighting his physical desires for a woman he loves. One of the hookers, filled with humor and pride, yet driven to grief and lamentation. Women grieving the death of their sons in Vietnam, one of them married to the judge who sentences Petit and the hooker on the same day, the hackers at the very beginning of the computing ""internet revolution"" sending out signals, trying to connect electronically. A boy fascinated by the courage of the subway tunnel graffiti artists and taggers . He emerges from the underground and takes a picture of Petit on the tightrope, with an airplane in the image, forshadowing 9-11. These peoples stories all connect in some way, as they carry on, trying to stay upright, a balancing act in a spinning world."

I listened to it, rather than read it, and it may be better as an audiobook than print, but I would certainly recommend either version. There are many characters in this novel and each one has his/her own reader -- all of whom are excellent, but I have to admit my favorite was the reader for the Irish priest (whose character may or may not have been inspired by the actual Berrigan brothers).The construction of the story is built around events on August 7th, 1974 in New York City, ""anchored"" by Phillipe Petit, better known as the guy who tightrope walked between the twin towers in NYC on that date.The structure of the book takes narrative turns with a set of very disparate characters who appear absolutely unrelated at first, but whose fates are intertwined in the events of the day in ways that will surprise you. One of the reviews I read of the book compared it to the movie ""Crash"" and I think that is an apt comparison.Judges, Irish immigrants, hookers, bereaved mothers, drug-addicted (yet commercially successful) artists are all pulled together over the telling of the story in a series of wonderfully drawn character portraits. And NYC has to also be considered a character. McCann has the ability to draw word pictures second to no other author that I can think of... his scenes have so much texture - noise, color, scent, sweat that you are there.One of my favorites in a long time.October 2021: re-read for book club.

Un atto di poesia che sovrasta tutta la miseria e le speranze di un gruppo di persone le cui vite vengono sconvolte da una concatenazione di eventi che le portano a conoscersi e stringere rapporti di cui seguiamo tutti gli sviluppi. Fra prostitute e monaci, artisti e madri disperate, le storie contenute in questo meraviglioso romanzo si intrecciano in modi imprevisti e decisivi.La pluralità dei punti di vista restituisce un mosaico composito e realistico, in cui ognuno dei personaggi ha l'occasione di dire la sua, di mostrarsi in tutta la sua umanità e di raccontarci un altro pezzetto di storia. La progressione non è lineare, quasi tutto il romanzo si svolge in una manciata di giorni, che viviamo e riviviamo insieme ai protagonisti.Colum McCann è decisamente un narratore eccelso, e riesce a entrare sotto la pelle di ognuno dei suoi personaggi interpretandone i pensieri e il linguaggio. In ogni capitolo assistiamo a una metamorfosi dello stile, che tuttavia non scade mai nel banale.L'unica cosa che mi ha lasciata perplessa è stata la scelta del titolo italiano: quello originale, Let the Great World Spin, riprende un verso di una poesia di Lord Tennyson. Il titolo italiano mi sembra di gran lunga troppo lezioso e ""romantico"" per rappresentare una storia così tragica e dolorosamente umana. "

The writing was beautiful and both characters felt multi-faceted and real. For reasons I found hard to pinpoint, I was just never as gripped by any of the other characters' stories and it unfortunately felt hard to get through at times. The writing was still great and I wanted to like it more, I just didn't. It's always hard for me to fault the author too much in these types of interconnected-we're-all-in-this-together story because it's such a risky way to write a novel. Yes, it's their work, but every reader is naturally going to have their own preference of which characters they are most invested in and it's nearly impossible to care about them all equally as you as the reader are yearning for past chapters/points of view. I read other reviews that said they hated the Corrigan sections and loved the parts about Gloria, for example.I did feel some of the characters were a bit one note and stereotypical. I can see why this has such a wide range of reviews--typically for a lot of books you see a star rating that most people pick but this has almost equal amounts of 2, 3, 4, and 5 star reviews. It's the type of book I admire for what it's trying to do or wants to be, but not sure it fully achieved it. I'm glad I read it because I can cross another National Book Award winner off my list, it's been on my shelf forever, and I still found some beautiful writing in it despite it being a slog at times."

Writing is amazing; suspense building.The second chapter, ""Miro, Miro, on the Wall,"" is narrated from the point of view of a woman, Claire Soderberg, and alternates between her account of external events and her stream-of-consciousness. Colum McCann succeeds where Jonathan Franzen fails in Freedom, empathically portraying a woman's consciousness. The third chapter, ""A Fear of Love,"" entails another shift in point of view, to Lara, a new character, who is involved in the automobile accident described in the first chapter. The narrator of the first chapter reappears in this chapter, along with some other characters.We have now read the fourth chapter, ""Let the Great World Spin Forever Down,"" about the cable walker, and begun the first chapter in Book Two, ""Tag,"" which takes us from the heights of the WTC to the depths of the subway, following a character who photographs tags.Wednesday we had our final discussion of the book.

Some of us, like Phillippe Petit, dance atop it until casually reaching the other end, others fall off after just a few steps. But, you know, life goes on. The universe spits out new tightrope walkers by the millisecond. We get a good look at dozen or so here. A tightrope may be a thin thread to tie all these distinct lives together but, hey, Don Delillo used a baseball. Which is a good place to start the comparison game. Imagine this as Underworld without the laborious yet enlightening erudition and, moreover, without the microscopic peek at how we humans work, the minutiae and mystery intrinsic to our motivations. Rather, it’s sort of telescopic, bringing these otherwise mundane orbiting characters into sharp focus. It’s a novel that can go toe-to-toe with the ultra-accessible bestsellers of the world… and not leave those of us who have maybe read Underworld underwhelmed. Also, the novel really does live up to its symphonic tag. Each narrator (there are many) sings out in a unique voice and each voice is artfully pieced into this orchestration. Naturally, some voices grab your attention more than others. But it’s well done, well written. Sure, I only liked it (something was somehow missing for me). But I can certainly see why people love it so much and can think of a few people off the top of my head who might join that long list. "

It's very well written, interesting, has real characters very well drawn, and describes New York as only a native could do it. So why did I have so much trouble with it? It takes place in August of 1974 and sort of revolves around the actual tightrope walk a young Frenchman did between the twin towers of the World Trade Center. The events of the days during and after the great feat are told in a series of first person narratives that have nothing to do with the walker. Rather the action is carried on by people who are sometimes only loosely related to each other and may or may not have seen the walker. And it is here in the structure of the novel that I had so much trouble. The way the author unfolds the events (I won't call it a story) limits the ability of the reader to build anticipation for that is going to happen next. What happens is sometimes shocking or sad or funny but it all happens unexpectedly. As I think about it, anticipation is the heart of a great story. Will she find true love in the end - will the bastard get his just deserts? Take that way and you have a beautifully written novel that seems to have a hole in it.

Until I hit the point where a central character dies. My Lord. All of a sudden, McCann's clever, spot-on prose deteriorates into some college-level creative writing workshop ""use words to trigger a sense of confusion in your reader to mimic the action of the story"" garbage. Yes, I was confused. Yes, I was slightly appalled at the about-face. So I quit reading. My reading list is so long, and the first part of the novel was so very promising, I just couldn't push on through and decided to abandon it. I hope you fare better with this novel.

I think his words are beautiful, touching and sharply written, I think he writes poetry in novels, and I think it’s amazing at all that doing all of this, he manages to keep a plot in place as well.“Dancer” is one of my favourite books (if you haven’t read it, you’re missing out), and in September decided that one of my aims for the next year is to read everything he’s ever written. Of course, I haven’t achieved that yet because there’s plenty of other stuff that I want to read as well, but I am going to try.This is his latest work. It’s set in New York in 1974, and each chapter moves to another character, another person, and they’re all connected.

Typically, a book filled with ""mini tales"" (ok ok vignettes? is that the grown up term?) lacks a cohesive bond, but this book gets the job done 99% of the time. Yes, there are a few chapters where the tightrope walker (the central hub connecting all the stories) gets a bit forced down your throat, but there are enough strong and compelling stories to counter. In my opinion, the best chapters concern the two brothers. The stories of the prostitutes and the upper east side grieving housewife are moving as well. The weakest woudl have to be the artist girl since her story of redemption seems the most cliched and unrealistic. Then there is just the total random chapter of the computer hackers in California who dial NYC payphones to get the scoop from random strangers on the tightrope walker. I know I'm making this all sound jumbled but please believe the writing by McCann is much, much more elegant than my thoughts here. One last note- some chapters are written ""James Joyce"" style (no quotation marks) and others are written normally. Not sure what point the author was trying to make there, nor does it distract much from the story itself."

He is caught as a plane passes behind him, a little of its nose obscured by one the towers. Like the photo, McCann's book manages to evoke both the New York City of 1974 and post-September 2001. Unlike the photo, the book makes little reference to the event it foreshadows. The heart of its subject is unspoken. With writing at times flawed and at times lyrical, Let the Great World Spin has its imperfections. McCann did extensive research about the context for his 1970's characters. However you can tell he was a kid in Ireland at that time, not someone who experienced first hand the bankrupt and dirty, delightfully pre-gentrified Big Apple with its graffiti art, sidewalk breakdancers, and burning Bronx. I'm willing to forgive the book's flaws in light of the author's own daring feat of writing a 9/11 book without 9/11. Because he chooses to place the action a quarter century before, there's a paradoxically nostalgic yearning underneath a narrative where plenty of bad things happen."

I loved most of this book, which is a series of interconnected characters' stories, but would have preferred McCann had stayed with the early characters; I didn't find the later characters anywhere near as compelling. A self-sacrificing Irish priest who lives in the projects voluntarily; a mother who works in a nursing home who is the object of his forbidden love, a beautiful prostitute and her mother - these characters worked for me better than the others and deserved an entire book. The chapter when two of the characters fall in love is beautiful and real, and the memories of a prostitute whose daughter ends up on ""the stroll"" is haunting. The (imagined?) practice sessions of Petit were perfect, but his misadventures getting stuck in the snow were odd and didn't quite fit.

But the writing is beautiful, and each person speaking to me (through the pages) was so believable, and I was reading for a book club, after all, that I stuck with it, if only to be able to complain about it at the next book club meeting. It was only in the last 50 pages that I changed my mind, and really started ""getting"" this story, the intertwining narratives, the connections and coincidences and events that tie the whole shebang together. This is one story where the whole is so much greater than the sum of its parts, even if each part is a pearl all by itself.

Deep, right?Too bad none of the stories were really very interesting. Colum McCann can really write. A lot of the prose was beautiful. About characters I just didn't care about. I always get sad when I read a book with a great story written by, I'll be blunt, an illiterate boob. Then I read a story by someone who can really WRITE, but sadly, he really has nothing to say.

Without ever thumping or rabble-rousing, McCann juxtaposes the human loss in Vietnam and the fall of NYC. The recruiting stations of New York filled the ranks even as the draft numbers echoed through tenement hallways. Episodes build pieces of the city through a mosaic of lives. An Irish monk bent on crafting his own personal hair shirt by ministering to prostitutes on the stroll near the Bruckner Expressway; bereaved mothers meet up for coffee chats focused on macabre touring of preserved sons' bedrooms, where every boy is ""a war hero"" no matter how senseless the death in Southeast Asia was; artist burn-outs desperately snatch at new personas to snag themselves a niche in the capricious pantheon of artworld stardom. The Irish-born McCann reads the city like a native with affection for its hideous contradictions, irreverent vitality, and well-springs of unexpected renewal amidst the ruins. "

It is wonderfully written; very engaging.This book shares the lives of New Yorkers in 1974 who witnessed an unusual event. It explores how their lives interweaved. A man walked a tightrope between the two towers of the World Trade Centre in August 1974. The story feels eerie in parts given the 9/11 events and considering the towers now no longer exist. This tightrope walker was an actual real life person and this was an event that occurred in New York. We later discover how the lives of the New Yorkers who witnessed the tightrope walker connect on deeper levels. It takes a while for this to become clear. The book seems depressing at first with descriptions of difficult lives, deaths, etc.The story moves afar at times and segues to Ireland at one point engaging with the lives of two brothers, one of whom helps prostitutes in New York. As the book progresses, the reader gets to witness rays of hope. I became very immersed in the story. I very much enjoyed the ending.The prose used by McCann is beautiful.

I’m surprised by how strongly this book has stayed with me. McCann’s prose is consistently beautiful and lucid and controlled, but I found the first half of this book a slog. McCann’s main device involves using a different POV character for each chapter, and several of the early sections are spent in the minds of the most self-involved, pretentious ones. The disparate threads don’t connect until the book���s second half, either, so I spent the first 150-or-so pages floundering. The book rewards your patience, however, with the sense of connection that eventually begins to trickle in, and there are some truly lovely moments, ones that have grown and lingered in my mind. I’m glad I read this—and that I continue to try to read “literary” fiction in general, as this book reminds me that despite its pomposity, the genre does offer its rewards."

A single summer day in 1974 New York becomes epic. And the legitimately epic part of that day -- Philippe Petit's wire-walk between the World Trade Towers -- is instead used as background, to frame the whole scene.Here's one excerpt of McCann's writing, from the prologue:""... a longing, an awe, and many of the watchers realized with a shiver that no matter what they said, they really wanted to witness a great fall, see someone arc downward all that distance, to disappear from the sight line, flail, smash to the ground, and give the Wednesday an electricity, a meaning, that all they needed to become a family was one millisecond of slippage, while the others -- those who wanted him to stay, to hold the line, to become the brink, but no farther -- felt viable now with disgust for the shouters: they wanted the man to save himself, step backward into the arms of the cops instead of the sky."""

I got to the last fifty pages of this novel and let it sit for days. I was so apathetic. I've read some excellent novels using the device the author employs here -- really excellent models of this sort of converging multiple narratives. But the application here was so weak. I felt almost as if the writer envisioned a somewhat ""slow"" audience, folks who couldn't be trusted to hang on to the threads so that he could intricately weave the story. The connections seemed cumbersome to me, so self-consciously technical. Also, I'll say it again: White men authors, for the love of god stop inhabiting the Black woman's voice, ESPECIALLY when you are writing about racism. My god. Just give it up. Geez. And when you do it while conjuring up stereotypical Black women personae (uh, like prostitutes?), and then you win a freaking National Book Award for it? Good lord ... "
301,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9830017-vickey-kall,Rating 2 out of 5,"A difficult book. On the plus side, the actual writing is beautiful enough to make you stop and take notes. Chimneys have ""scarves of smoke"" issuing from them. Or how about this: ""Family is like water--it has a memory of what it once filled, always trying to get back to the original stream.""But that is not enough to sustain interest through 350 pages.The story is loose; it's more short stories around a theme. Each character unfolds slowly, with a different voice. But here's the real problem: none of them invites identification. There is no one that you want to root for, no one with whom to empathize. These are all people at their worst moments in life, walking on a tightrope of their own.And honestly, even after finishing it, there are whole chapters disconnected from everything else, the point of which I still don't see.It would be sadistic to recommend this book to most of my friends. If you really, really enjoy literary fiction and loved Olive Kitteridge, you might give it a go. "
302,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/324370-lisa,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was just fabulous. Not without its faults -- it's very talky, more tell than show -- but it's got a huge heart and the writing is terrific. I kept thinking it was one of the best 9/11 novels I've read, although that's only glancingly alluded to at the very end -- which is what makes it work as such. I am not an easy sell on the 9/11 thing.I was finishing up the last few pages on the train in to work this morning and there was one tiny vignette -- I'm not going to spoil it, but it's one of my favorite old Bronx anecdotes -- and for whatever reason, I found myself with tears running down my cheeks. Not because it was sad, but because the emotion in this book ran so close to the surface for me. I think the setting must have a lot to do with it -- various storylines in mid-70s NYC, all circling around Philippe Petit's tightrope walk between the two WTC towers -- but McCann also obviously loves his characters so much, it's contagious."
303,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7850738-lynn-beyrouthy,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is the first book I read about New York City, the geographical muse of so many writers. Let the Great World Spin is not an ode to New York. In fact, the slums, the hookers, the crimes, the segregation and social disparity between Park Avenue and the Bronx for example are some of the evoked aspects of America in the sixties and seventies. I daresay New York City half a century later is still the same. There is still poor districts, prostitutes on the stroll, and racial discrimination contaminating the Yankee complexion with blemishes.Inspired by Philippe Petit's actual tightrope walk between the Twin Towers in the summer of 1974, Colum McCann weaved a handful of completely divergent and independent plots and characters together, interlacing their stories and making their lives interconnected, in the shadow of a reckless acrobat hopping and gliding on a wire attached to the edges of the buildings of the World Trade Center."

One chapter you are listening to a womens club who meets because they have lost children...they see/hear of a man walking a tight rope between the Twin Towers. This distracts them from their purpose of the meeting to relieve them of the grief nestled and nurtured insde them. They get back on track to discuss the losses in their lives, still wondering if that tight-rope walker will live through what seems to be a feat that invites death.Soon you are reading the chapter about how the man trains to walk the rope between the Towers. This is one of the most interesting chapters for me. The man does this because it has not been accomplished and for him it is art formed with the body.Can't wait to read more!"
305,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/592634-betsy,Rating 5 out of 5,"Yes, a rare (for me) five stars from me. This novel, set in NYC in the 1970s, was - remarkably - as good as the reviews. Kind of reminded me of something Tom Wolfe would do - but better writing. A full-bodied look at the city in the 1970s, the novel gives a real feel for the place through very rich depictions of a diverse set of characters (some of whom collide later in the novel) - from a Park Avenue mom mourning the loss of her son in Vietnam, to a handsome Irish do-good monk, a bunch of tough Bronx hookers, a self-indulgent druggie couple of artists, et. al. The overarching metaphor is Philippe Petit's Man on Wire performance, between the Twin Towers, the idea presumably being that living life in NYC in the 1970s was a daring, exciting, go-for-broke high-wire act, with the possibility of danger and thrills, tragedy and grace. "
306,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3201893-bryan-whitefield,Rating 2 out of 5,"Maybe if I had never read Don DeLillo's ""Underworld"" I would have liked this novel much more but being that I have (twice) it is easy to see that Colum McCann owes a tremendous debt to that book as his own borders on homage at certain points. From style and scope to scenes and situations ""Great World"" does its best to live up to the master class standards of ""Underworld"" and fails on all accounts. It is obvious that McCann put a tremendous amount of time and thought into this novel but that was part of the problem for me - you could feel the strain of his efforts on nearly every page. He has locked his characters in a prison cell of heavy-handed sentences for the entire book. I'm usually impressed by ambition in artists but in this case I think the author reached too far, tried too hard and came up short. "
307,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/131369-leigh,Rating 3 out of 5,"Fun read, well-written, good use of the ""strangers with interconnected lives"" plot device that seems to be popping up all over the place recently. I'm a little over the ""Philip Petit"" trope (the high-wire guy in the 70s that walked between the two towers) or maybe I just thought McGann could have done something more interesting with that act since it becomes the connective thread through all the stories. Thought the whole thing (form, plot devices, substance of stories) felt a little bit like a weaker shadow of Don Delillo's Underworld. Its a real city story, though, a real New York story, and it makes you feel connected to city life and the glory and grittyness of New York as a kind of living, breathing, bashed-up, trashed-up mash-up that sometimes still feels like its making up a new world as it goes along. Vita Nuova, New York, New York. "

It was interesting that I could find elements of each person - or better I should say that I was almost looking for elements in each person that I could relate to. McCann's writing had a way of drawing me into the person and trying to feel what they were experiencing. It didn't feel forced, and I was able to identify with elements of people that had lives nowhere close to what I've experienced - in many ways. It was that common humanity that was all orbiting around the central drama of tightrope walker Phillipe Petit's amazing WTC walk that day. "

I had been unfamiliar with Colum McCann before this novel, and after reading Let The Great World Spin I can definitely say I will be searching for more of his work! I found myself adding McCann's quotes into my quote book every few pages, which really speaks to the quality of the writing. Let The Great World Spin is a combination of short stories that all somehow link to the man who crossed the Twin Towers on a wire. The characters are interesting, the writing is stunning, the language and imagery are beautiful. I would not classify it as a page-turner in terms of plot, but the beauty in the words and the complexity of the people sucked me in and engrossed me. It is a well-written and enjoyable (albeit sad!) read, and I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys quality literature. "
311,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27925-edan,Rating 3 out of 5,"I recognize the skill of this novel, and its beauty, and I understand why some love it so much. For me, though, it was too skilled, or too beautiful--in other words, its perfection was distracting. For most of the chapters/stories I was conscious that I was reading--it never swept me away, and I never was wholly taken with the characters, even though they were expertly drawn. I tired of the descriptions, and of how the technique of listing objects/images of New York, was virtually the same for all (or almost) all of the characters, no matter how different they were. There were a couple of chapters that I really liked, and I enjoyed discovering the connections between the characters. But, overall, this one didn't light my fire."
312,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3722823-thing-two,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wonderful! Masterful! Creative! and a pleasure to read is how I'd describe this book by Colum McCann. It's set round the 1974 performance of Philippe Petit who tight-roped between the Twin Towers. This public event is the backdrop for no fewer than eleven characters whose lives intertwine through-out the tale. There is a Catholic priest and his brother, a Guatemalan refugee, a prostitute and her mother, a judge and his wife, a bereaving mother, a hippy, and two more who escape me at the moment. McCann speaks with a distinct voice through each character's chapter, but manages to intertwine their lives in such a way that I was thrilled to discover the forgotten characters when they reappeared. Loved this book! "
313,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6102247-william,Rating 3 out of 5,"""One of those books"" where the author writes a lot of different sort of vignettes in different voices from different perspectives. In my experience these are usually hit-and-miss, and this is no exception. Not surprisingly, this white male Irish author writes best as a white male Irish character, and less well the further he gets from his wheelhouse, all the way down to probably the worst when he writes as a black female American prostitute (who is also obsessed with the poetry of Rumi, because... literariness!). The best of this is actually pretty good, engrossing, even a bit moving, so I'd say overall it averages out to a pretty-good read. Good enough to bother reading, but not a must-read by any stretch."
314,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56801278-k,Rating 5 out of 5,"This novel surprised me.I was not prepared to be so involved in the characters. Each one has their own unique voice, something I think is so difficult to achieve in writing. My favorite part was learning bits and pieces of each person's life through another viewpoint. Everyone was woven in so well with each other. It just goes to show how connected we are in real life, even if we are unaware of it. I think that is the best thing about this book. It creates a hyperawareness without losing the touch of the mundane. Each character is relatable in some way.There is hope in the writing, but despair as well. I don't really think there was even an ending, but a continuation, which is why the title works. You take from it what you want."

It's one of the most amazing stories I've read in a long time. In 1974, a man walked across the Twin Towers (the Twin Towers!) on a tightrope. What was New York like then? People below on the streets had their own dramas and the author intertwines them in a way that brilliant and different from the rest. It is fiction, but this Irish born author can talk about any ethnic/racial/socio-economic group living in the city at that time. He has written every character dead-on in this book without stereotyping. If you don't read this gem, you are missing out on an incredible book. "

After reading this book, I'm happy that when I do go, it will not be the New York City that is described in this book. While I did find many of the characters in this novel interesting, I was disappointed that more wasn't done with some of them and that certain chapters were included, since they seemed to clutter the book with some unnecessary threads. I did find some of the writing beautiful, especially once I got past the first few chapters and the preponderance of fragments the author used, again seemingly unnecessarily. Overall I liked the book, but I feel like it could have used a closer editing in places."

I'm still mesmerized by the melody of voices, the high register and low register diction. If you are swept away by style, McCann is a great writer for you. He uses a story cycle to spin around the image of the tightrope walker who walked the wire between the two towers in New York during the 1970s. By shifting points of view, McCann displays his full range of voice and style. Inherent tension is maintained because of what happened to the towers. What keeps this rather dark book light is that compelling image of the tightrope walker, rising above it all, defying the odds. An image of triumph."
318,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8263807-melissa-schraeder,Rating 4 out of 5," This is a heavy and at times challenging book to read and yet it is so beautiful. The writing is really superb. What I most appreciate is the way McCann thoroughly captures the pulse of 1970s NYC and the ways in which all the characters connect. I have always been moved by how even in a modern city with it's supposed anonymity, peoples' lives really do touch and intersect in meaningful ways. This is the inevitable humanity that follows us everywhere and it is beautifully portrayed in this novel. Side note, the first chapter is VERY long and dull. I'm not sure why McCann started in this way but just keep reading!"
319,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58379876-pablo,Rating 3 out of 5,"Un retrato bastante acertado del Nueva York de los 70, pero que se pierde en historias demasiado desarrolladas de los personajes. Sinceramente, al libro le sobran más de cien páginas, comprendidas por frases existencialistas e historias que se hacen difíciles de seguir. Fuera de eso y como había dicho anteriormente, el retrato de esta urbe estadounidense es muy exacto y hace que te sientas en ese lugar. También el hecho de que todas las situaciones se relacionen con la hazaña de Philippe Petit en 1974 le da un ambiente especial a la trama. En fin, ¿Disfrutable? Sí, por momentos. ¿Lo recomendaría?

The book is comprised of stories from different characters' viewpoints who all are somehow interconnected. The first three characters were tedious and unappealing, while the best two, Gloria and Tillie, were towards the end when I had almost given up completely on the book. While the information about a real life event, Phillipe Petit's tightrope walk between the Twin Towers back in the '70s, was interesting, I think I'd rather watch his documentary. "

Even in all the bleak, fragile lives, McCann finds beauty - in fact, one of the great themes of this book is that it is both in our separateness and connectedness that we find beauty and meaning. We find our own niche, our own story, our own loss, love, joy. McCann must have twelve different point of views and each is rendered pure and clear. He is a master of language but more than his craft, he really sees people and finds a way to catch the beauty and sadness and peace in each moment. Savor it slowly, like poetry."

In this novel Colum McCann has woven a story of many people brought together through an event that celebrates the freedom of life and the desolation of death. He masterfully weaves their tales united by Philippe Peiti. The words, the scenes, the characters are beautifully written about and makes you know that truly the great world does spin and that life can be wonderful even in tragedy.
