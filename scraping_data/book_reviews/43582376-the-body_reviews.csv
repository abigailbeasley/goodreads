There are definitely interesting aspects of the body, but I'm more of a ""fun fact here, quirky tidbit there"" kinda person. I wasn't sure I wanted to read a whole book full of words I can't pronounce. But, no, Bill Bryson really can make anything interesting.His usual charismatic, undemanding style is all over this book. He begins with the head and takes us all the way through the physiology of the human body. The organs, systems, various proteins and bacterium that I will never remember the name of. What really makes this interesting is that he links each part of the body in with the history of medicine and diseases relating to that part. He pulls out little anecdotes that shocked me, infuriated me, and often made me laugh. Bryson knows he isn't writing a book for medical professionals here. There's a certain amount of depth in some chapters, but it feels like a lot is probably skimmed over so us laymen can wrap our heads around the information. And, frankly, it wouldn't be nearly as readable if that wasn't the case.My one big takeaway from The Body is that we know almost nothing about the body. We know so much more than we did a hundred years ago, and yet we still know almost nothing. I swear that about ten times in every chapter, there's a comment like ""these cells do this, but nobody knows why"" or ""women are 10x more likely to get this disease than men, but why is anybody's guess"". I mean, we spend a third of our lives asleep and no one even knows why we do that.I like how Bryson looks at health and disease across the world and not just in the United States and Europe. Though the U.S. comes out of this looking even worse than I would have anticipated. Despite spending more on healthcare per person than any other country, U.S. citizens die younger and have higher rates of chronic disease, depression, drug abuse, homicide, and HIV than almost all (if not all) developed nations. There are a number of theories why, though no one knows for sure.If you like Bryson's previous books, you should like this one. It's pop science, and more fun than it is ground-breaking, but as long as you're not planning to use it as your handbook for experimental surgery, then I see nothing wrong with that.Facebook | Instagram"
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3268839-theresa-alan,Rating 5 out of 5,"I learned so much from this book. One of the things I learned was that continuing to learn and keeping my brain active will help me avoid dementia, so you should read this book, too. I highlighted many pages, so I’ll just offer a few highlights here. The thing I found fascinating was reading about our skin, the tiny layer that we makes us white or black or brown. Bryson watched a surgeon incise and peel back a sliver of skin a millimeter thick from the arm of cadaver. It was so thin it was translucent. That’s what race is. Which is why it’s so ridiculous that such a small facet of our composition should be given so much importance when it’s merely a reaction to sunlight. “Biologically, there is no such thing as race—nothing in terms of skin color, facial features, hair type, bone structure, or anything else that is a defining quality among peoples.”Skin gets its color from a variety of pigments, the best known is a molecule we know as melanin. It’s also responsible for the color of birds’ feathers and gives fish the texture and luminescence of the their scales. Our skin evolved based on our geography. A lot of myths I grew up with are not true. Like the fact we only use ten percent of our brain--false. I was taught as a kid that different parts of the tongue were attuned to different tastes like salty, sweet, sour. Nope. Also, like the movie the Matrix, apparently when I eat a brownie straight from the oven, it doesn’t actually taste good, my brain just reads these scentless, flavorless molecules and makes me think they’re pleasurable. In one of the studies he talks about, a man was given an injection of a harmless liquid to mimic snot. It couldn’t be seen by the naked eye, but under those blue lights detectives use. The test subject went into a room with other folks, and when they turned the overhead lights off and the blue lights on, every single person, doorknob, and bowl of nuts had the pretend snot on it, which is how the common cold passes from person to person so easily—through touch, apparently not by making out with someone (although presumably at some point you might touch that person). Antibiotics•	Almost 3/4ths of prescriptions written each year are for conditions that can’t be cured with antibiotics (like bronchitis).•	80 percent of antibiotics are fed to farm animals to fatten them up, which meat eaters then consume, which is one of the reasons antibiotics aren’t as effective as they used to be.•	Fruit growers use antibiotics to combat bacterial infections in their crops, sometimes even of produce marked “organic.” This means we humans are unwittingly eating antibiotics, rendering them ineffective when we need them for a real disease/infection.There’s a lot more interesting stuff in here. Thanks so much to NetGalley for the opportunity to read this book, which RELEASES OCTOBER 15, 2019."

3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew,Rating 4 out of 5,"The definition of a “well” person?Someone who hasn’t been examined yet(loosely quoted from the book)This book is two things:-	Really interesting trivia about the human body-	TerrifyingI love trivia, and this book had tons of it. This was not a deeply scientific analysis of the human body. It is just snippets and brief anecdotes from various regions of the body as Bryson takes you on a journey through our innerspace. If you are not into big fancy words and meandering analysis, then you need not worry! There may be a time or two that he throws some deeper tidbits in, but it always moves on quickly. A good balance to keep both a med student and the layman interested (just guessing on the med student side as I am most certainly the layman!)So – yay, trivia!However, I will have to say, more often than not, the book journeys off in the direction of what can go wrong with the body. This is not surprising as a lot can go wrong with the body. However, it is not a book to read while eating, if you have hypochondria, if you have germ phobia, if the word “parasite” gives you heebie-jeebies, etc. While it may all be true, perhaps somethings are better off left unknown!With these two things in mind, proceed at your own risk! If you love trivia and don’t mind dumbed down science, this should be perfect for you. If you are a doctor, it may be too simple of an explanation to satisfy – or, maybe not??? If you are easily queasy when it comes to blood, vomit, and other bodily fluids and functions, I would suggest passing on this one.But, when all is said and done, another decent book from Bryson!"

Chapter 20 (When things go wrong) in this book is a must-read one as it is perfectly explaining the current scenario we are facing. This book will help us know more about our body, which might enable us to appreciate its uniqueness even when challenged it is to the extreme by a virus.I read this book amid all the pandemonium I had to face as a Doctor and, more importantly, as a human being. I will share the last paragraph of chapter 20 (page 335) due to its current relevance.

"" The fact is we are really no better prepared for a bad outbreak today than we were when Spanish flu killed tens of millions of people a hundred years ago. The reason we haven't had another experience like that isn't because we have been especially vigilant. It's because we have been lucky.""

Well, it seems that we can't write that sentence again."
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,Rating 5 out of 5,"To know that one does not know how not just even a tiny part of the body works is the first step to getting interested in exploring each fascinating, inner landscape. From up to down, inside to outside, young to old, organ to nerve and so on goes the journey trough our miraculous wonder of nature whose amazing eyes are just sending this information to the brain of the reader.Many myths about the body are shown and design flaws described, but after billion years of evolution, that´s no wonder. We deliberately build in design flaws in everything we create and call it planned obsolescence and what is an appendix or other useless extra bonus parts compared to that.We really don´t understand anything in detail as shown in many great examples and the cool thing is that we once again stand in front of an ocean of lack of knowledge with that stereotypical hand full of sand and much that we believe to know about our body today might turn out to be completely different or even wrong. Especially because of the tininess we still have to explore and to discover areas of nano and quanta. Take physics, we don´t know anything, so what could this say about a system as complex as the human body in a world we hardly understand? Photosynthesis in plants seems to do it´s work with something creepy that just can be explained with some kind of not understood quanta phenomena teleportation stuff and, in some rare cases, we are more complex than vegetables.The most interesting implication of hidden dept comes for the mind, brain, conscience and ego. When over 1 billion copies of this book could be stored in an area of the cerebral cortex the size of a grain of sand, there is pretty much space for unknown programs running in the background, possibly with programming and instructions from wherever and whomever.Because we don´t understand, we should treat the body as good as possible with a diet of things and thoughts of which we know that they are not harmfulLike all of Bryson´s books, it an entertaining and great read, integrating history, medical science and vivid examples that stay in mind and easily find a way to a long term memory whose functioning we don´t understand to associate it with a brain we know nothing about and a mind that,... well, you get the meaning.It´s better and more informative than biology education and in my imagination I see books like this in a close future with much more data, pictures, animations, links of different grade of difficulty for each kind of reader, VR, AR and the integration of the reading audience, probably with a kinda collective reading live streams while using different kinds of technologies or just old school reading. A wiki walk can be as refreshing to the mind as a walk through nature in this completely overrated real-life outside books:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science...Tropes show how literature is conceived and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph..."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3672777-nataliya,Rating 4 out of 5,"Humans are strange and wonderful and yet really really odd. The collection of atoms known as us, a space-ton of DNA, an ecosystem of bacteria, bags of bones and sacks of guts. We are quite interesting although sometimes weirdly senselessly puzzling.
 “The great paradox of the brain is that everything you know about the world is provided to you by an organ that has itself never seen that world. The brain exists in silence and darkness, like a dungeoned prisoner. It has no pain receptors, literally no feelings. It has never felt warm sunshine or a soft breeze. To your brain, the world is just a stream of electrical pulses, like taps of Morse code. And out of this bare and neutral information it creates for you—quite literally creates—a vibrant, three-dimensional, sensually engaging universe. Your brain is you. Everything else is just plumbing and scaffolding.” 
Bryson takes us on anatomical tour of the body, system by system, dropping sexy names like Pacinian corpuscles and Islets of Langerhans along the way while also giving a bit of history of medicine and medical discoveries (Typhoid Mary and discovery of antibiotics and insulin are a must, and my sheer horror at finally learning why “lithotomy” position which I’ve blissfully said countless times is actually called that, and not to forget Phineas Gage and his frontal lobe injury and the absolute horror of lobotomies and the sheer idiocy of bleeding people to cure all ailments 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️) and ultimately arrives at dangers of over-caloried sedentary lifestyle unsuited for the bodies evolved for hunter-gatherer needs, overtreated for often little to no benefit.
 “We live in an age in which we are killed, more often than not, by lifestyle. We are in effect choosing how we shall die, albeit without much reflection or insight.”   It’s fun and easy and accessible, and full of tongue-in-cheek humor because we are all made a bit funny (and because without humor you might as well pick up a stuffy anatomy textbook - but don’t let it be Gray’s since Gray was a petty jerk who went to some lengths to keep “his” book from being Gray and Carter’s Anatomy) and countless digressions and detours which I found quite entertaining as this audio book took me through sedentary commute to and from work (unhealthy) and nice walks in lovely summer weather (a healthier choice). Not to mention taking on a few myths and misconceptions about the body that have been around long enough to feel true - and yet they aren’t (take that, eight glasses of water a day or using 10% of the brain and similar silliness).The information may be familiar, but the anecdotes are not always so (and even when they are, Bryson’s delivery still freshens them a bit) and therefore the entertainment value holds. Yes, it’s simplified and sometimes some accuracy may be questioned, but for a popular medicine book it actually fares quite alright.Oh yeah, and you can build your own Benedict Cumberbatch for about $150K, give or take a few pennies. Looking for a blueprint now…

How to make a human body:
Blend together the right amount of each of 59 elements, at a cost of US$151,578.46 according to the Royal Society of Chemistry.  ~Or~If you don't have that kind of money lying about, you can also do it the old-fashioned way that involves heterosexual sex. I'm not here to judge your methods; make a human whichever way you please.  What I am here to do is tell you that Bill Bryson has done it again!  He has written yet another brilliant and vastly interesting book, this time about the human body. Whether you want to know about bones or skin or digestion, muscles or brains or bacteria, you'll find it in this book.  I don't even know where to begin in telling you about the contents.  Whilst some things I already knew and thus this was a refresher, there were even more that I didn't know and thus made my brain very happy.  There are just so many interesting facts wrapped up in this book.  A random few from my highlights:•""You have a meter of [DNA] packed into every cell, and so many cells that if you formed all the DNA in your body into a single strand, it would stretch ten billion miles, to beyond Pluto.""•We shed over a million flakes of skin every hour, leaving behind about a pound of dust every year.  (Easy way to rid yourself of a pound, but for some reason I've never seen it in a diet book.)•If you could ice skate on cartilage, you would go 16 times as fast as on ice, due to the smoothness of cartilage.•""In the second or so since you started this sentence, your body has made a million red blood cells."" (and used a dozen muscles just to read these words)•""The length of all your blood vessels would take you two and a half times around Earth.""•""Every gram of feces you produce contains 40 billion bacteria and 100 million archaea.""  (Now that's something you can impress your co-workers with at your Christmas party!)•The ""the death rate for infectious diseases has been climbing and is back to the level of about forty years ago.""  This is due to bacteria evolving resistance to our antibiotics, partly because of the copious amounts of antibiotics that are fed to livestock (a good reason to cut out meat and dairy!) and the over-prescription of antibiotics, especially for illnesses that are not helped by them (please stop asking your doctor for antibiotics for colds!).The award for my favourite tidbit of information in this book goes to:•All of your skin colour is in ""a sliver of skin about a millimeter thick"".  Did you get that??  ALL of the pigment in your skin is in a sliver so thin that you can see through it!  ""That’s all that race is—a sliver of epidermis.""  For this we have enslaved millions of people, killed, hated, treated unfairly, imprisoned.  For a translucent sliver of skin.   Stupid reason if you ask me, especially when you consider that if you go back far enough, every single person on earth has ancestors who came from Africa.  We ALL had black ancestors.  We ALL came from Africa.  The original skin colour of homo sapiens was dark, so stop already.  Stop hating on people over a sliver of skin.  If you have ""white"" skin, it's due to a gene mutation, a freak gene that happened to get passed on because our ancestors needed Vitamin D after they left Africa.  Not because you are somehow superior to people who have more melanin than you.  Got that?Those are just a few of the many things I highlighted in this book (it's best to have a Kindle copy if you don't like marking up paper pages).  If you enjoy learning new things, if you like to know what makes you you, or if you have an extra $151,578.46 on hand and want to know the ingredients required to create a human body, this is the book for you!"
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,Rating 5 out of 5,"I like Bryson, his books are often amusing and informative. He has a good eye for details that will keep the reader engaged or outraged or just smile. This is a tour of the human body, but it includes stories and asides about people associated with the discovery of various diseases or a cure or a system in the body. Some books on this topic can get a bit carried away with long names for parts that involve endless Latin or Greek. A nice thing he does here when he does give these is to say what the words mean in English, often interesting enough in itself, and to say why the person naming it that might have thought that was a good idea.I didn't realise that the X-chromosome was called that because the person who discovered it didn’t know what it did – and so, like ‘planet X’, the letter was chosen due to this mystery rather than for the chromosome’s shape. And the Y-chromosome was likewise named following on from X in the alphabet.You come away from this thinking that a lot of people are basically bastards. I won’t spoil the stories, but the person who took credit for Streptomycin fits this category particularly nicely. This is a quick read and an interesting one. Particularly good is the last chapter – you know, we are all going to die sooner or later and so death often sharpens our interest. I’ve become fascinated by the idea that no one is allowed to die of ‘old age’ any more. You have to have died of something, but as Bryson says, getting old generally involves multiple things going wrong with you – and so picking one generally ignores the significant contribution one or other of the things you were suffering from inevitably played in your demise. Perhaps saying ‘he died of old age’ as the cause of death would be in fact be more accurate. Some of the things people were allowed to die of in the past seem so much better than heart disease or cancer - like ennui, for example. ""I think he died mostly of listlessness..."" As I said recently to a friend of Facebook – the category of deaths I would choose for myself would be ‘peacefully and in his sleep’."

I like these words:“Exercise regularly. Eat sensibly. Die anyway.”Anyway, I agree that quality of life is the priority, hopefully, most of the time we are living happily and healthy.I recommend you to read this book so that we know more about our bodies and the functionality of most of our body organs.We should keep and maintain our bodies healthy always."
10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s,Rating 4 out of 5,"I read this off and on for over a week, I think reading it straight through would not have left me time to ponder the information and possibly would have been a case of too much at one time. Our bodies, many systems and other developments of which I knew little all in one book. I actually own a copy because this is another that I feel deserves more than read. Or at least to have as a reference. There is a huge amount of research that went into this book. Bryson is good and picking out information and identifying unsung, unknown heroes. As informative and as I found it, it seems Bryson has traded his trademark sit for some gross examples. Thankfully, I have never encountered these relatively rare conditions. Shuddered at all the diseases, viruses we don't get, there were quite a few. Our body is quite a compact and intricate mechanism. It's a wonder that more things don't go wrong.I still have two unread by this author that I'm saving for a book drought, along with books from a few other favored author. This is an author loved by many, and he explains our bodies in an easy to understand fashion. Though I did miss the humor , of which there was some, but not as many instances as in previous books. Definitely worth reading, regardless."

The Body: A Guide for Occupants has you covered! For those of us who haven't had a biology class since we fulfilled some course requirement ages ago, Bryson gives an excellent overview of what doctors and scientists know about all our different body parts and bodily functions. This book does for biology what books like Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong or A People's History of the United States have done for history; it updates and corrects some common misconceptions that may have been passed on to us at one stage or another.Bryson's dry wit will come across even more clearly when this is eventually made into an audiobook.  While reading, I imagined Alton Brown reading the text in the same manner he talks to the audience in Good Eats. Bill Nye would be a great narrator, too! It's clear that The Body is aimed at a general audience. (Readers who specialize in the biological sciences might want more detail than this book provides.)One caveat, particularly for Goodreads reviewers--more than our fair share of us have had frustrating or scary ""adventures"" through the medical system. Since Bryson spends a surprising amount of time discussing the things doctors *don't* know, this aspect of the text could be unsettling. Four stars for the print version--and if the audiobook is available when you're making your purchasing decision, I would definitely give this a listen.Thanks to Doubleday and NetGalley for my DRC of this book, which will be available for purchase on October 15th."
13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/115625-thefourthvine,Rating 1 out of 5,"People who should read this: those who really, really enjoy book reports. People who should absolutely not read this: trans people, people with chronic pain, fat people, anyone with a degree in any aspect of biology, anyone who reads more than one popular science book a year. The thing is, there are basically three ways you can go with a book like this. There’s the complete and in-depth approach, which is absolutey ruled out here; you can’t cover the human body completely in four years of medical school, never mind in a single book. Then there’s the fun facts approach, which Mary Roach has absolutely perfected; you give a brief overview and then you delve into interesting and possibly amusing things your reader probably doesn’t know. That’s where I thought this was going. And then there’s the massively oversimplified, somewhat dull book report, and that’s where this unfortunately ended up. This reads like Bryson read approximately 400 books, summarized each one in a single page, and then added an introduction and a conclusion. And that’s a problem. The reason each of those books was written was that their topics could not be adequately covered in a page. So every time I happened upon an area about which I already knew some things — or when I’d read the same book Bryson had for that particular bit — I found myself hissing, “But you’re MISSING THE POINT” or “But that’s — that’s so superficial it’s actually inaccurate” or just “Seriously? Seriously??” I had particular concerns about his discussions of sex and sex chromosomes, which was so simplified and bad that it pretty much went directly to a TERF place. (The problems start with him saying everyone has two sex chromosomes, and that if you have XX you are always female and if you have XY you are always male, and then they sort of go on from there. Biology is more complicated than your fifth-grade-level overview suggests.) He also manages a neatly internally contradictory discussion of the Death Fat that spans over multiple chapters. (Especially enjoyed him explaining in one chapter some of the reasons humans are fatter today than previously, only to explain in another chapter that we all just eat too much and don’t exercise enough. Also there’s a good bit where he explains that fat is definitely killing everyone early, only to point out a bit later that some of the fattest populations on the planet are also the longest-lived. And so on.) There’s also a fun spot where he describes Alexis St. Martin, who was an intensively mistreated victim of constant unethical experimentation by a physician, as “not the most cooperative of subjects.” There’s a lot of stuff like that, that Bryson lightly glosses over and really, really should not. When the book’s not enraging, it’s just dull. Bryson mostly elides his own narrative voice, which is his main strength as a writer, in favor of pretending to be an authority, so we get an endless dull recitation of facts that many readers already know. (And many of which we learned from more engaging books than this one.)This book left me sad and frustrated and took me so long to slog through it messed up my holds at the library. A solid loser, all the way around. "
14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,Rating 5 out of 5,"Until now, I only knew Bill Bryson for his snarky travelogues. My buddy-reader, however, informed me that his non-fiction book was very good indeed. Besides, many biology books suffer from the fact that their authors are great scientists but horrible writers. So I wanted to read something that had the potential to be entertaining as well as educational.The book is divided into these chapters:And yes, we did get a little bit of humour, but that wasn't because Bryson made fun of certain things, but was very good at pointing out the hilarity of history and us silly homo sapiens.Bryson decided to explain anatomy to the reader as well as giving historical and practical context. We thus hear of the abominable Typhoid Mary, a women who, at one point, found out she was one of the rare carriers of typhoid without showing any symptoms, but decided to still work in kitchens (against a promise she had made to the authorities) and didn't even bother to wash her hands before preparing meals, thus spreading the disease until she was finally put under house arrest.Or Nicholas Alkemade, who served in WW2 and jumped out of his plane (his parachute had burnt to cinders and he preferred not to burn to death), survived falling 5500 metres into a pile of snow (after having been slowed down by some pine trees) and suffering only a sprained leg. After the war had ended, he worked in a chemical plant where, while removing chlorine gas-generating liquid from a sump, he received a severe electric shock from the equipment he was using. His gas mask became dislodged and he began breathing in the poisonous gas. After 15 minutes, his appeals for aid were finally answered and he was dragged to safety, nearly asphyxiated by the fumes. Not long after, a siphoning pipe burst, spraying Alkemade’s face and arms with industrial sulphuric acid. With astounding presence of mind, he dived head-first into a nearby drum of limewash, thereby neutralising the acid and escaping with only 1st-degree-burns. He returned to work, but was pinned beneath an almost 3m long steel door runner that fell from its mountings as he passed by, escaping - somehow - with only minor bruising. However, after this, even he came to his senses and decided to no longer tempt fate. He thus became a furniture salesman, dying peacefully in June 1987.Just two examples of how remarkable and resilient the human body can be (though Mary, in my opinion, was mostly an example of being sick of mind). There are others, of course, such as people being trapped in frozen lakes or extremely cold weather, who are afterwards successfully (slowly) warmed up and who survived (babies even).The book is full of other fascinating facts as well. Many of us know, for example, that damages to our frontal lobes result in personality changes, which was the reason lobotomy became popular at one point in human history (Rosemary Kennedy was lobotomized because her father considered her too willful, something Bryson mentions in this book, too). Did you also know that it's 400 times more likely that a teenager is in an accident if said teenager is accompanied by another teenager?! And this isn't just limited to car accidents.Or did you know that we always say ""our 5 senses"" but that there are many more? Like the sense that tells us if we're lying down or standing upright even when our eyes are closed? It's called proprioception (our sense of where we are in relation to the space around us).Or did you know how many things we still cannot explain? One such thing are emotional responses like crying when sad - it has no physiological benefit AND is the same response as for joy so why are we doing it?Science, it's history, trials and errors but also impressive feats from hundreds of years ago, groundbreaking discoveries (the most well-known example being penicillin), modern appliances and procedures but also problems that will become more dangerous in the near future ... I was delighted how Bryson presented it all comprehensibly and explained it in a way every layman can understand, often giving examples from every-day occurrences, always showing just how much he is fascinated by the subject(s) himself.A wonderful look at an important and thrilling subject (us) by a seriously talented author - just don't be prissy about digestion or our insides. ;P"

It even has the distinction of not being science fiction at all.But as the title suggests, outright occupancy usually comes with a rental charge. The bill always comes due.I've read a few Brysons before... and my favorite has got to be A Short History of Nearly Everything. This one, from a regular knowledge-gathering stand, comes in as a tight second. The travelogues are fun and often funny, but Short History is pretty comprehensive and rather more funny. This one, however, was not very funny at all. That's okay. Very little about our bodies, aside from sex and farts, is funny.Bryson DOES, however, accomplish a lot, go over a LOT of ground. Pretty cool, in fact. Do I recommend reading this? Absolutely. Everyone ought to have a primer on themselves. The benefit here is much more than meets the eye, though. So many new discoveries and outright debunking of myths have made it in this text. Recent ones, too.You know that leaky faucet and the clog in the pipes? Yep. We really need to talk to the landlord.

And, of course, we also have the opportunity to enjoy the Bryson wit. This is a field trip through the human body and I was astounded at the level of research needed to write such a book. And I admit there was so much I did not know about the body and how it is built to repair itself. This is an informative guide as well as a source of humour, now and again. Read it for the pure pleasure of enjoying one more Bryson book. Highly recommended."

The book is surprisingly detailed, for a popular-science book. Bryson exhibits his usual knack for the extraordinary and unusual, but despite veering close to it at times, he avoids the pitfall of making this book just a tour of the oddities of the human body. Bryson takes just enough such detours to keep us amused, but just like a good tour guide ensures that we are adequately educated as well. The best thing about Bryson, as best exhibited in A Short History of Nearly Everything, is his knack to make everything he touches so memorable. I am sure if a quiz was added after each chapter, most of his readers would fare very well in them. Did you know it takes more time for food to move through a woman's digestive system, than a man's? Who would've thought to include that in an anatomy book? However, is this the best book to pick up if you are interested in reading about the Human Body? It might be the most fun book, but I am sure even Bryson would recommend Daniel Lieberman's The Story of the Human Body over his own book if you could read just one anatomy book. After all, he refers to Lieberman so often that it sometimes feels like this whole book is nothing but a detailed review of Lieberman's magnum opus. If you can spare the time for two, by all means, get both.Towards the end, Bryson comes to the real point of why we are reading the book - how to keep ourselves healthy. He takes us through a tour of nutrition science, exercise science and even of mortality. In the end, Bryson leaves us with the message that it is not that difficult to live a good life - you just have to take good care of your most precious resource - your Body."
19,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3292905-julie,Rating 5 out of 5,"A truly amazing compendium on the human body aka ""a warm wobble of flesh!"" Truly engaging and enlightening. Occasionally I wanted to fast forward to avoid the details, but mainly I was truly engaged, appalled or enthralled!My personal favorite of Bill Bryson's anecdotal stories:The emergency appendectomy on a US submarine during WWII. The ship's pharmacist assistant was ordered to operate without any knowledge or equipment, as he as was the senior medical personnel on board. This is a little mind-boggling to me, as I would expect that there would be a trained medical doctor on board at the very least. Anyway, the pharmacist assistant successfully anesthetized the patient by guessing at the quantity of anesthesia to administer. Then, he successfully performed the appendectomy ""wearing a tea strainer lined with gauze as a surgery mask and guided by little more than a first aid manual."" Truly amazing!  Surprising fact, which had somehow passed me by: women in labor today have the same pain relief options as their great grandmothers.Conclusions: 1. We could avoid a lot of diseases by living more sensibly. LOL!2. We have been successful in extending life, but not in improving the quality of life.4/29/20 Update: Reading this for a second time with my hubby. Bill Bryson's matter of factness and humor make for a perfect listening experience during this stay-at-home time."
20,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book was given to me as a Christmas present, and it was a great gift. As a fan of Bryson, I was surprised that I had not even heard of his new work of popular science. I am glad that it came to my attention, then, since this was my favorite Bryson book since A Short History of Nearly Everything. Structured as a tour of the human body, the book made me feel right at home. No matter what the subject, Bryson’s style is consistent: snappy prose, engaging anecdotes, and fun facts, all tied together with a lot of curiosity and humor. At its worst, this can make for some superficial books—a meandering array of factoids with little structure—which in my experience plagues his history writing. But science seems to bring out the best in Bryson. Here, the writing is disciplined and controlled. He clearly did a great deal of research and organized his facts with care. And Bryson has a rare talent for research. You would think that, in our media-saturated age, most of the great stories and characters from history would be known. But somehow Bryson is always able to uncover an unsung hero with an eccentric personality. The history of science seems particularly rich in this.Bryson not only unearths unsung heroes, but surprising information. Bryson is a fun fact factory. Arguably, fun facts are the very definition of superficial knowledge; but Bryson’s curiosities are irresistible. There were so many things about the body—about digestion, sleep cycles, anatomy, disease—that I did not know, and so many things that surprised me. For example, I learned that our eyes do not only have rods and cones, but photoreceptive ganglion cells; these do not contribute to vision in any way, but tell us when it is light or dark. This is why some blind people instinctually know if it is day or night, or even if the light is on or off.Bryson’s style is also well-suited to popular science. His jokes, comments, and asides can be distracting in other contexts; but when reporting potentially dry scientific information, the humor helps. And it must be said that Bryson’s two biggest preoccupations—things we do not know, and things that can kill us (or ideally both)—have ample material in a book about the human body. Indeed, this book gave me a bit of death anxiety, since Bryson dwells on all of the things that can go seriously wrong and how little we know about the why. The scariest thing, for me, was the section on antibiotics. The rate at which bacteria adapt to antibiotics is far outpacing the rate at which we are discovering new medicines. (And our flagrant overuse of antibiotics is certainly not helping.) If we do not somehow reverse this trend, we can have a real crisis in the near future.If the book has any takeaway, it is that lifestyle is important. Exercises is tremendously beneficial; and inactivity is likewise lethal. A good diet makes a big difference, too, as does avoiding obviously harmful activities like smoking and excessive drinking. Our bad habits in the United States are partially why we lag behind other developed nations in life expectancy. As Bryson also points out, our health system is not particularly good, either, despite the enormous costs involved (several times the prices in other countries). Indeed, the American health system is not only lagging behind other countries, but is actively creating problems. The most obvious example of this is the opioid epidemic, which is largely caused by overprescribing pain medication. And the reason that these medications are only overprescribed in America, it seems, is the unsavory relationship between doctors and drug companies.As you can see, there is a great deal of interest in these pages—from the history of science, to the development of modern medicine, to the science of anatomy and physiology—none of it dense, dull, or otherwise difficult, but rather witty, charming, and altogether fun to read. I recommend it."

It is based at the university where I work for one day a week and it meets a lunch time, once every two months. This is the book for January; it’s not something I would have read in normal circumstances. Bryson employs his usual wry and laconic style and applies it to the human body. This isn’t a medical text book, but it is detailed and covers pretty much what you would expect. Bryson does cover the history and development of medicines, surgery and approaches to the body. He also uncovers some of the lesser known pioneers of medicine, those history has forgotten. Bryson tells their stories and uncovers their foibles in an entertaining way. The book is full of facts, it must be a dream for someone who goes to quizzes a lot, although there are some interesting ones as well. Bryson estimates that austerity in Britain has led to about 120 000 preventable deaths. He attributes the fact that Americans die at a younger age the Europeans to lifestyle. Bryson also takes a more global perspective and looks at the battle with infectious diseases and our overuse of antibiotics which has led to antibiotic resistant bugs. Bryson takes a look at the opioid crisis and at some of the medical techniques that did not stand the test of time; lobotomy for example.There are lots of interesting facts, many obscure diseases, lesser known medical operatives and trillions of cells. It is informative and Bryson is, as ever, a great raconteur. However I was left asking WHY? What’s it all for, interesting though it is? I’ll keep you posted on the book club!"

От нея ще научите отново да се удивлявате на това, което представляват собствените ни тела. Вътрешното ни устройство и процесите, които протичат в нас, може да изглеждат закономерни и дори банални, но все още не сме стигнали до това ниво, в което телата ни да спрат да сащисват дори учените, занимаващи се с тях.В “Тялото” Бил Брайсън разказва по-интересно от всякога. Общите черти на нашето устройство са предадени сбито и максимално достъпно, като се редуват с медицински куриози, много от които откровено плашещи.От тази книга научаваме за някои наглед необясними взаимовръзки – защо потта ни е направила умни същества, защо всеки от нас усеща света по различен начин с обонянието си, а също и кои са най-застрашаващите болести за съвременния човек и защо е така. “Тялото” ни кара да се вглеждаме в себе си. Докато я четях, на съответните места въртях палци, кляках, разгъвах лакти, запушвах нос – за да се уверя в простичките и гениални механизми, с които като по чудо сме снабдени. Замислих се и колко и какво ям (не че не го мисля така или иначе), колко се движа, колко спя. Интересни ми бяха сравненията между здравните системи на развитите демокрации и стряскащото несъответствие между огромните суми, които САЩ наливат в здравеопазване и печалния здравен статус на американците. Връзката между богатство и дълголетие едва ли би учудила някого, но тук тя е потвърдена, макар и да не е обяснена. Брайсън, както винаги, разказва увлекателно и компетентно, но и с ентусиазма на човек, който на 66 годишна възраст продължава да изпитва възхитата на ученик, пред който са разкрили големите тайни на Природата. Знанието не е притъпило способността му да се удивлява на неща, за които повечето от нас или нямат представа, или приемат за даденост. Нашите тела са съвършени регулатори, у��троени така, че да не се унищожават лесно, дори когато имат за стопани такива безотговорни същества като нас, които всячески ги товарят с големи количества вредности и токсини. Цяло чудо е, че функционираме при толкова много усилия да саботираме здравето си и при наличието на всевъзможни патогени навсякъде около нас. Дължим огромна благодарност на нашите тела! Две главни достойнства на “Тялото” – първо, имаме факти от историята на медицината и пионерите-откриватели, без които днешното ни дълголетие и здравен статус щяха да са невъзможни. Отрезвяващо е да си припомним, че само две поколения назад хората са имали не само по-ниска очаквана продължителност на живота, заради високата детска смъртност, но са и умирали от неща, които днес не са непосредствена колективна заплаха за човека. Второ, книгата е много съвременна. Брайсън ни дава както статичната картина на телата ни, така и моментна снимка на това къде се намират нещата като лечение на различни заболявания и мнения на водещи световни авторитети. При целия този научен напредък има и толкова много неизвестни – много често се обяснява как протича една или друга реакция на организмите ни, като причината завършва с лаконичното “все още не знаем защо е така.” Да разкажеш за сложното по интересен и достъпен начин – две качества, които фатално отсъстват от българските учебници, се е удало чудесно на Брайсън. Ставам банална с тези български учебници, но се питам колко ли хора са загубени за науката в ранна възраст, само защото образованието успешно успява да ги отврати от нея. “Всъщност, биологически погледнато, расата не съществува. Нищо, свързано с цвета на кожата, чертите на лицето, типа коса или костна структура, не е определящо качество за човека.”“Според британския Нобелов лауреат Мах Перутц, през XX век ваксините вероятно са спасили повече хора дори от антибиотиците.”"

I have to admit I would have been bored if I'd tried to read this straight through but tackling a few pages every night at bedtime turned out to be fascinating and educating. There is a lot of trivia about not just the body itself and how it works, but also about scientists and doctors and their discoveries, sometimes accidental, the sometimes wrong conclusions they came to, and health care systems all over the world. My conclusions at the end of this book: The body is an incredible machine that does everything it can to keep us alive, most of the time without us even knowing about it. In the end, it really is a crap shoot, so enjoy it while you can. Or as Bill Bryson says at the end of the last chapter that describes what happens at death - ""And that's you gone. But it was good while it lasted, wasn't it?""  Carpe Diem!"

We've all heard that rather gooey truth ""We are all made of stardust..."" but read this book, and you will learn even more extraordinary truths. We are phenomenal creatures. If you aren't filled with a fantastic sense of wonder whilst reading this then pinch yourself hard, because something is missing. As well as conveying a huge bundle of facts in a fascinating fashion, Bryson also makes his readers laugh. I love this guy's sense of humour. That eased off a bit towards the end as he started talking about the body in old age. I possess a 69-year-old body, and I quaked a bit when I learnt the degree to which us older folk are more prone to problems. I presumed that I knew that already, but to see it so clearly laid out in print is daunting. For instance ""An eighty-year-old person is a thousand times more likely than a teenager to develop cancer."" Whaaaaaat? Although he doesn't dwell overly on the negatives of being elderly, the book nevertheless brings home to you with a thump some of the downsides of ageing.Here are a few of the topics discussed, just to give you a flavour of the book.....RUNNING
""The back of your head is a modest ligament, not found on other apes, that instantly betrays what it is about us that allowed us to thrive as a species. It is the nuchal ligament and it has just one job: to hold the head steady when running. And running – serious, dogged, long-distance running – is the one thing we do superlatively well. We are not the speediest of creatures, as anyone who has ever chased a dog or cat or even an escaped hamster will know. The very fastest humans can run about 20 miles an hour, though only for short bursts. But put us up against an antelope or wildebeest on a hot day and allow us to trot after it, and we can run it into the ground. We perspire to keep cool, but quadrupedal mammals lose heat by respiration – by panting. If they can't stop to collect themselves, they overheat and become helpless. Most large animals can't run for more than about 15 kilometres before they drop. That our ancestors could also organize themselves into hunting parties, to harry quarry from different sides or drive prey into confined spaces, made us all the more effective. Fossil evidence suggests that early hominins were walking by about six million years ago, but needed an additional four million years to acquire the capabilities for endurance running and, with it, persistence hunting. 
SWEATING
Unlike the rest of the body, the palms don't sweat in response to physical exertion or heat, but only from stress. Emotional sweating is what is measured in lie-detector tests. 
ANTIBIOTICS 
Before penicillin, the closest thing to a wonder drug that existed was Salvarsan, but it was effective against only a few things, principally syphilis, and had a lot of drawbacks. For a start, it was made from arsenic, so was toxic, and treatment consisted of injecting roughly a pint of solution into the patient's arm once a week for 50 weeks or more.The (current) rate of antibiotic withdrawals – because they don't work any more or have become obsolete – is twice the rate of new introductions. The obvious consequence of this is that the arsenal of drugs we have to treat bacterial infections has been going down and there is no sign of it stopping. What makes this much worse is that a great deal of our antibiotic use is simply crazy. Almost three-quarters of the forty million antibiotic prescriptions written each year in the United States are for conditions that cannot be cured with antibiotics..... Even more appallingly, in the United States 80 per cent of antibiotics are fed to farm animals, mostly to fatten them. Fruit growers can also use antibiotics to combat bacterial infections in their crops. In consequence, most Americans consume second-hand antibiotics in their food ... without knowing it.  On some diseases penicillin now has no effect at all. In consequence, the death rate from infectious diseases has been climbing and is back to the level of about forty years ago...... As a doctor put it to me: ‘We are looking at a possibility where we can't do hip replacements or other routine procedures because the risk of infection is too high.’ The day when people die once again from the scratch of a rose thorn may not be far away. Antibiotics are about as nuanced as a hand grenade. They wipe out good microbes as well as bad. Increasing evidence shows that some of the good ones may never recover, to our permanent cost. Most people in the Western world, by the time they reach adulthood, have received between five and twenty courses of antibiotics. The effects, it is feared, may be cumulative, with each generation passing on fewer microorganisms than the one before. Producing new drugs is expensive. All but two of the eighteen largest pharmaceutical companies in the world have given up the search for new antibiotics. People take antibiotics for only a week or two. Much better to focus on drugs like statins or antidepressants that people can take more or less indefinitely. 
VITAMINS 
Funk didn't discover vitamins but merely speculated, correctly, as to their existence. But since no one could produce these strange elements, many authorities refused to accept their reality. Sir James Barr, president of the British Medical Association, dismissed them as ‘a figment of the imagination’ There is disagreement over what precisely we do need. In America, the daily recommended dose of vitamin E is 15 milligrams, but in the UK it is 3 to 4 milligrams – a very considerable difference.Even today vitamins are an ill-defined entity. The term describes 13 chemical oddments that we need to function smoothly but are unable to manufacture for ourselves. Though we tend to think of them as closely related, they mostly have little in common apart from being useful to us.
TASTE
Smell is said to account for at least 70 per cent of flavour and maybe even as much as 90 per cent. ""When you eat, most of the aroma reaches you not through your nostrils but by the back staircase of your nasal passage, what is known as the retronasal route – as opposed to the orthonasal route up your nose.Many tests have been done to demonstrate how easily we are fooled with respect to flavour. In a blind taste test at the University of Bordeaux students in the Faculty of Oenology were given two glasses of wine, one red and one white. The wines were actually identical except that one had been made a rich red with an odourless and flavourless additive. The students without exception listed entirely different qualities for the two wines. That wasn't because they were inexperienced or naive. It was because their sight led them to have entirely different expectations, and this powerfully influenced what they sensed when they took a sip from either glass. In exactly the same way, if an orange-flavoured drink is coloured red, you cannot help but taste it as cherry.
APPENDIX
The appendix, has no certain purpose but kills about 80,000 people around the world every year when it ruptures or grows infected..... Now the best thinking is that the appendix serves as a reservoir for gut bacteria. 
TALKING 
It isn't just a big brain that allows us to speak, but an exquisite arrangement of anatomy. One reason chimpanzees can't talk is that they appear to lack the ability to make subtle shapes with tongue and lips to form complex sounds. The bottom line is that we ended up with brains big enough to handle complex thoughts and vocal tracts uniquely able to articulate them."" Stuttering affects 1 per cent of adults and 4 per cent of children. For reasons unknown, 80 per cent of sufferers are male. It is more common among left-handers than right-handers, especially those who have been made to write right-handed. For many, the stammering miraculously ceases when they sing their words, speak in a foreign language or talk to themselves. The majority of speakers recover from the condition by their teenage years and females seem to recover more easily than men .
STROKES 
Most other mammals never suffer strokes, and for those that do it is a rare event. But for humans, it is the second most common cause of death globally, according to the World Health Organization. Why this should be is something of a mystery. 
BLEEDING PEOPLE
The 18th & 19th centuries were very bad....medicine sank into a kind of dark age. You could hardly imagine more misguided and counterproductive practices than those to which physicians became attached in the eighteenth century, and even much of the nineteenth.Bleeding people was one of those aberrations. It may seem to us self-evidently foolhardy to bleed and pummel a person who is already severely ill, but such practices lasted an extraordinarily long time. Bleeding was thought to be beneficial not just for illness, but to instil calm. Frederick the Great of Germany was bled before battle just to soothe his jangled nerves. Bleeding bowls were treasured within families and passed on as heirlooms.... Why did bleeding persist for so long? The answer is that until well into the nineteenth century most doctors approached diseases not as distinct afflictions, each requiring its own treatment, but as generalized imbalances affecting the whole body. They didn't give one drug for headaches and another for, say, ringing in the ears, but rather endeavoured to bring the whole body back into a state of equilibrium by purging it of toxins through the administration of cathartics, emetics and diuretics, or by relieving the victim of a bowl or two of blood. George Washington was probably killed this way by his doctors.
AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES 
Altogether humans are afflicted by some fifty types of autoimmune disease, and the numbers are rising. Take Crohn's disease... When it was recognised in 1932 it affected on person in 50,000..... Then it became one in 10,000, then one in 5,000. Today the proportion is one in 250 and still rising. Why this has happened no one can say. Daniel Lieberman suggests that the overuse of antibiotics and the consequent depletion of our microbial reserves may have made us more susceptible to all autoimmune diseases, but acknowledges that the 'causes remain elusive'. Equally bewildering is that autoimmune diseases are grossly sexist..... Altogether, 80 per cent of all autoimmune diseases occur in women. Hormones are the presumed culprit but how exactly female hormones trip up the immune system when male hormones don't is not at all clear. 
SMOKING 
A person who smokes cigarettes regularly (about a pack a day) is fifty times more likely than a non-smoker to get cancer.... Yet it took for ever to gain consensus that smoking caused lung cancer. It seems crazy to us today but it wasn't so crazy to people back then. The problem was that a huge proportion of people smoked – 80 per cent of all men by the late 1940s – yet only some of them developed lung cancer. And some people who didn't smoke also developed lung cancer. So it was not especially straightforward to see a direct link between smoking and cancer. When lots of people are doing something and only some of them are dying from it, it makes it hard to impute blame to a single cause. Things have changed. Today just 18 per cent of Americans smoke and it is easy to think that we have pretty much solved the problem. But it's not quite as simple as that. Nearly one-third of people below the poverty line still smoke, and the habit continues to account for one-fifth of all deaths. It is a problem we are a long way from rectifying. 
BACTERIA 
""According to one study, the number of bacteria on you actually rises after a bath or shower because they are flushed out from nooks and crannies.The problem with antibacterial soaps is that they kill good bacteria on your skin as well as bad. The same is true of hand sanitizers 
As with Bryson's 'A Short History of Almost Everything' I'm amazed by the breadth of research and interviewing he must have done for this book. Add to this his hallmark of being wonderfully readable - and you have a great book. Highly recommended.Later Add: Dr Abigail Zuger, who writes for The New York Times says that the book has several errors. “The Body,”..... is peppered with little errors. Bryson gets all tangled up in the reasons why kidney failure goes arm in arm with hypertension (this is complicated territory, but no, it’s not all about the sodium), and flubs an explanation of Gram staining, the venerable technique for distinguishing some bacteria from others. (It has exactly nothing to do with antibodies.) He says that almost all sensory information is processed in the hypothalamus, but that’s the thalamus he’s talking about. He disses the smallpox vaccine, saying it “doesn’t last.” (That’s complicated too, but in most people it does.) He visits a children’s cancer hospital and notes the tiny bald kids scooting around the wards in go-carts with “breathing tubes” coming out of their nostrils. Actually, those are feeding tubes; kids with breathing tubes are far too sick to scoot.(Link to this got from Carol.'s review)https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."

There is a touch too much repetition for a book of this length to justify, and some of the factoids present a gloomy outlook for modern humankind.

Bryson is back on form with his latest, indulging his layman’s curiosity about how the body works. Now, I read a LOT of medical memoirs and popular science. I’ve read entire books about organ transplantation, sleep, dementia, the blood, the heart, evolutionary defects, surgery and so on, but in many cases these go into more detail than I really need and I can find my interest waning. That never happens here. Without ever being superficial or patronizing his readers, the author gives a comprehensive introduction to every organ and body system, moving briskly between engaging anecdotes from medical history and encapsulated research on everything from gut microbes to cancer treatment.Bryson delights in our physical oddities, and his sense of wonder is infectious. How fantastic that there is such a thing as the Belly Button Biodiversity Project (run by North Carolina State University) that has discovered 1,458 species in bacteria new to science in people’s navels! How astounding that a man hiccupped for 67 years straight! As you’ve likely gathered from his other work, he loves a good statistic, and while this book is full of numbers and percentages, they are accessible rather than obfuscating, and will make you shake your head in amazement.“A study in Switzerland found that flu virus can survive on a banknote for two and a half weeks if it is accompanied by a microdot of snot.”“If you’ve ever wondered why no one wants to kiss you first thing in the morning, it is possibly because your exhalations may contain up to 150 different chemical compounds” including “methyl mercaptan (which smells like very old cabbage), hydrogen sulphide (like rotten eggs), dimethyl sulphide (slimy seaweed)”, etc.“Even with the advantage of clothing, shelter and boundless ingenuity, humans can manage to live on only about 12 per cent of Earth’s land area”“Altogether there are about seven thousand rare diseases – so many that about one person in seventeen in the developed world has one, which isn’t very rare at all. But, sadly, so long as a disease affects only a small number of people it is unlikely to get much research attention. For 90 per cent of rare diseases there are no effective treatments at all.”This is a congenial and persistently cheerful book, even when discussing illness, scientists whose work was overlooked, and the inevitability of death. What I found most sobering was the observation that, having conquered many diseases and extended our life expectancy, we are now overwhelmingly killed by our lifestyle, mostly a poor diet of processed and sugary foods and a lack of exercise – “we are born with the bodies of hunter–gatherers but pass our lives as couch potatoes.”A few specific things I learned:I’ve had a nasty cold for the past two weeks, and this book saved me from making a wasted purchase – I had just put Vitamin C on the shopping list when I read that taking large doses of Vitamin C is ineffectual. That it can cure a cold is an urban myth. Immediately, I crossed it off the list and ate an orange instead.It takes 72 hours for food to move through a woman’s digestive system and be excreted. I’d always assumed that what I was getting rid of was my last meal – so that if I had a bout of diarrhea I could blame it on what I’d just eaten. I’m now curious to know how it works for flatulence: I’m sure that I get instant flatulence after eating chickpeas, lentils, eggs or cheese. But is that just my imagination? Maybe I’m actually observing the effects of a meal from a few days ago.A neat thing to know about cold weather; it makes total sense, but had never occurred to me. “Incidentally, the reason your nose runs in chilly weather is the same reason your bathroom windows run with water in chilly weather. In the case of your nose, warm air from your lungs meets cold air coming into the nostrils and condenses, resulting in a drip.”Favorite passages:“Your body is a universe of mystery. A very large part of what happens on and within it happens for reasons that we don’t know – very often, no doubt, because there are no reasons. Evolution is an accidental process, after all.”“Your brain is you. Everything else is just plumbing and scaffolding.”"

The miracle of human life is not that we are endowed with some frailties but we are not swamped by them. ... You truly are a wonder. But then so, it must be said, is an earthworm. 

And with this elegant turn of sentiment, Bryson embarked on a journey of the human body, from top to bottom and from outside in. Despite its subtitle and seeming breadth, it appeared to me to offer limited value as a user's personal handbook. The bulk of The Body  instead was evenly divided between being an idiosyncratic assortment of medical characters and scientists and a brief introductory course to anatomy and physiology. In regards to its utility as an user's handbook, I can easily summarize its conventional advice:- exercise more; don't be so sedentary- get sufficient sleep- eat more plant-based foods instead of processed, refined, or sugary foods - don't smoke or do drugs and drink alcohol moderately 

As with so much in life, getting the balances right is delicate business. Suicide by lifestyles takes ages.

Bryson's deadpan wit existed side by side with some very gross descriptions of past medical research. So beware if you're squeamish or planning to eat. Bryson mentioned many scientists in the context of Nobel prize winners, both the worthy and the slighted, those robbed by unscrupulous bosses or by ignorant skepticism. Many of these stories were quite old, but they made me realize that our medical advances have been relatively recent, within the past 60 years or so. Some examples of medical quackery (through modern eyes) included brain surgery with kitchenware (icepicks) and the injection of all sorts of liquids and multiple animals' blood directly into human subjects' veins. One stomach- churning account was how in the 1820s the surgeon W. Beaumont tested his subject's partially digested food by tasting it himself to confirm the presence of hydrochloric acid in the human gastrointestinal system. The other example was a very graphic testimony in 1810 by novelist F. Burney undergoing a mastectomy while awake and without anesthesia.The Body succinctly described body parts and their functions and many esoteric bits of knowledge. One myth he quickly dispelled was the self help notion that we only use 10 percent of our brain thus leaving 90 percent as an untapped massive potential. Alas, no, all of our brains are utilized. Bryson was quite clear, however, that many aspects still pose mysteries - from why we hiccup, yawn, or even sleep. The most fascinating chapter to me was about the brain. Humans can truly be idiosyncratic as we don't all see or smell the world the same way. How can we when our individual collection of odorant receptors will lead to differing experiences of smell. And then because of the distance between our optic nerves and brains, the brain forecasts 1/5th of a second in advance. 

... photons of light have no color, sound waves no sound, olfactory molecules no odors. ...All the richness of life is created inside your head. What you see is not what is but what your brain tells you it is, and that's not the same thing at all. ... color isn't a fixed reality but a perception. 

So couple that with the following, and the profound insight explains why race is purely a social construct. 

The paradox of genetics is that we are all very different and yet genetically practically identical. All humans share 99.9 percent of their DNA.""People act as if skin color is a determinant of character when all it is is a reaction to sunlight. Biologically, there is actually no such thing as race - nothing in terms of skin color, facial features, hair type, bone structure or anything else that is a defining quality among peoples."" - Nina Jablonski 

We need to overcome our knee-jerk mental reactions. This alone is sufficient for me to round up my initial 3.5+ star rating to 4 stars."
29,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3060349-karen-r,Rating 5 out of 5,"Bill Bryson’s trademark humor is evident in this fascinating book that provides detailed descriptions of the body, how things function and history of discovery. A big takeaway is that although there have been great strides in what we know about science and medicine, he makes it clear just how much is still unknown about how and why things work. This book would be perfect to serve as a primer for a high school health and wellness course. Thanks to Doubleday Books for the ARC in exchange for my honest review."

31,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1170391-sara,Rating 4 out of 5,"Bill Bryson, as usual, manages to make a difficult and complex topic completely accessible and enjoyable in The Body. Taking the reader on journey from the brain (my favourite chapter), endocrine system down to the lungs and beyond, every chapter is full of interesting facts that will entertain as well as inform.Bryson just seems to have this ability in his writing to make the reader feel as though they're chatting with a friend about a subject that he's so clearly passionate about. It manages to invoke an excitment in the reader that is not easily achieved in lesser authors, who could make the subject too dry. I will say that I wasn't as interested in some chapets as I was in others (homeostasis and equilibrium come to mind) but this never stopped me from reading this fast paced, easy read.Fun fact: I met Bill Bryson when I graduated with my BSc and he's a really nice guy. I'd recommend this to anyone wanting a general overview into the weird and wonderful world of the human body. "

There are so many interesting facts about every single part of the body in here. There are just enough stories and humor added in that it makes the book very readable; it never seems like it is too technical or dry, but keep in mind that it is still a book about body facts. It was very fascinating to learn just how much we don't know about the body and how or why it does what it does. I also found that there were quite a few things that I thought I knew, and I did not.If the topic itself sounds interesting to you then I would definitely recommend it because it is very well written."
33,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david-rubenstein,Rating 5 out of 5,"What a marvelous book! Bill Bryson is one of my favorite authors. His dry wit shines in all of his books. Before reading this book, it was hard for me to imagine what the book would be like. I've read some of Bryson's travel books--all delightful--but I couldn't image what a book about the body would be like. As it turns out, it is a tour book, written in the same style, as a metaphorical tour of the body.Bryson interleaves talking about a lot of facts with interesting and often humorous anecdotes. Every single page is very interesting, even entertaining. There are a few gruesome parts that I simply skipped over. This is not a comprehensive book about the body; Bryson relates interesting facts, lots of trivia, and really skips the details. That is the magic he brings to a very engaging book.I didn't read this book, I listened to the audiobook, as read by the author. Bryson has a pleasant, soft voice. Unlike other narrators with soft voices, this audiobook's audio engineering allowed me to hear and understand the narration distinctly. It is also fun, because Bryson's voice inflections bring out the points he wants to emphasize, and the humor comes out in a perfectly deadpan manner."
34,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20498957-claudia,Rating 4 out of 5,"My first Bryson and will definitely not be the last. I loved the ease and fluence of his writing, the light humor, how he mingles bits and pieces of fun facts. The way I see it, this book is, like it's said in the subtitle, a guide through human body and its functions, not a medical book. Most facts are familiar to all of us, I presume, but there were some things I didn't know about, and were interesting to learn about. It's not a comprehensive guide, not even a very in-depth one, but it was such a pleasure to read. He makes pop science as gripping as a thriller - I couldn't put it down, whenever I got some time off to read.I see a lot of reviews here, some full of praise, some less so, therefore I'll just leave below a few lot of quotes, to have a peek inside the book:We are not perfect by any means, goodness knows. We get impacted molars because we have evolved jaws too small to accommodate all the teeth we are endowed with. We have pelvises too small to pass children without excruciating pain. We are hopelessly susceptible to backache. We have organs that mostly cannot repair themselves. If a zebra fish damages its heart, it grows new tissue. If you damage your heart, well, too bad. Nearly all animals produce their own vitamin C, but we can't. We undertake every part of the process except, inexplicably, the last step, the production of a single enzyme.In 1945, the year that Alexander Fleming won the Nobel Prize, a typical case of pneumococcal pneumonia could be knocked out with forty thousand units of penicillin. Today, because of increased resistance, it can take more than twenty million units per day for many days to achieve the same result. On some diseases, penicillin now has no effect at all. In consequence, the death rate for infectious diseases has been climbing and is back to the level of about forty years ago.The great paradox of the brain is that everything you know about the world is provided to you by an organ that has itself never seen that world. The brain exists in silence and darkness, like a dungeoned prisoner. It has no pain receptors, literally no feelings. It has never felt warm sunshine or a soft breeze. To your brain, the world is just a stream of electrical pulses, like taps of Morse code. And out of this bare and neutral information it creates for you-quite literally creates a vibrant, three-dimensional, sensually engaging universe. Your brain is you. Everything else is just plumbing and scaffolding. The brain takes a long time to form completely. A teenager's brain is only about 80 percent finished (which may not come as a great surprise to the parents of teenagers).Total smell loss is known as anosmia, and partial loss is hyposmia. Somewhere between 2 and 5 percent of people in the world suffer from one or the other, which is a very high proportion. An especially wretched minority experience cacosmia, which is where everything smells like feces, and it is, by all accounts, as horrible as you would imagine. At Monell, they refer to smell loss as ""an invisible disability.""We produce very little saliva while we sleep, which is why microbes can proliferate then and give you a foul mouth to wake to. It is also why brushing your teeth at bedtime is a good idea because it reduces the number of bacteria you go to sleep with. If you've ever wondered why no one wants to kiss you first thing in the morning, it is possibly because your exhalations may contain up to 150 different chemical compounds, not all of them as fresh and minty as we might hope. Among the common chemicals that help to create morning mouth are methyl mercaptan (which smells very like old cabbage), hydrogen sulfide (like rotten eggs), dimethyl sulfide (slimy seaweed), dimethylamine and trimethylamine (rank fish), and the self-explanatory cadaverine.The fact is that odors and flavors are created entirely inside our heads. Think of something delicious-a moist, gooey, warm chocolate brownie fresh from the oven, say. Take a bite and savor the velvety smoothness, the rich heady waft of chocolate that fills your head. Now consider the fact that none of those flavors or aromas actually exist. All that is really going in your mouth is texture and chemicals. It is your brain that reads these scentless, flavorless molecules and vivifies them for your pleasure. Your brownie is sheet music. It is your brain that makes it a symphony.The rise of scholarly dissection coincided with an improvement in the standard of medical and anatomical textbooks. The most influential anatomical work of the period and indeed ever since was Anatomy: Descriptive and Surgical, first published in 1858 in London and known ever since as Gray's Anatomy, after its author, Henry Gray.Because of our frailties, much of our own planet is off-limits to us. Earth may feel like a generally benign and kindly place, but a very large part of it is too cold or hot or arid or lofty for us to live successfully on it. Even with the advantage of clothing, shelter, and boundless ingenuity, humans can manage to live on only about 12 percent of Earth's land area and just 4 percent of the total surface area if you include the seas. It is a sobering thought that 96 percent of our planet is off-limits to us.But then you could nominate Proust as a poster figure for a great many medical conditions because he had a superabundance of them. He suffered from insomnia, indigestion, backaches, headaches, fatigue, dizziness, and crushing ennui. More than anything else, however, he was a slave to asthma. He had his first attack at nine and passed a wretched life thereafter. With his suffering came an acute germ phobia. Before opening his mail, he would have his assistant place it in a sealed box and expose it to formaldehyde vapors for two hours. Wherever he was in the world, he sent his mother detailed daily reports on his sleep, lung function, mental composure, and bowel movements. He was, as you will gather, somewhat preoccupied with his health.A striking marker of just how confused nutrition advice can be was a finding by an advisory committee for the American Heart Association that 37 percent of American nutritionists rate coconut oil-which is essentially nothing but saturated fat in liquid form-as a ""healthy food."" Coconut oil may be tasty, but it is no better for you than a big scoop of deep-fried butter.In 2011, an interesting milestone in human history was passed. For the first time, more people globally died from non-communicable diseases like heart failure, stroke, and diabetes than from all infectious diseases combined. We live in an age in which we are killed, more often than not, by lifestyle. We are in effect choosing how we shall die, albeit without much reflection or insight.The longest-lived person that we know of was Jeanne Louise Calment of Arles, in Provence, who died at the decidedly ripe age of 122 years and 164 days in 1997. She was the first person to reach not only 122 but also 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, and 121. Calment had a leisurely life: her father was a rich shipbuilder and her husband a prosperous businessman. She never worked. She outlived her husband by more than half a century and her only child, a daughter, by sixty-three years. Calment smoked all her life-at the age of 117, when she finally gave up, she was still smoking two cigarettes a day and ate two pounds of chocolate every week but was active up to the very end and enjoyed robust health. Her proud and charming boast in old age was, ""I've never had but one wrinkle, and I'm sitting on it."" Calment was also a beneficiary of one of the most delightfully misjudged deals ever made. In 1965, when she ran into financial difficulties, she agreed to leave her apartment to a lawyer in return for a payment of 2,500 francs a months until she died. Because Calment was then ninety, it seemed a pretty good deal for the lawyer. In fact, it was the lawyer who died first, thirty years after signing the deal, having paid Calment more than 900,000 francs for an apartment he was never able to occupy."

The body is often likened to a machine, but it is so much more than that. It works 24 hours a day for decades without (for the most part) needing regular servicing or the installation of spare parts, runs on water and a few organic compounds, is soft and rather lovely, is accommodatingly mobile and pliant, reproduces itself with enthusiasm, makes jokes, feels affection, appreciates a red sunset and a cooling breeze. How many machines do you know that can do any of that? There is no question about it. You are truly a wonder.
Bill Bryson is another one of those authors that I find myself returning to time and again — because I’m interested in his topics — without actually loving his writing style. Needing an audiobook to occupy me as I tackled a large painting project, I selected The Body: A Guide for Occupants (primarily based on its fourteen hour length) and it fit the bill; filling the time and the empty air around me. In this book, Bryson gives a comprehensive overview of the human body — organ by organ, system by system — describing the contributions made by the long line of scientists who have devoted themselves to human anatomy and adding in the diseases specific to the various body parts and how we have learned to combat them. I probably would have liked this better as a physical book — Bryson narrates this himself and I found his performance a little ponderous and self-satisfied as he repeatedly slowed when approaching the punchlines of the ironic humour that rarely made me smile — but I have to admit that repeatedly Bryson shared facts that made me go, “Wow”. Plenty more wow moments than not — just a few of which I’ve shared below — I’m rounding up to four stars.• In breathing, as in everything in life, the numbers are staggering — indeed fantastical. Every time you breathe, you exhale some 25 sextillion (that’s 2.5 × 1022) molecules of oxygen — so many that with a day’s breathing you will in all likelihood inhale at least one molecule from the breaths of every person who has ever lived. And every person who lives from now until the sun burns out will from time to time breathe in a bit of you. At the atomic level, we are in a sense eternal.• Make no mistake. This is a planet of microbes. We are here at their pleasure. They don’t need us at all. We’d be dead in a day without them.• The great paradox of the brain is that everything you know about the world is provided to you by an organ that has itself never seen that world. The brain exists in silence and darkness, like a dungeoned prisoner. It has no pain receptors, literally no feelings. It has never felt warm sunshine or a soft breeze. To your brain, the world is just a stream of electrical pulses, like taps of Morse code.

In consequence, it was a bad year for flu in America, with a death toll estimated at eighty thousand. In the event of a really catastrophic epidemic — one that killed children or young adults in large numbers, say — Kinch believes we wouldn’t be able to produce vaccine fast enough to treat everyone, even if the vaccine was effective. “The fact is,” he says, “we are really no better prepared for a bad outbreak today than we were when Spanish flu killed tens of millions of people a hundred years ago. The reason we haven’t had another experience like that isn’t because we have been especially vigilant. It’s because we have been lucky.”(I was, in particular, awaiting a passage like that last one; wondering if Bryson would have anticipated our Covid world and he does write prophetically about zoonotic diseases and the likelihood of species-jumping pandemic-causing viruses.) Bryson clears up a bunch of myths — the idea that we use only 10 percent of our brains, that we require 10000 steps or eight glasses of water/day, that MSG causes Chinese Food Syndrome, that all the chemicals that make up our bodies could be bought for pocket change, antioxidants are “a giant racket” that do not combat aging, a daily aspirin is as likely to cause gastrointestinal problems as prevent heart or stroke disease — but the most frustrating aspect of this book (which is not Bryson’s fault) is how very often he describes some aspect of the human body and is forced to add, “and no one knows why”. That we have learned so much about how our bodies work is a marvel; that so much remains mysterious is more marvelous still."

I think this was a brilliant idea!! We live in this body that we are so intimate with and yet could hardly speak of what goes on inside or tell us the functions of the organs we have, nor even name them. Bryson took a Biology Book, that is the last thing I ever want, and turned it to an amazing book that I cannot keep my hands away from. This was simply unputdownable.Converting a daunting and boring science book into an understandable and entertaining book for EVERYONE is like wizardry. His writing is brilliant and truly enjoyable. Bryson kept me intrigued and in awe for the facts and information he magically sprinkled throughout the pages. Additionally, the anecdotes within the chapters made for a really fun read for me. This book had accurate and important information that I did not even learn in my pre-med courses in college. I feel like I can win a trivia contest or even join Jeopardy after reading this book. Bryson wrote a phenomenal book full of amazing information without feeling like I am stuffing my head with information, but for some reason I am retaining these facts and enjoy talking about them to everyone I meet. I have recommended this book to many people already and will continue to do so. What an awesome gift for anyone that can appreciate a great read and feel so much smarter after reading this. Amazing job!Thank you NeyGalley and Double Day Books for the ARC ebook for my honest and objective opinion."
38,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,Rating 4 out of 5,"I am a huge fan of Bill Bryson's travel books - he is a superb storyteller, and in the best parts of his science writing, this ability to provide fascinating facts and intriguing tales shines through.After taking on the whole of science in his first book, here he focuses in on the physiology, anatomy and diseases of the human body. Bryson does so with his usual light, approachable style, peppering the plethora of facts (and 'don't know's - it's amazing how much we still don't know about the workings of the body) with the little nuggets you can't help but share and stories of some of the odd and, frankly, horrifying goings on in the history of medicine.So, for example, Bryson throws in 'The chin is unique to humans and no one knows why we have one.' He speculates that it might be just that we 'find a good chin dashing' and quotes a Harvard professor as saying 'Testing this last hypothesis is especially difficult, but the reader is encouraged to think of appropriate experiments.'It's a long time since I read Bryson's first science book, but I suspect that his Short History of Nearly Everything involved more going and talking to scientists, so had more of the feel of a documentary, and more opportunity to bring in his travel writing skills. Here, there was more of a focus on presentation of facts, though always in a way that felt more like a conversation with a friend than an introductory textbook on human biology - and there are still a number of interviews.A good example of the way Bryson goes about exploring a topic is the way he deals with asthma. He starts with a story about the writer Marcel Proust, describing the many ways that Proust attempted to treat the condition, including enemas, opium and having the gas to his house cut off. From Proust we move on to the way asthma has become more prevalent and the remarkable variation around the world - not, as you might expect, paralleling the degree of air pollution. It was shocking to read that the highest rate in the world is in the UK, where '30 per cent of children have shown asthma symptoms in the last year.' This is compared with rates around 3 percent in China, Greece, Romania and Russia. He then goes on, using an interview with an expert at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, to show how most of our ideas about asthma are wrong. For example, he quotes Neil Pearce as saying 'the main thing I have achieved is to show that almost none of the things people think cause asthma actually do.'Along the way Bryson takes us on a tour of the body, starting with 'the outside' (skin and hair) and working through all the main parts, the vast numbers of microbes that share our body, body functions - such as movement, eating and sleep - and diseases, finishing with a whole chapter on cancer and another on the way that medicine has developed from doing more harm than good to its present state.This is the perfect book for anyone (like me) who had little to do with biology at school and to whom much of the functioning of human anatomy is a mystery. You know that with Bryson at the helm, the voyage through your inner workings is bound to be fascinating and entertaining. I wish there had been more opportunity for his humour and recounting personal adventures, as in his travel books, because this is where Bryson is at his best - but even when recounting facts he keeps the reader interested, never lingering long enough to get bogged down.Well worth a look."

I also learned enough fascinating trivia which I plan to spring on unsuspecting friends at inappropriate times for my own entertainment.My favorite sections dealt with the microbiome, gut and nervous system and to be honest any book that incorporates something like the Belly Button Diversity Project would grab my attention.I found it amusing that he treaded so lightly and diplomatically in the nutrition and vaccine section but then again there is currently a lot of controversy in these areas.The author also quoted some of my favorite books by Mary Roach as well as sections of The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancerto just name a few so even with my slightly middle of the road rating I can highly recommend this to anyone who has a passing interest in well researched books that make medical speak accessible and learning new things fun."

41,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8111350-kendra,Rating 2 out of 5,"It's nice to read a new book by Bryson in which he seems to have gotten over the bitterness (especially about aging) that made several of his most recent books unpleasant. And while The Body is written in something similar to his old, familiar, entertaining style, there are several issues that will keep me from buying it for friends. 1. it's hard to be precisely up-to-the-minute with books on science, but a lot of the data Bryson cites is quite old and misleading. Referring to the BMI, for example, is problematic because it is known to be a terrible indicator of, well, anything, and it's been long-condemned by medical professionals. There are other errors of fact as well: it's ""Down syndrome,"" not ""Down's,,"" for example. 2. It's ableist and sexist. The book could have used a sensitivity reading by a disabled person, who would have asked Bryson to remove a lot of the language of ""suffering"" and ""lack"" that appears. Bryson often refers to measurements and statistics about women by citing men first and then portraying women as the different or other. Although he does an excellent job of pointing out gender bias in scientific studies, his framing is redolent of those studies themselves. 3. It's not really necessary: as Bryson himself cites numerous other, recent books about the human body and human health, it's unclear why he though his addition was needed. Sure, the historical anecdotes are interesting, but they've been used numerous other times in other books on the same topic."

Reading through this book by Bill Bryson, is like talking to your favorite uncle at the Thanksgiving table, after everyone else went to watch the football game. You and he are nibbling dessert, sipping coffee and just chatting about the human body. That’s how easy the writing flows.So far from any textbook, it contains valuable facts yet it’s not overly technical. The categories or elements of the vast network that contains the wonders inside and out are organized perfectly; and the technical words are available for anyone who wants them. Just when you’re ready to ask, ‘but what about this?’ Bill segues into that area. Always the teacher and the guide, Bryson just knows what to tell us next. He presents not just the basic information, but any controversies, recent and past, surrounding this body part or organ relative to disease or maladies. I’ve learned more through this book than I have reading articles or other periodicals over the past year or so.

48,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6326169-negin,Rating 3 out of 5,"I adore Bill Bryson’s travelogues. Those often had me laughing to the point of tears. I wish that I could focus more on his fact-based books. These days, I truly struggle with focusing on pretty much anything. There were parts of this book that were interesting. I enjoyed the stories and anecdotes far more than all the facts and details, few of which I will remember anyway. Those parts bored me a bit, and at times I felt as if I was reading a textbook or an extremely lengthy article in “National Geographic”. Here are some of my favorite quotes/facts:8 Glasses“The conviction that we should all drink eight glasses of water a day is the most enduring of dietary misunderstandings. The idea has been traced to a 1945 paper from the U.S. Food and Nutrition Board, which noted that that was the amount that the average person consumed in a day. ‘What happened,’ Dr. Stanley Goldfarb of the University of Pennsylvania told the BBC radio program More or Less in 2017, ‘was that people sort of confused the idea that this was the required intake. And the other confusion that occurred was then people said that it is not so much that you should take in eight ounces eight times a day, but that you should consume that in addition to whatever fluid you consume in association with your diet and your meals. And there was never any evidence for that.’”10% Myth“… the idea that we use only 10 percent of our brains is a myth. No one knows where the idea came from, but it has never been true or close to true. You may not use it all terribly sensibly, but you employ all your brain in one way or another.”After Death“It is a myth, and physiological impossibility, incidentally, that hair and nails continue to grow after death. Nothing grows after death.”Amazing!“Your lungs, smoothed out, would cover a tennis court, and the airways within them would stretch nearly from coast to coast. The length of all your blood vessels would take you two and a half times around Earth. The most remarkable part of all is your DNA (or deoxyribonucleic acid). You have a meter of it packed into every cell, and so many cells that if you formed all the DNA in your body into a single strand, it would stretch ten billion miles, to beyond Pluto. Think of it: there is enough of you to leave the solar system. You are in the most literal sense cosmic.”Antioxidants and Free Radicals“Two other terms encountered commonly, if no more productively, in discussions of aging are ‘free radicals’ and ‘antioxidants.’ Free radicals are wisps of cellular waste that build up in the body in the process of metabolism. They are a by-product of our breathing oxygen. As one toxicologist has put it, ‘The biochemical price of breathing is aging.’ Antioxidants are molecules that neutralize free radicals, so the thinking is that if you take a lot of them in the form of supplements, you can counter the effects of aging. Unfortunately, there is no scientific evidence to support that. Most of us would almost certainly never have heard of either free radicals or antioxidants if a research chemist in California named Denham Harman had not, in 1945, read an article about aging in his wife’s Ladies’ Home Journal and developed a theory that free radicals and antioxidants are at the heart of human aging. Harman’s idea was never anything more than a hunch, and subsequent research proved it to be wrong, but nonetheless the idea has taken hold and will not go away. The sale of antioxidant supplements alone is now worth well over $2 billion a year. ‘It is a massive racket,’ David Gems of University College London told Nature in 2015. ‘The reason the notion of oxidation and ageing hangs around is because it is perpetuated by people making money out of it.’ ‘Some studies have even suggested that antioxidant supplements can be harmful,’ The New York Times has noted. The principal learned journal of the field, Antioxidants and Redox Signaling, noted in 2013 that ‘antioxidant supplementation did not lower the incidence of many age-associated diseases but, in some cases, increased the risk of death.’”Childhood Asthma “… people who had had a cat early in life seemed to derive lifelong protection from getting asthma.”“In what way exactly Western lifestyles might provoke asthma isn’t easy to say. Growing up on a farm seems to protect you, and moving to the city increases your risk, but once again we don’t really know why. One intriguing theory, suggested by Thomas Platts-Mills of the University of Virginia, links asthma increases with children spending less time running around outdoors. As Platts-Mills has noted, children used to play outside after school. Now more often than not they go indoors and stay there. ‘We now have a population that sits around the house and sits still in ways that children have never sat still before,’ he told the journal Nature. Children who sit watching television not only are not exercising their lungs as they would if they were at play but even breathe differently from children who are not transfixed by a screen. Specifically, children who are reading take deeper breaths and sigh more often than children watching TV, and that slight difference in respiratory activity may be enough to increase TV watchers’ susceptibility to asthma, according to this theory.”Choking“It is more probable that a lot of choking deaths are misattributed as heart attacks. Suspecting as much, a coroner in Florida named Robert Haugen many years ago looked into the deaths of people who had supposedly died of heart attacks in restaurants and, without much difficulty, found nine who had in fact choked. In an article for The Journal of the American Medical Association, he suggested that choking deaths were much more common than generally thought. But even using the most cautious estimates, choking is the fourth most common cause of accidental death in America today.”Common Cold“The only really reliable way to transfer cold germs is physically by touch.”Dying of Old Age? Not so Fast!“Getting old is the surest route to dying. In the Western world, 75 percent of deaths from cancer, 90 percent from pneumonia, 90 percent from flu, and 80 percent from all causes occur in people sixty-five years of age or older. Interestingly, in the United States no one has died of old age since 1951, at least not officially, for in that year old age was banished as a cause from death certificates. In Britain, it is still allowed, though not much used.”Finding a Cure“By one calculation, if we found a cure for all cancers tomorrow, it would add just 3.2 years to overall life expectancy. Eliminating every last form of heart disease would add only 5.5 years. That’s because people who die of these things tend to be old already, and if cancer or heart disease doesn’t get them, something else will. Of nothing is that more true than Alzheimer’s disease. Eradicating it altogether, according to the biologist Leonard Hayflick, would add just nineteen days to life expectancy.”Fingerprints“The idea that all fingerprints are unique is actually a supposition. No one can say for absolute certain that no one else has fingerprints to match yours. All that can be said is that no one has yet found two sets of fingerprints that precisely match.”Food-Borne Illnesses“The largest source of foodborne illness is not meat or eggs or mayonnaise, as commonly supposed, but green leafy vegetables. They account for one in five of all food illnesses.”Longevity“… reaching 80 is largely a consequence of following a healthy lifestyle, but after that it is almost entirely a matter of genes. Or as Bernard Starr, a professor emeritus at City University of New York, put it, ‘The best way to assure longevity is to pick your parents.’”“The chances of reaching your 110th birthday are about one in seven million. It helps a lot to be a woman; they are ten times more likely to reach 110 than a man. … The longest-lived person that we know of was Jeanne Louise Calment of Arles, in Provence, who died at the decidedly ripe age of 122 years and 164 days in 1997. She was the first person to reach not only 122 but also 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, and 121. Calment had a leisurely life: her father was a rich shipbuilder and her husband a prosperous businessman. She never worked. She outlived her husband by more than half a century and her only child, a daughter, by sixty-three years. Calment smoked all her life—at the age of 117, when she finally gave up, she was still smoking two cigarettes a day—and ate two pounds of chocolate every week but was active up to the very end and enjoyed robust health. Her proud and charming boast in old age was, ‘I’ve never had but one wrinkle, and I’m sitting on it.’”Mites“Right now, grazing in the divots on your head (and elsewhere on your oily surface, but above all on your head) are tiny mites called Demodex folliculorum. They are generally harmless, thank goodness, as well as invisible. They have lived with us for so long that according to one study their DNA can be used to track the migrations of our ancestors from hundreds of thousands of years ago. At their scale, your skin to them is like a giant crusty bowl of cornflakes. If you close your eyes and use your imagination, you can almost hear the crunching.”Sensitivity to Dying“We are extraordinarily sensitive about dying, it seems, and often take the most desperate steps to put off the inevitable. Almost everywhere, overtreatment of dying people is routine. Among those dying of cancer in America, one in eight receives chemotherapy right up to the last two weeks of their lives, long past the point where it is effective. Three separate studies have shown that cancer sufferers receiving palliative care in their final weeks rather than chemotherapy actually live longer and suffer much less.”Skin“The outermost surface of the epidermis, called the stratum corneum, is made up entirely of dead cells. It is an arresting thought that all that makes you lovely is deceased. Where body meets air, we are all cadavers. These outer skin cells are replaced every month. We shed skin copiously, almost carelessly: some twenty-five thousand flakes a minute, over a million pieces every hour. Run a finger along a dusty shelf, and you are in large part clearing a path through fragments of your former self. Silently and remorselessly we turn to dust.”We are Eternal“… with a day’s breathing you will in all likelihood inhale at least one molecule from the breaths of every person who has ever lived. And every person who lives from now until the sun burns out will from time to time breathe in a bit of you. At the atomic level, we are in a sense eternal.”"

(Paywalled. As always, I'm happy to email a copy to non-subscribers) ""According to Mr. Bryson, “running—serious, dogged, long-distance running—is the one thing we do superlatively well.” Our ancestors, with their big frontal lobes, social natures and marathoner builds, were perfectly adapted for co-operative persistence hunting. “We are not the speediest of creatures . . . but put us up against an antelope or a wildebeest on a hot day and allow us trot after it, and we can run it into the ground.”Being vertical has drawbacks. Our backs, hips and knees wear out with age. Our sinuses drain poorly and become viral cesspools every winter. And “we choke to death more easily than any other mammal.” To keep our big heads upright, our necks became longer and more centered under the skull. This had the happy side effect of making speech, and the vocal stylings of Aretha Franklin, possible. Unfortunately, it made our airways more vulnerable to accidental blockages by boluses of food."""

I found myself making little noises of surprise (huh!) throughout the first few chapters. There is a lot of interesting tidbits about biology and anatomy and all the other -ologies. Bryson brings his signature style of retelling fascinating and long-forgotten stories of the people who made scientific breakthroughs throughout history. These are the moments where Bryson really shines.Bryson's science writing does get a bit repetitive and dry towards the end, and increasingly abrupt. It does make the last quarter or fifth of this book a little bit of a slog.However, I had to knock this book down a star because Bryson's obsession with weight is truly distracting. It truly feels like he takes every opportunity, whether sensical or not, to comment on how fat we're all getting and how it's going to kill us all. I found this incredibly outdated and tone deaf, especially since much of the data he uses has been proven false, and his general tone is one of: fat people are lazy and sit down all day and if they just lived sensibly (this is verbatim, btw; ""sensibly"") then he wouldn't have to be burdened by writing about us jiggly fat lards. (Which seems rich coming from him since he, himself, is not known for being particularly svelt...but that's none of my business.) Every time I thought he was done with the fat shaming, he found another completely unnecessary moment to drop in how fat people are ill and miserable and are causing their own deaths. It truly infected a lot of the last 2/3rds of this book and was a ginormous wet blanket on this book for me.*Has anyone even said couch potato since 1998?"

Nežinojot? Nieko tokio. Apie kūną ir jo veiklas mes tiek daug nežinome, nesuprantame ir nenutuokiame, kad neaišku, kad gąsdina labiau – visa informacija, kurią jau spėjome per tiek amžių įsisąmoninti, ar ta, kuri dar tik laukia, kol bus atrasta.Nepaprastai, net sakyčiau, kad išskirtinai smagi mokslo populiarinimo knyga. Juokinga, rodos, beveik be pastangų, plaukianti lengvai ir įtraukiančiai, visus faktus papildant tokio smagumo istorijomis ir pavyzdžiais, kad didžiąją laiko dalį skaitai su šypsena, o vėliau imi kikent į ūsą. Ir pasakotojas toks linksmas seneliokas, į nieką nežiūrintis per daug rimtai, pats užveda tuo savo kikenimu – kaip žmogus, kuris bando papasakot bajerį, bet negali kalbėt nesijuokdamas, tai pats pradedi juoktis, nors dar net negirdėjai bajerio pabaigos. Aišku, čia viskas tokiam popso lygmeny, tikrai ne jokiems medicinos ar biologijos entuziastams ar tuo labiau ekspertams, bet kas smagiausia, kad Brysonas sugeba įtraukti ne tik istorijomis apie reprodukciją, kurios gi vartant biologijos vadovėlį visiem buvo įdomiausios ir tos, kurias atsiverti pirmiausia. Tai nors čia ir yra kelios „cha cha, papai, cha cha, bezdalai“ tipo istorijos, šiaip viskas gana subtiliai ir su geru humoru. O svarbiausia, kad kiekvienam puslapy jaučiasi tai, KIEK darbo į šitą knygą buvo įdėta. Tiesa, knyga nesunku persisotinti, bet tik tuo atveju, jei ji vartojama per dideliais kiekiais. Keli skyriai per vakarą – optimaliausias reikalas ir garantuotas pakikenimo užtaisas prieš miegą. Autorius neišvengia informacijos pasikartojimų, bet man tas visai netrukdė – kai skaičiau knygą su pertraukomis maždaug mėnesį, buvo visai neblogai, kad tam tikri dalykai buvo vis primenami iš naujo. Ir kaip bebūtų keista, nuobodžiausiai skaitėsi dalys apie ligas – rodos, dalykas įdomus, bet Brysonas neišvengė daug neįdomios statistikos ir tokių savaime suprantamų padejavimų, iš serijos: „sergant apsimoka būti turtingu“, „žmonių gyvenimo trukmė vis ilgėja!!” ir „ligų populiarumas bėgant metams vis keičiasi“, o tokių išvadų kituose skyriuose tikrai buvo išvengta. Kaip bebūtų, skaitinys pasirodė linksmas ir turtingas informacija, o ir visokiais smagiais faktais, kuriuos vėliau galima pasakoti per vakarėlius, atrodyti sąmojingam ir visai protingam. Skaitysiu Billo Brysono knygų daugiau – neabejotinai!

There are biographies of investigators who actually discovered how this or that body part worked. Some stories are sad and others are fascinating.Being a patient in the early middle ages when a doctor didn’t know exactly what was happening because the doctor used best practices developed from ancient Greek texts and cures taught to him by other doctors, like bleeding a patient of quarts of blood, often cured the disease by killing the patient. It was quite a thrilling adventure to require medical care until almost the middle of the twentieth century!The audience that will most enjoy the book is the general reader. Bryson writes of what some people would consider icky biology and history without much ick. A slight tongue-in-cheek grin helps the reader slide over those parts where proto-physicians and scientists really screwed up their patients because of erroneous conclusions, cures and operations. After all, every failure often meant the next patient might survive longer because of fewer mistakes and increased knowledge. That’s good, right? Many of us today have survived terrible illnesses and operations because of all those people doctors killed in the past! Wait, sorry, that didn’t come out right….The chapters are:-How to Build a Human-The Outside: Skin and Hair-Microbial You-The Brain-The Head-Down the Hatch: The Mouth and Throat-The Heart and Blood-The Chemistry Department-In the Dissecting Room: The Skeleton-On the Move: Bipedalism and Exercise-Equilibrium-The Immune System-Deep Breath: The Lungs and Breathing -Food, Glorious Food-The Guts-Sleep-Into the Nether Regions-In the Beginning: Conception and Birth-Nerves and Pain-When Things Go Wrong: Diseases-When Things Go Very Wrong: Cancer-Medicine Good and Bad-The EndThere are extensive Notes on Sources and Bibliography sections.

59,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70265878-aurelia,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a very light popular science reading. It is an excellent introduction to human physiology for people with no background in biology and who had not previously dug up some of these topics out of ignorance and curiosity. Complicated concepts are kept at the appropriate minimum. The author clearly targets laymen as he describes how our bodies function at the most trivial and mundane moments of our lives, trying his best to connect what most people consider a highly sophisticated science beyond their capacities to everyday life. And he does so in an eloquent and sometimes humorous manner.The book is divided into sections each covering a system of the human body. We find descriptions of its workings; history of how we came to understand it, few anecdotes about how that came about, and finally the most prominent disturbances in its functions it could suffer, particularly with our modern lifestyle and diet. What keeps coming out from each section is the cheer ignorance humans lived in for most of their History when it comes to the workings of their bodies. The human body is a miracle but a highly inaccessible one. The theories of Greek physicians were all what the western world practiced medicine with, and it was impossible to go any further without horrifying pains or death. So experimenting was not very common. It took tremendous efforts to describe organs, determine the role and understand the workings of the most basic bodily functions which now to us are primary school knowledge. Only dead bodies can be studied, reconstructing the functioning of the whole system out of a corpse was outstanding genius.Further than that was the complexity of the chemistry involved in even the tiniest units of the human body. This has become a field of its own, on which a new understanding of what we call life was built. Of course the big breakthroughs had to wait until the XX century. The human body is a chemical powerhouse; the language with which it communicates with itself, and also with the exterior world, arises from the infinite combinations and recombination of chemical elements. What is remarkable is that even with our modern tools in chemistry, not all of this is entirely understood.Today, not all people have to bury their infants because of a fever. And for those who have to go through this in the XXI century it is quite possible that they will live it at the most cruel injustice in the world, perhaps curse the gods for the rest of their lives, completely oblivious of the fact that infant mortality was the normal order of things just a century ago, Louis Pasteur burying three of his children. Sure modern medicine transformed the way humans exist on this planet. However, our understanding of pathogens and how the body reacts to them is still limited. Perhaps the chaos in which the Coronavirus throwed the world in an instant is a good reminder. Nature comes back to reassure itself as the infinite potential, humans being just one of its most humble materializations.The case is especially problematic for us laymen. We read about studies conducted, techniques developed or new discoveries made in this university or that, and take its results with apodictic certainty. As fitness and healthy diet culture become widespread, our enthusiasm for staying young and living long approaches hubris.  In surveying the history of some practices in both the distant and the recent past, the author aims at inspiring a little moderation and self-restraint. Modern medicine is still a human medicine, and it suffers from human biases and shortcomings. A lot of our beliefs about the good and bad for our health can have for a source in some popular book or some successful advertising campaign. Even those who study the matter in a rigorously scientific way can disagree on fundamentals. The History of medicine is full of practices which endured for centuries although they had no results and left only devastated victims behind. Nothing can guarantee that our chemotherapy, corticosteroids and anti-depressants will be remembered with the same horror we remember XVIII centuries bleedings, XIX century opioids syrups and XX century lobotomies…"

Not really, to be honest.I learned a few things here and there that I didn't know (hormones are even made in our bones!), but overall it was a reading experience that was helped along by his writing and humor.There are multiple times, practically in each chapter that he makes the statement ""fact fact fact...and no one is exactly sure why?"". That in itself makes you think.In summary, Bryson's facts and anecdotes give you: an overall sense of being in this world, educate you on just about every topic there is when it comes to your body and causes a sense of panic and a few funny faces while you read things you'd rather not know.

Fascinating, informative, somewhat alarming and horrifying at times - such as the case of Fanny Burney, who in 1810 at the age of 58, underwent a radical mastectomy without anaesthesia, she not only lived long enough afterwards to write a detailed, stomach churning account of her ordeal but went on to survive another 29 years. I found it somewhat unsettling to learn how much doctors still don't know and the cheery news that it's only a matter of time before a really cracking flu pandemic decimates mankind 😬.

As Bryson writes, “We pass our existence within this warm wobble of flesh and yet take it entirely for granted.” We are the product of three billion years of evolutionary refinement, a biological machine of unimagined complexity, and yet most of us can’t even identify where the spleen is, or what it does.If this book doesn’t pique your interest in how your body works, then nothing probably will. Bryson takes the reader through each body system, describing the anatomy and physiology of each, but also providing historical information, expert interviews, and biographical details on the pioneers of medical discovery. Bryson, as usual, writes in an informative and entertaining way, presenting information in clever ways (for example, when he states that a portion of your cerebral cortex the size of a grain of sand can hold 1.2 billion copies of this book.) The book is filled with calculations and analogies like this to help the reader better contextualize the information.I also appreciate how Bryson doesn’t mindlessly repeat the cliches we always here without doing his research. It’s commonly stated that we only use 10 percent of our brains, or that our body contains 10 times as many bacterial cells as human cells. It turns out that these statements, among many others, are false, and Bryson shows you why. He doesn’t take anything for granted and researches all such claims.You will also come to understand—not only how much you don’t understand about the body—but also how much of the body no one understands. The body is unfathomably complex, and many areas and functions remain mysterious. If I had to say anything negative about the book, it would be the lack of illustrations. Some diagrams would be helpful, especially on the sections covering anatomy, as it’s hard to visualize the structures as he’s describing them. Also, don’t expect to dive too deeply into the functioning of each body system—the details are selective and you’re going to get equal measures of the history behind the discoveries. This is not a bad thing, as long as you’re expecting it. Overall, this is probably the best popular book on the subject, and a good entry point for further study in anatomy, physiology, human evolution, or medicine."

Definitively a 5 stars for me, a permanent place on my shelf and I would highly recommend it to everyone around me.I listened to the Audiobook version narrated by Brill Bryson himself, I also have a physical copy of the paperback and I am glad because I will surely be coming back to it and re-read some parts in the future.

""If you are cremated, your ashes will weigh about 2 kilos. And that's you gone. But it was good while it lasted, wasn't it?""
Ovo su poslednje tri rečenice, koje odlično daju osećaj tokom čitanja Tela. Ima tu dosta interesantnih činjenica. Da, te činjenicu su često trivijalne i brzo ćeš ih zaboraviti. Na primer: dnevno trepnemo 14,000 puta. Ukupna težina kože je 5-7 kg, a težina kostiju tek nešto veća, oko 10. Od trenutka kad si počeo da čitaš ovu rečenicu, tvoje telo je proizvelo milion crvenih krvnih zrnaca. Ali ipak, podaci su dobro istraženi, nalaze se na mestima koja bi bez njih zvučala suvoparna i daju jasnije objašnjenje biologiji ljudskog tela. Tri najbolje knjige koje na par stotina strana objašnjavaju obimnu nauku, za mene su Hararijev Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, The Second World War Antony Beevora i Brajsonova Kratka istorija bezmalo svačega. Za nekoga ko je u materiji, verovatno ponekad suviše pojednostavljuju stvari, ali tome se mora pribeći da bi se ostao jasan i koncizan. Telo možda nije na njihovom nivou, ali nije ni preterano daleko. Može poslužiti kao uvod za nekoga ko nije voleo da sluša o tome u školi (taj sam) ili kao uvod u dalje čitanje. Mada, čak i da samo Telo pročitaš više puta, nećeš pogrešiti.Dalje... pribeleške, više za mene, dok ne nestane papirić na kom su zapisane:Telo je čudesan stroj. Svaki dan 1 od 5 naših ćelija postane rakava, ali imuni sistem radi toliko dobro da ih odmah uništi.Imuni sistem je generalno neverovatna mašina. Svaki dan naše telo napada na stotine alergija i bolesti. Imuni sistem proverava da li te je napalo nešto na šta si imun. Kad dobije tu informaciju, ""poziva"" ćelije koje imaju taj imunitet, one dolaze na mesto napada i uništavaju uljeza. I ako nisi imun, stvari rešava neobjašnjivo efikasno. Znamo za više od 100,000 virusa koji napadaju čoveka. Zbog toga nikad nećeš postati imun na prehladu.Antibiotici su čudo i pored vakcine verovatno najveća stvar u istoriji medicine. Ali preterano korišćenje antibiotika nije štetno samo zato što štete našem telu, već i zato što se virusi prebrzo navikavaju na njih i mutiraju da bi preživeli. Ne samo da ih lekari prepisuju i kad treba i kad ne treba (od 40 miliona antibiotika godišnje u SAD, skoro 3/4 se daju za bolesti koje se ne mogu lečiti njima), već ih dosta konzumiramo i kroz meso životinja kojima se daju za vreme ""proizvodnje"". U Evropi je korišćenje antibiotike u te svrhe zabranjeno. (Hm, kako je kod nas?)Svake godine na jedan nov antibiotik, 2 antibiotika izađu iz upotrebe, pošto su postali neefikasni. Farmaceutskim kompanijama ne isplati se više da razvijaju nove. Razvoj je skup, lekovi brzo postanu neefikasni, a kad ih uzimaš, uzimaš ih kratko vreme, pa je zarada po pacijentu niska. Od 18 velikih kompanija, samo 2 još rade na razvoju novih antibiotika. Postoji realna opasnost da će nestati antibiotici, što bi bio veliki problem. “The day when people once again die from the scratch of a rose thorn may not be far away.” Šta umesto njih? Virusi kao lekovi je jedna od zanimljivijih ideja. Mozak procesuira za 30 sekundi više informacija nego Hablov teleskop za 30 godina.Svi znamo šta smo radili i gde smo bili na bitne datume - na primer početak bombardovanja Srbije ili 11. septembra. Međutim, mozak radi čudno. Istraživanje je pokazalo da se polovina ljudi vara, pobrka uspomene i da se pogrešno seća šta je zaista radila u tim trenucima.Informacija da koristimo 10% svog mozga je mit.Jedna od čudnijih bolesti mozga je na primer da vidiš samo objekte koji su u pokretu. Postoji i stanje u kom su bolesnici uvereni da se ljudi koje oni dobro poznaju, ustvari pretvaraju i da su lažni. A možda najčudniji su ljudi koji čvrsto veruju da su mrtvi i nikako se ne mogu uveriti u suprotno. Otac lobotomije Freeman, psihijatar a ne hirurg, izvodio je operacije 40 godina. Na jednoj od turneja je za 12 dana izveo 225 operacija. Većina je izvođena na brutalan način, na primer zabijanjem šila kroz oko ""pacijenta"". Praksa je bila priznata u svetu, izvodila se masovno, a iznenađuje da je uprkos varvarskom pristupu 1/3 operacija bila uspešna. Umrlo je samo 2% ljudi na kojima je lobotomija izvođena.15 do 20% ljudi koji su u komi je verovatno potpuno svesno, ali ne mogu da reaguju na okolinu.50% mladih ispod 30 godina, radije bi se odreklo čula mirisa nego svoje omiljene tehnološke spravice.U Americi je od 2000. do danas 800 dece umrlo nakon što su bila ostavljena u kolima na parkingu. Ostavljanje životinja u kolima je zabranjeno u 29 američkih država, ostavljanje dece u 21 državi.Šta prouzrukuje astmu? Najčešće ne ono što mislimo. Zagađenje vazduha, na primer, može da uzrokuje napad astme, ali ne i njen nastanak. Većina ljudi dobije astmu zbog alergije. Koliko traje da hrana koju pojedeš izađe iz tela? Odgovori mojih ukućana: između 4-8h. Istina je više od 3 dana (kod muškaraca desetak sati manje nego kod žena). Hrana provede 4-6h u želucu, 6-8h u malom crevu i onda skoro 3 dana u debelom crevu.Da li je san greška evolucije? Naučnici ne mogu da pronađu zbog čega ustvari spavamo, pošto iste efekte postižemo i budnim odmaranjem. Ipak, ljudi umru ako ne spavaju. Zanimljivo je da se noću budimo često, i po dvadesetak puta tokom onih noći kad smo smatrali da smo spavali bez prekida. Žena već kao fetus ima sva jajašca koja će imati tokom života. U 20. nedelji razvoja fetusa, njih je oko 6 miliona. Do rođenja, njihov broj padne na milion. U dobi sazrevanja taj broj je oko 180,000 i brzo pada. Do 35. godine starosti, izgubljeno je 95% svih jajašca.Rak: ""Your body doing its best to kill you. Suicide without permission."" Virusi uzrokuju skoro četvrtinu svih kancera. Rak je cena evolucije. Radi se o mutacijama ćelija, tako da ukoliko ne bi bilo evolucije, ne bi bilo ni raka.75% muškaraca iznad 65 godina umre sa rakom prostate, ali većina to ni ne zna i naravno, ne umre od toga. Kažu da bi rak prostate dobio svaki muškarac koji bi živeo dovoljno dugo.Medicina čudesno napreduje, pa i poslednjih 30 godina, iako nam se to možda ne čini. Ima naravno još uvek mnogo nedostataka, jedan od najvećih je profit po svaku cenu farmaceutskih kompanija, što pogubno utiče na prakse rada na mnogim poljima medicine. Osim toga, i dijagnostika je često ekstremno neefikasna. Na primer, na svakih 1,000 žena koje su pregledane na mamogramu, 4 umru od raka na dojci, a od nepregledanih žena umre 5 od 1,000. Slično važi za rak prostate, gde je pregled ujedno i dosta mučan. Lekar koji je prvi pronašao ćelije koje mogu da ukažu na rak prostate, kaže da je i danas pravilna dijagnoza više nalik bacanju novčića nego nauci.Koliki je napredak medicine, pokazuje i mortalitet dece do 5 godina, koji je pao sa 218 na 1,000 rođenih u 1950. godini, na 38 smrti na 1,000 danas. Čudesno je napredovalo i produženje životne dobi, ali iako smo produžili život, nismo uspeli da produžimo kvalitetan život. Na svakih 12 meseci produženog života, samo 2 meseca su zdrava.SAD, uprkos masovnim ulaganjima u medicinu (autor kaže da bi više mogli da urade jedino da svima nama obuku bele mantile), i dalje mnogo zaostaje na većini polja za drugim zemljama razvijenog sveta, pa čak i mnogo siromašnijim. Ne radi se o klasnim razlikama, i bogati žive lošije i kraće, i češće oboljevaju. ""A randomly selected American aged forty-five to fifty-four is more than twice as likely to die, from any cause, as someone from the same age-group in Sweden. "". Najveći deo toga pripisuje se ishrani, ali ima i drugih faktora. ""We are living in bodies of hunter-gatherers, but living a lifestyle of coach-potato."""
75,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72907701-dax,Rating 4 out of 5,"Bryson has become Old Mr. Reliable. You know what you can expect from him: solid writing, thorough research and a lot of humor. In this case, his humor is very welcome since quite a few of the topics are... kind of scary. More than 8,000 ways to die from internal complications, antibiotics crisis, cancer..and hundreds of other diseases and malfunctions. This is not a book for a hypochondriac, but it has a ton of interesting facts. I particularly enjoyed hearing about doctors and scientists who played key roles in discovering diseases or treatments for illnesses. A lot of trial and error, a lot of poor judgement calls. A much more entertaining read than you might expect. Excellent."
76,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9846570-leah,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book is everythiiiinnnngggggg 5/5 stars.Bill Bryson goes over mostly everything about the body, everything that has significance at least. He explains the main things about each component of the body with enough detail to pretty much skim the surface on everything. He doesn't dive into the full scientific aspects but makes it readable and understandable to the masses that have a bit of scientific knowledge. The book is not for people who know nothing about the body because reading this book would be overload, but it's not for people who know a lot of knowledge about the body because they would probably know most of this book. But even people who know mostly about the body would appreciate the historic facts and backstories Bryson provides.The book goes over bodily things, what, how, why, where, and then goes into some interesting history of how we got to the what, how, why, where.A great book, definitely a re-read, tons of knowledge here. It's very textbook and it took me a long time to finish the book.I would have to re-read it for full notes but here's some that I jotted down:- we actually really don't know a lot about science, like we don't have cure's for many many conditions- spanish flu was the worst epidemic ever- Man cancer is really bad =/ treatments use to be so barbaric lol cutting off a boob with a knife- Sleep apnea, narcolepsy, insomnia, Y chromosome shrinking, a fetus having millions of eggs, reproduction- There can be so many issues with lungs. There is no cure for asthma and we don't know why or how we get it lol same with hiccups- Our immune system is super smart and can be super dumb lol""- Bipedalism (walking on two legs/feet) is actually a beautiful thing that humans have just recently developed in relation to the test of time. Even when apes walk they have to waddle because there legs, spine, even their neck/head isn't meant to stand upright.- Pancreas, spleen, gall bladder- Man... lobotomy's were really a crazy thing back then eh... sticking an ice pick past your eyeball and wiggling it around your brain gahhhhh- We have about 30 trillion human cells, and 30-50 trill bacteria cells so we’re just a big fat watery bacteria 85% of our cells are red blood cells which actually aren’t true cells at all because they don’t have the typical cell machinery like nuclei and mitochondria. Red bloods cells are only containers for hemoglobin. We'v about 20k human genes in us but 20m bacteria genes so really we are 99% bacterial and 1% you"
77,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,Rating 1 out of 5,"One of the earliest books I ever read was by Bryson, and I remember it fondly. So it was a little disappointing to read this book and realize how superficial of an author he is. He really says a lot of stupid stuff because, apparently, he doesn't know any better:* Claims red blood cells ""aren't true cells at all"" because they lack nuclei & mitochondria. Tell that to a prokaryote!* Claims some lady scratched through her own skull, which is a gross misrepresentation (source). Reading the original case study one learns the bone was weakened and eroded by chronic infection. The infection was caused by scratching and HIV. It doesn't say, nor is it reasonable to assume that scratching directly caused bone damage.* He defines organic chemicals as chemicals ""from living things"" which is wrong. They're defined as chemicals that contain carbon. Open any Organic Chemistry textbook!* He gives a poor description of complex carbohydrates, and incorrectly claims they have the ""same effect on blood glucose"" as the equivalent amount of sugar. Tell that to a diabetic! Glycemic index measures the effect on blood glucose and the timing of release matters. Glycemic index of complex carbohydrates is higher than their equivalent in simple sugars because it takes time for the body to break the bonds between sugar groups. This slows down release and ""flattens the curve"".* He provides a scientifically illiterate review of Ancel Keys and the Mediterranean diet.This chapter in particular would not receive a passing grade in High School AP biology. It's full of alternative medicine dog whistles. It could have been written by someone reading the a few news headlines and not doing any further research into the topic.* He repeats the snake oil salesman's lie that ""doctors can go through medical school without being taught nutrition"". Practitioners in alternative medicine and peddlers of dietary supplements have a financial interest in causing distrust in the medical profession. This is why they push the false narrative that doctors don't study nutrition. In reality, doctors get plenty of education in nutrition science during study in premed, organic chemistry, and differential diagnostics. The robust medical and academic consensus is that doctors are well trained to advise patients on dietary matters, and diagnose diseases influenced by diet.* Nowhere in an entire chapter on nutrition is there so much as mention of the word ""macromolecule""! Leaving out such an important vocabulary word is simply unacceptable.* He repeats the snake oil salesman's other lie that chemotherapy is ""like mustard gas"" which takes the cake for being both anti-medicine and profoundly ignorant of basic biochemistry.Don't tell me these are necessary simplifications to reach a larger audience.They're outrageous mistakes that any scientifically literate editor should have caught."
78,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18643650-mark-porton,Rating 3 out of 5,"I was really looking forward to The Body - A Guide for Occupants - by Bill Bryson, I mean, really looking forward to it.Bryson takes us through the human body in a way that makes sense, each chapter is dedicated to a certain organ or system. He starts with the outside, the skin, and then systematically proceeds through chapters titled The Brain, The Heart and Blood, The Immune System, The Guts, Sleep and so on. This goes on for 23 chapters.I need to be careful not to be unfair here as I suppose your enjoyment of this lengthy book probably depends on what you expect from it. If you want to learn about most of the major elements of the body, particularly coming in as a freshman, this is the book for you. You will find Bryson covers each topic more than adequately and doesn't drill down too much to become academic. He touches each subject lightly and sufficiently. There is a lot to learn, and the historical insights are particularly fascinating. The latter is what Bryson usually does particularly well.My expectation here - rightly or wrongly - was to have a right, rollicking, gut busting laugh. I remember reading A Short History of Nearly Everything and there were many times in that book I just couldn't breathe, I found it that funny. Particularly the anecdotes about mad, desperate, profoundly intelligent scientists and audacious pioneers getting themselves into ludicrous situations. This is what I wanted here, chapter after chapter I was waiting for that massive belly laugh and it just didn't come. It's not only the story one normally finds funny, it's Bryson's impressive command of the English language that usually gets me. In many ways, there is nothing funnier than the written word. But for me, with this book, not this time. So, it is a good book and if you want a good all round education in pretty much everything to do with the human body with some interesting historical perspectives thrown in, you'll like this book a lot. If you are after fits of laughter, like I was, you may not get them - he's written funnier stuff.I can only give this one 3 stars, which is probably unfair as my expectations were so high.3 Stars"

I have a degree in Applied Science and have studied biology, physiology, chemistry, etc., but this is the book that brought it all home!I have read all books authored by Bill Bryson because I love his humor -- however, this is not his normal humorous writing.

Even biology and human anatomy.Being a wonderful trave guide, this time Bryson takes us through a highly delightful tour of the human body. The book is packed with a lot of interesting information, but it’s not overwhelming or too much for a pleasure reader. It is full of astonishing facts - for instance did you know that it takes more time for food to go down in the digestive system of a woman’s body than a man’s? Or that you shed half a kilo of skin everyday? Or even a crazier one is that you get cancer everyday! Or you would do if your natural defences weren’t such troopers!The biggest takeaway I had from this book was that although mankind has had amazing accomplishments in medicine and science, we’re still a very long way from knowing how and why a lot of things work. Also, it is very possible to live a good life, we just have to take care of the body we occupy. Highly recommended!"

Αλλά σε αυτή την περίπτωση, έχει προλάβει να σας πανικοβάλλει το ίντερνετ που ψάχνετε κάθε (συνήθως φανταστικό) σύμπτωμά σας για να ανακαλύψετε ότι έχετε πολυκυστικές ωοθήκες (αν και άντρες) ή επιδιδυμίτιδα (αν και γυναίκες).Και μην ξεχνάτε, όπως λέει και στο βιβλίο:The definition of a “well” person?Someone who hasn’t been examined yet!Πέρα από όλα αυτά, αν σκεφτεί κανείς πόσα πράγματα μπορούν να πάνε στραβά από τη στιγμή της σύλληψης και μετά, πόσοι ιοί και βακτήρια μας πολιορκούν, πόσα κύτταρά μας μπορούν να ""τρελαθούν"", πόσοι μολυσματικοί παράγοντες μας περιμένουν ""τρίβοντας τα χέρια"", μάλλον το σώμα των περισσότερων τα καταφέρνει εξαιρετικά (έστω και με σχετική υποβοήθηση από την ιατρική και τη φαρμακευτική επιστήμη κάποιες φορές), για περίπου 75-80 χρόνια κατά μέσο όρο, κάτι όχι ασήμαντο αν το καλοσκεφτείς!"

It’s likely to be more interesting to someone who has little medical knowledge, as much of the material he covered I already knew. I did enjoy some of the historical context he provided. I was disconcerted by some of his errors, though, and it made me wonder what mistakes he might have made that I didn’t know enough to catch. For example, he stated that all senses except smell are routed through the hypothalamus. They actually go through the thalamus. That might seem like a minor error, but it’s pretty basic neuroscience, and even my Intro Psych students know it. It was also a little annoying to listen to him read the book even though I generally enjoy him as a narrator. He mispronounced a number of medical/scientific terms (systole, diastole, encephalitis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, etc), which again seems nitpicky, but it took away from the experience for me. I did learn a few interesting things, though. For example, apparently left-handed kids who are forced to write with their right hands are at increased risk of stuttering, which I found fascinating.I don’t want to dog on this book too much. I think Bill Bryson is fantastic, generally. But I would recommend A Walk in the Woods, A Short History of Nearly Everything, and The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid far, far above this one."
89,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15962370-sarah,Rating 4 out of 5,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading, and learned a lot from, Bryson's latest release, which meanders chapter-by-chapter through advances in medical knowledge around various human body systems and processes. However, I'm not sure that it's quite at the same level for bringing the layperson up to speed as his previous title A Short History of Nearly Everything.I was particularly struck by the number of medical and scientific pioneers who have never been widely recognised for their accomplishments, or at least not until long after their own demise. According to Bryson, there are many largely undeserved Nobel prizes out there!I should also mention that I occasionally found the copy editing rather puzzling - in several instances paragraphs ran on into completely different topics, where I feel a paragraph break would have been warranted. There was also a lot of inexplicable redirection in topics, only for the text to return to the original subject several paragraphs later. I felt the book as a whole would have been more effective, and certainly its content easier for the reader to digest, had it been edited more thoughtfully."

It explores disease and really cool capabilities and phenomena, in addition to just your regular functions. It’s not exactly bryson-humorous, but it does have a bit lighter tone for a science book. With bryson’s established quality/brand, this should be an easy handsell."

Em janeiro quando lhe meti as mãos em cima e comecei a ler fiquei naturalmente agarrado, mas o trabalho foi tirando tempo para o completar. E eis que, de um momento para o outro, estamos fechados em casa, e tempo é coisa que não falta. Pois nada melhor que repôr os níveis de leitura que andavam em mínimos históricos. Adorei como é habitual ler e aprender com Bryson. Não desilude os fãs do género!"
94,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27024428,No Rating,"Бил Брайсън - ""Тялото. Наръчник за употреба"", изд. ""Сиела"" 2020, прев. Анна Карабинска-ГаневаТоку-що приключих едно невероятно пътешествие. А именно - дългото, загадъчно, удивително - и понякога стряскащо - ""пътуване"" из човешкото тяло.""Тялото. Наръчник за употреба"" в известна степен е точно това, което изглежда. Книга, в която се говори за строежа, функциите, проблемите и болестите на човешкото тяло. С /почти/ всички познати и не дотам познати термини и сложни думи, коитно някои от нас са чували, но повечето вероятно не са. И, както вероятно би казал самият автор, това понякога може да звучи объркващо, а в много случаи - откровено неразбирае��о.Не и когато за тези неща пише автор като Бил Брайсън. Неслучайно сравних четненето на тази книга с пътуване. Не само защото Брайсън действително ни превежда из всички органи и системи на човешкото тяло. А и защото при всяко пътуване, особено из /относително/ непозната територия е много важно да имаме добър водач. А Брайсън определено е такъв. Без излишно ""залитане"" към сложни и ""твърде умни"" думи, на ясен и разбираем език той ни запознава с всяка една част и важен орган от тялото. Прави го по онзи начин, който води до неусетно и лесно запомняне. Понякога - дори с невероятното си чувство за хумор./Деликатно и премерено, без да звучи непочтително./Направи ми впечатление огромната библиография, цитирана в края на книгата, както и фактът, че освен това по време на проучванията си Брайсън се консултира и с голям брой медици и други специалисти в съответните области. Можи би, четейки книгата, човек би се запитал: ""Откъде този не-специалист знае всички тези неща?"" или дори: ""Не е ли твърде самоуверено човек, който не е свързан професионално с медицината, да пише подобна книга?"" Признавам, че в някакъв момент аз се питах същото. Съмненията ми бяха разсеяни именно от библиографията и цитиланите ксонсултации със специалисти.Разбира се, всеки от нас има поне основни познания за нещата, споменати или подробно опидсани в книгата. Но лично аз научих купища интересни подробности, които може и да не ми потрябват никога - но потвърждават за пореден път това, което понякога осъзнаваме - че нашето тяло е едно истинско чудо. Една все още не съвсем разрешена загадка. Че понякога /за съжаление твърде често/ сме безкрайно небрежни към него. И че е истинско чудо как то се бори за нас и успява да ни защити /или поне предпази донякъде/ от собствената ни неразумност.Една от най-интересните глави ми беше тази, посветена на съня. Мислила съм си често нещата, които прочетох в нея. Задавала съм си същите въпроси. И също както и тук, още търся отговорите. Много интересна ми беше и главата ""Нерви и болка"". Тя отговори на доста от ""чуденките"" ми, донякъде дори по въпроса за главоболието - въпрос, който ме занимава по лични причини, откакто се помня.В ""Тялото. Наръчник за употреба"" Брайсън е ссъщо толкова великолепен, колкото и в другите си книги, може би дори повече, защото темата е много по-сериозна. И най-хубавото - тя не е ""книга за специалисти"". Смятам, че би могла да бъде разбрана достатъчно добре от всеки, който не е ""проспал"" часовете по биология в училище.Чаках тази книга с голямо нетърпение, и сега определено мога да кажа, че е имало защо. Ако ви се чете информативна, достъпно и интелигентно написана книга по теми, които засягат всеки един от нас - препоръчвам я с две ръце. Заслужава си."
95,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3214163-brandon,Rating 4 out of 5,"Bill Bryson’s books are like the literary equivalent of the British panel show Qi. Like an episode of the long-running series, his books are filled with tidbits of trivia presented in a quirky and humorous way. While Bryson is often quite ambitious in tackling the subjects that interest him (attempting to explain the universe in 2003’s A Short History of Nearly Everything), no single book should be considered the definitive account on any topic.As indicated above, the disclaimer also applies to The Body. Bryson breaks down the human body and attempts to answer questions about what makes us.. us. The author tackles everything from the top of your head to the tips of your toes and everything in between. Why do we itch? Why are we filled with millions of microbes at any given time? Why are some viruses deadly and others pass through without even a sign they were there? Why on a long enough timeline, do we all eventually get cancer? These are just a few of the questions Bryson tackles in his new book.There were many moments where I audibly gasped reading this book and struggled with whether I should tell my hypochondriac partner what I read. I did read her one bit about a woman who scratched through her skull and into her brain during sleep and judging by Alaina’s scream, I hesitated to read any more unsettling parts aloud.It’s amazing the level of sophistication we have only now when it comes to surgery. Obviously, things evolve, but it is horrific to hear about the irresponsible way we even practiced lobotomies and brain surgery in the mid 1900s. No sterilization, just cram an icepick into your eye sockets and wiggle it around until you sever key components of the human brain. There’s no way we could have gotten to where we are now without having to experiment over the years, but I could think of better things to do than trying to transfuse our blood stream with beer and milk.One of the most interesting parts of the book deals with how the brain interprets the information sent by our eyes. Bryson writes that it takes one fifth of a second for what we see to be interpreted by the brain. So we are never truly seeing the present. Wild, eh? So, our brain makes up the difference by forecasting what the world will look like a fifth of a second from now. So, as Bryson says, “we are all living in a world that does not exist yet.”One thing I will say – I’m no expert in science let alone how the human body works. Maybe I have somewhat of an idea of how mine struggles to get through the day, but I couldn’t tell you if Bryson made any big errors or mistakes in this book. Luckily, there are reviews like this one who can speak more authoritatively on the matter. While the reviewer did point out a few errors, the majority of the book seems to be sound.I really enjoyed this read and definitely recommend it.. I feel like I learned a lot, or at least things that I can bring up randomly in conversations. For example, to build Benedict Cumberbatch from scratch would cost you $151,578.46. So, there’s that."

Pero más placentero aún es leer sobre la ciencia de tu propio cuerpo. Esto es lo que hace este libro maravilloso. Desbaratarte por dentro y por fuera, no dejar ninguna esquina de tu fantástico (y ""sucio"") cuerpo sobre la cual hablar.El libro esta increíblemente bien escrito. Tiene un lenguaje llano casi completamente exento de tecnicismos médicos y biológicos, con una dosis precisa de anécdotas, historia y datos curiosos (¡cientos de datos curiosos!). Leí el libro en inglés porque creo no esta todavía traducido (y no acostumbro hacerlo porque no soporto no saber el significado de todas las palabras de un libro o tener que estar buscando como si fuera un escolar), pero aún así, y a diferencia de muchos libros, lo encontré agradable y fácil de leer.El texto no tiene una estructura definida, cada capítulo se ocupa de un ""aparte"" del cuerpo humano, el sistema inmune (""el órgano más increíble""), los pulmones y la respiración, el departamento de química (hormonas y otras sustancias producidas por las múltiples glándulas del cuerpo), la comida (que no es una parte, pero sí un importante ""capítulo"" del funcionamiento de esta máquina maravillosa), los nervios y el dolor, etc. Esta falta de una ""estructura"", que sería mas propia de un libro académico, hace aún más agradable la lectura en tanto confirma lo que es el libro: un texto fácil y agradable de leer para todos.Solo le veo un defecto: después de leerlo, como sucede después de ir al médico, terminas demasiado consciente de todo lo que pasa. Ahora siento más frío que antes y se lo achaco al hecho de que ya pase de los 45 y he empezado un lento pero inevitable ""decaimiento físico"" que incluye perder no solo masa muscular sino la capa de grasa subcutánea que mantiene calienticos a los más ""pipiolos""; ya no puedo comer sin pensar en las perniciosas grasas trans o en la comida súper procesada con la que nos envenenamos lentamente; no puedo estar sentado más de una hora sin pensar que las enfermedades más graves de la modernidad no son las enfermedades cardíacas o el Alzheimer, sino el estilo de vida y una alimentación poco saludable. En fin: ¡ahora todo me parece indicio de que algo anda mal en mi cuerpo! Pero eso me pasa a mí que soy un poco neurótico.Lean libro y comprueben por ustedes mismos."
97,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5884823-luis,Rating 4 out of 5,"Nuestras células y órganos poseen un funcionamiento complejo y a la vez elogiable. A medida que uno comprende más acerca de la fisiología, más dudas le surgen acerca de cómo es posible de que falle tan poco a menudo en nuestra vida diaria. Bill Bryson escribe a lo largo de más de veinte capítulos sobre los distintos sistemas del cuerpo, como el sistema digestivo o el inmunitario, y también se mete a comentar aspectos sobre nuestro sueño, la muerte o el cáncer.Es libro es innegablemente atractivo y se devora solo. Está salpicado de curiosidades sobre nuestros órganos, también de anécdotas de pacientes y médicos pioneros en el tratamiento de las enfermedades, a la vez que ofrece varios datos y estudios para soportar la argumentación. El autor mantiene un tono muy ameno - varias veces gracioso - y no se suele meter en complejidades, a la vez que parte de la humildad de lo que descubre y admira a las personas a las que entrevista durante el libro. El ansia por saber con qué te va a sorprender Bryson en la siguiente página mantiene la atención, ya que ha compuesto un volumen que es a la vez una historia de la medicina, una revisión de parámetros de salud de las últimas décadas y un inicio de tratado de fisiología. Todo bastante modesto, claro.Como aspectos para no darle la máxima puntuación, destacaría el exceso de utilizar personajes con nombres propios. No dudo de la importancia capital de todos los médicos, pacientes e investigadores a los que se hace referencia, pero basar tanto el texto en estos protagonistas aleja el verdadero objeto de estudio del libro, que no es sino nuestra anatomía y su funcionamiento. Puede que el tono dé algunos rodeos atípicos, pero es un sello del escritor. Es una obra divulgativa de la que es seguro que se pueden subrayar decenas de datos interesantes, no profundiza pero tampoco lo pretende."

It is quintessential Bill Bryson, at his best, full of humor, history, and LOADS of information about the body, all kinds of things you often wondered about (like how long food stays in your stomach or your intestines) or never thought about at all, like ow many times a day you blink (14,000). The research he clearly did for the book is extremely impressive, and I'll bet it was fun.It is taking me a while to read the book, not because I do not like it but because I am enjoying it so much. I limit myself to one or two chapters daily; there is so much content that it can be overwhelming in large doses. Let me give you one caution: it might be best to read this book when you are alone, because otherwise you are going to annoy your family members, whom you will interrupt VERY frequently because you MUST share the latest fascinating and/or funny tidbit with them. Of course, you could avoid the problem by listening to the book together; that would provoke some very interesting conversation!"
99,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42096394-jovi-ene,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ca de obicei, Bill Bryson face o treabă excelentă și sunt slabe șansele să nu fi entuziasmat de felul în care el își construiește cărțile, dacă le-ai alege, pentru că îmbină într-o manieră foarte abilă prezentarea subiectelor pe înțelesul tuturor celor care îl citesc cu erudiția și documentarea științifică.Ceea ce face și în „Corpul”, o prezentare exhaustivă și plină de referințe despre acest complex și complicat mecanism care este corpul nostru. Și o face în capitole distincte, luând la rând fiecare organ, parte sau sistem al corpului, disecându-l pentru a-l face mai ușor de înțeles și de cei care nu sunt specialiști. Și nu se oprește numai asupra acestora, ci discută și despre echilibru, boli, durere, medicină sau hrană, ca să nu mai vorbim despre... sfârșit. Cu erudiție, cum spuneam, și cu umor, așa cum ne-a obișnuit Bill Bryson. Excelent, as usual! "
100,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2641352-marie-uk,Rating 2 out of 5,"I think whether or not you enjoy this book depends on your current level of knowledge about the subject matter. For me there was nothing new in the is book and to some extent an over emphasis on figures such as the length of this, that and the other. There were also blatantly wrong statements. Bryson describes a cancer hospital in the Netherlands, its patients (all ventilated according to the author) scooting around on toy cars or bicycles. I feel he must be referring to naso-gastric tubes rather than ones to help you breathe. Such a mistake is unforgivable not only on the part of the author but of the editors. Readers should be able to trust the information they are given in non-fiction"
101,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20408288-will-m,Rating 5 out of 5,"I'm currently a third year medical student and I honestly wasn't expecting this book to be brief yet so informative. It talked about the body, from up to down, inside and out. The author only briefly discusses parts of the body and tends to explain medical jargons in a way that an average person could understand. His discussions mostly begin with a historical background of the disease or operation, and then he correlates it with the disease and organ involved. Everything he talked about here (as far as I can remember) is medically correct and accurate. Highly recommended even to non-medical field related people who are just interested to know everything, but not the entirety, of the human body."

Easy to read, entertaining, all the while being scientific make this a great informative book."

He manages to find fresh material and present it so clearly that I always feel as if I've been taught by a master. I also appreciate that he reads his own books in his own style. "

105,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4582860-tanabrus,Rating 3 out of 5,"Sempre piacevole leggere un libro di Bryson, anche se in questo caso lo spunto per regalarci aneddoti e dati poco conosciuti (e cioè il corpo umano, e quanto poco generalmente se ne sappia) mancava di un vero e proprio filo conduttore, facendo sì che ogni capitoli fosse a sé stante.Alla fine il libro è un elenco di nozioni e di storie relative a svariate parti del corpo, una dopo l'altra.Interessante e d'intrattenimento (questo autore è una fonte apparentemente inesauribile di aneddoti assurdi e divertenti), ma mi ha preso meno di altri suoi libri.Possibile sia stato anche a causa di un periodo in cui ho avuto poco tempo da dedicargli, ma di solito se un libro mi cattura il tempo per leggere salta fuori. Qui invece una lettura altrimenti rapida è durata quasi due settimane, qualcosa non è scattato.Comunque, mi ripeto, interessanti le nozioni e divertenti gli aneddoti.Inoltre, quanti dottori e primari e scienziati conosce Bill???E poi, la parte sul nostro essere pressoché completamente impreparati di fronte alla possibilità dell'arrivo di una pandemia, il fatto che la stessa influenza sia pericolosissima e che ogni anno venga scelto quasi per caso il ceppo per cui creare il vaccino stagionale, i raffronti con le epidemie del passato... questa parte mi ha fatto rabbrividire. Specialmente perché il libro è uscito a fine 2019, quando cominciava a girare il Covid, ancora di nascosto...Lascia a bocca aperta quanto poco si sappia del corpo e del suo funzionamento, non solo noi ""utilizzatori"" di un corpo ma pure gli esperti, medici e scienziati. O quante scoperte siano state frutto totalmente del caso, o di errori. O gli orrori medici del passato.Francamente non capisco perché non mi sia piaciuto di più questo libro..."
106,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,Rating 3 out of 5,"Bill Bryson takes the reader on a tour of the human body. It is well-organized by type of function. It is a book of popular science, geared toward the non-scientist. It is a compilation of secondary sources, anecdotes, and historical episodes. Bryson dispels a few myths and imparts useful facts about health. This author is known for his humor, but this book is not particularly humorous. In fact, a strong stomach will be needed for a few segments. There is a good amount of repetition that probably should have been edited out. I think your reaction to it will depend on how much of this material you have already heard (or read). I read science books regularly, so I was already familiar with most of this information. It is reasonably entertaining but if you are looking for scientific analysis, there are other books I would recommend ahead of this one. "

Quirky stories aligned to historical/modern facts about the subject at hand. The subject at hand is you. Well, your body. All of it. From top to toe and all bits in-between. From the time you were conceived to the time you die.What a great journey it is. I was boring the family by stopping them watching Saturday evening TV by telling them facts about their body that they didn’t really want to hear that I found fascinating. Do you know that 59 elements are needed to construct a human being. Carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus account for 99.1%. Did you know that the formal name for skin is the cutaneous system. The inner layer is called the dermis. The outer layer is called the epidermis. Skin and hair are made largely of the same stuff – keratin. There are so many more examples of this. You can see why they wanted to lock me away in the kitchen to read and stop bothering them.The thing is with Bryson is that he knows how to weave a really complicated subject into a text that is readable, entertaining and educating. Admittedly a lot of the facts and stats he throws at you are mind-boggling. I took about 5 pages of A4 notes. It could have been a lot more but I would have ended up just copying the book.The research is, of course, extensive. He spoke to so many people and must have read a load of medical journals and books. Some of the stories on these early, mainly Victorian, medical pioneers who would experiment on themselves to see if certain techniques, drugs and even surgery would work sometimes with great effect but a lot of the time failing resulting in terrible injuries including death.What do you think the most devastating disease in history is? It infected nearly everyone that was exposed to it. It killed 30% of its victims. 500 million died.In 1872 Charles Darwin published a book on expressions and it showed that all people, whatever their race, shared a common heritage. Fear, anger, surprise, pleasure, disgust and sorrow are universal. The most universal of them all is the smile. Keep Smiling everyone."
109,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1654645-deb-readerbuzz-nance,Rating 5 out of 5,"Bill Bryson teaches you everything you didn’t know you wanted to know about the human body in this book. Bryson takes on the brain and skin and hair and the skeleton and the immune system and lungs and food and guts and sleep and birth and nerves and pain and disease and cancer and death. He tells the stories of the scientists behind the discoveries about the body. Everything is backed with science and footnotes, and that’s part of the delight in this book, but the other part are the anecdotes about the body and the people studying the body, and that’s a true joy.This is the kind of book that (probably) drives everyone else in your family crazy; you read a little and you can’t help yourself from reading parts of it aloud, and then you laugh together and walk away, and you read some more, and then you share some more, and on and on to the end. A new favorite nonfiction read."

Now I’ll try not to drop everything I’ve learned here into conversation as frequently as possible, but did you know that oysters can get herpes? Or that 4% of (lucky-ass) people say they’ve never gotten a headache? Or that men DON’T think about sex every seven seconds? (Why/how did we ever think they did in the first place?)

112,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Body was written in a breezy tone, but is surprisingly substantive in its brief tour of the human body, description of modern knowledge of physiology and medicine, and its historical and often chatty vignettes of science and discovery. ""Brief"" is a bit of a misnomer, as The Body is about 550 pages long, but it could have easily been twice as long (and dense) in someone else's hands.I enjoyed Bill Bryson's trivia. Did you know that each of us contains about 30 trillion human cells and between 30-50 trillion bacterial cells? That between one and five of our cells turns cancerous every day – and that our immune system captures and kills (most of) them? Or that: Your lungs, smoothed out, would cover a tennis court, and the airways within them would stretch nearly from coast to coast. The length of all your blood vessels would take you two and a half times around Earth. The most remarkable part of all is your DNA (or deoxyribonucleic acid). You have a meter of it packed into every cell, and so many cells that if you formed all the DNA in your body into a single strand, it would stretch ten billion miles, to beyond Pluto. (p. 15)I enjoyed The Body, but Bryson drove me nuts as he often shared a tidbit, then moved on without following up his point. Sometimes, as when he said that teens were four times as likely to be in a car accident when they were with other teens, I knew why. (Distractedness and poorer executive functioning relative to adults.) But why tell us that the American Heart Association pushed down the criterion for hypertension from 140/90 to 130/90 if you're not going to tell us why?Bryson included many photos of scientists he discussed. I enjoyed them, but I would have appreciated and preferred line drawings of the structures described. Doing so would have made the book much more useful and user-friendly."
113,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9329323-pallavi,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 starsThis was a horrendously informative read. The author tackles the human body from top to bottom, of course the important parts or the fascinating ones. He also talks about the medical/medicine history. Every chapter had something interesting to tell, statistics on how it was before and now or how it differs from country to country or region. The baffling power of our body and mind. The myths or legends which are still haunting our society. The most cringe worthy parts were two in this book,1)The tests were done on humans with new medicines along with surgeries (thank the lord, i am not a medical person. I m a coward). 2)How so many medicines we are taking now, are still not the exact solution for the ailments.  Well researched, each chapter tells us not about a body part but also the medical history, politics involved, experiments done etc which was very interesting. Even after these many years of research oh human body and as human residing inside a body, we almost know nothing much concrete about it. Body keeps amazing us.Happy Reading!"

116,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,Rating 5 out of 5,"Bill Bryson is somebody else who agrees that we overtest, overoperate and prescribe too many medications, especially here in America, but, with variations by country, throughout the modern west. Nothing earthshaking in this book for me, but just a good Bryson science popularizing romp.That said, he did have one or two things that ""made me think.""One was about the idea that, due to nerve transmission speed, our eyes-to-brains system ""sees"" things with 1/5 second delay behind reality, but that the brain does its best job of confabulating what live time reality should be. Well, with recent reports on the German background of the famous, or infamous, Libet experiment, I got to wondering if maybe, even though Libet got some things wrong, BUT other things right (biggest wrong — whatever this delay is, it doesn't disprove free will in some version and it surely doesn't prove determinism), maybe there's something kind of related here.The other thing? I never knew before — even tho it has a subhead within Wiki — that Mona Lisa has no eyebrows. And is also light on eyelashes. I know many people have commented on its ""eyes follow you around the room"" effect, while also noting this isn't the only painting that does that. But — does the no eyebrows/light eyelashes help the effect?Bryson is also good on the basics of pointing out how modern medicine and biology refute the idea of ""race."" Skin color is literally one mm deep. Beyond the commonly known blood type groups, there are many others — which could be used to reclassify what a ""race"" is, if one did want to go down that road.Finally, Bryson ends with ""the end."" It's the human body. We die. Why? Without going Kurzweil, how much can we extend the lifespan? First, even as they remain in the news? Telomeres have only a small effect on the aging process. So, ignore any supplements or other claims to boost your telomeres. Second, the causes of aging are many. Third, on causes of death? Alzheimer's continues to rise, but dozens of other dementias exist. Cancer has many, many causes, and in part because of that, no cure is around the corner.In the background, with Bryson joviality, lurks a message of acceptance."

Книгата почва като любовно обяснение към човешкото тяло докато преминаваш през различните системи, органи и скелета. Определено помага да погледнеш към тялото си от различна гледна точка и с малко повече любов към всичките не най-приятни неща, които тялото прави понякога и да си най-вече по-добронамерен към тялото си, което определено може да мине за много изтезаван роб, визирайки на какво го подлагаме ежедневно. След любовното обяснение книгата прави U-turn и ти сервира информация, която върви ръка за ръка с осъзнаването, че медицината и фармацията не са точно това, което всички мислим, че са, и това е доста напрягаща информация да поемеш. Като всяко друго нещо в този живот - трябва да направиш проучване за себе си и да вземеш решение на база какви са твоите цели и желания за живота ти. Докторите са хора като нас и не са всесилни. Ти наемаш техните знания и заедно вземете решение, не докторът поема бремето за твоя живот, той си е твоя отговорност. Когато разберем това, може би и медицината ще бъде медицина, а не здравна индустрия, чиято единствената цел е добра печалба.Накрая книгата стига до най-мрачните и депресиращи части, където колкото и да си подготвен, някои неща просто ти идват тежички за преглъщане. Книгата трябва да се чете с отворено съзнание и ако не си готов да приемеш, че как ще умреш е въпрос на времето в което живееш, на гени и на супа от случайни обстоятелства, не я чети!!Много хора предпочитат да не знаят и да вярват, че докторите имат всички отговори и че медицината може да предложи някое вълшебно лекарство, което да излекува каквото ти има. Няма лошо, всички правим това, което помага най-много на мозъкът ни да оцелее. Другата група, която би харесала тази книга, са тези които предпочитат да знаят, за да избегнат ненужен прием на лекарства или манипулации, и дори ако са нужни - да изберат до колкото могат с ясно съзнание, че те са взели решението, не някой друг.Определено прекрасна книга. Кара те да мислиш, да разсъждаваш, да се чудиш, да поемеш отговорност, което е всичко, че и повече, от което може да очакваш от една добра книга. :)"
118,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2475612-kyle-muntz,Rating 5 out of 5,"I'm becoming increasingly convinced Bill Bryson is one of the great prose stylists of the English language. That sounds bizarre, I know, but look at this: ""The skin consists of an inner layer called the dermis and an outer epidermis. The outermost surface of the epidermis, called the stratum corneum, is made up entirely of dead cells. It is an arresting thought that all that makes you lovely is deceased. Where body meets air, we are all cadavars. These outer skin cells are replaced every month. We shed skin copiously, almost carelessly; some twenty five thousand flakes a minute, over a million pieces every hour. Run a finger along a dusty shelf, and you are in large part clearing a path through fragments of your former self. Silently and remorselessly we turn to dust.""This goes on for 500 pages without a single boring paragraph. Essentially, he uses every tool a writer has to supercharge information--and he's incredibly good at it. The book is often quite funny, but occasionally quite profound or even shocking. I've devoured each of his science-themed books in a few days, and it seems I won't be able to resist at least trying out the ones on language."
119,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75748905-elizabeth,Rating 4 out of 5,"A great read if you enjoy wacky science trivia that starts at the skin and burrows all the way down to your heart, bones, and everything else packed inside us. We are definitely more than a bag of bones, and Bryson makes that abundantly clear. He does a comprehensive job of discussing each part of the human body, pointing out what we do and don’t know regarding physiology and medicine alongside the historical quirks of discovery. There are some nice pop culture references and silly humor scattered throughout to keep the info easy to digest. We never get too bogged down in the details, which is perhaps a curse if you want to know just a little bit more about something Bryson mentions. But hey, Google can’t hurt you there.This book will not be for those looking for detail. In fact, Bryson name-drops a few fantastic authors and experts in their fields, Siddhartha Murkerjee, Atul Gawande, Martin Blaser, and Jerome Groopman, to name a few. Their books a definitely worth checking out. Overall, The Body is definitely worth a read or two, so please go on ahead and dip your toes into it!"

I got hooked on his writings with ""A Walk in the Woods"" where he attempts the Appalachian trail with a high school friend after living abroad for many years and have found his travel books about Britain, the U.S. and Australia to be very entertaining. And I guess that is why if one expects a similar level of mirth in his educational material one is likely to be disappointed. However, if some education is what you are seeking, this book will serve you well."

Also moderately terrifying is how often Bryson and the many doctors and scientists he consulted for this book admit that this organ/procedure/portion of the brain does X...but we don't know how, or why. Honestly, the book could be alternately titled ""The Body: How the F*** Does It Work?"""

His usual attention to detail, little known events, plenty of facts, quirky characters and his quota of Dad jokes. It's an impressive coverage of the human body, what makes us tick and what doesn't.

Quizá sea que leo demasiados libros de ciencia, jajaja, entonces la competencia es ardua, pero para gente que haya explorado menos, es un buen punto de inicio, porque es detallado y meticuloso sin ser latero. De hecho, en ocasiones hasta me hizo reír, con carcadas y todo. Mucho humor británico el señor, aunque sea originario de los Estados Unidos se nota que ha pasado más de la mitad de su vida allí.Cuatro estrellas porque igual es súper bueno. Hay partes en que la información que dio estaba un tanto desactualizada, pero aún así creo que vale la pena leerlo, en especial si se ha indagado poco en lo absolutamente maravillosa que es la naturaleza.Algunas citas que destaqué :D 1. Awww, y sí.Con frecuencia se compara al cuerpo con una máquina, pero en realidad es mucho más que eso: trabaja las veinticuatro horas del día durante décadas sin necesidad (en su mayor parte) de un mantenimiento regular o la instalación de piezas de repuesto; funciona con agua y unos cuantos compuestos orgánicos; es suave y bastante bonito; resulta convenientemente móvil y flexible; se reproduce con entusiasmo; cuenta chistes, siente afecto y sabe apreciar una encendida puesta de sol y una refrescante brisa. ¿Cuántas máquinas conoce que sean capaces de hacer algo de eso? No hay ninguna duda: somos una auténtica maravilla. Pero hay que decir que, entonces, también lo es una lombriz de tierra.2.Aunque lo hagamos casi todo mal, nuestro cuerpo nos mantiene y preserva. La mayoría de nosotros somos testimonio de ello de una u otra forma. Cinco de cada seis fumadores no contraer cáncer de pulmón. La mayoría de las personas que integran el grupo de los principales candidatos para sufrir ataques cardiacos no sufren ataques cardiacos. Se estima que cada día entre una y cinco de nuestras células se vuelven cancerosas, pero el sistema inmunitario las captura y las mata.Piense en ello. Un par de docenas de veces a la semana, que son más de mil veces al año, contraemos la enfermedad más temida de nuestra época y, en cada una de esas ocasiones, nuestro cuerpo nos salva. Desde luego, muy de vez en cuanto un cáncer se convierte en algo más grave y puede que nos mate, pero en términos generales los cánceres son raros: la mayoría de las células del cuerpo se replican miles y miles de millones de veces sin equivocarse. Puede que el cáncer sea una causa común de mortalidad, pero no constituye un suceso común en la vida.3.Antes se creía que la despigmentación probablemente tardaba entre 10.000 y 20.000 años en producirse, pero hoy, gracias a la genómica, sabemos que puede ocurrir mucho más deprisa, probablemente en solo 2.000 o 3.000 años.* Ya lo saben, si ustedes se van a vivir a un lado tropical y su hermano a un lugar helado, en apenas dos o tres milenios serán DE OTRA RAZA. Ergo: la ""raza"" es tan superficial que no existe.4. Jajaja. Genial.De manera similar, hasta ahora nadie ha conseguido explicar ni de lejos por qué se nos arruga la piel de los dedos cuando nos damos un baño prolongado. La explicación más frecuente es que las arrugas les ayudan a drenar mejor el agua y facilitan el agarre, pero en realidad eso no tiene mucho sentido: sin duda, las personas que más urgentemente necesitan tener un agarre son las que acaban de caer al agua, no las que llevan ya un tiempo en ella.5.A diferencia del resto del cuerpo, las palmas de las manos no sudan en respuesta al esfuerzo físico o al calor, sino únicamente a causa del estrés. Esa sudoración emocional es la que se mide en las pruebas del polígrado (detector de mentiras).6.Alrededor del 60% de los hombres son prácticamente calvos al cumplir los cincuenta, y a uno de cada cinco le ocurre a los treinta. Poco se sabe de ese proceso, pero sí sabemos es que una hormona llamada dihidrotestosterona tiende a desbaratarse un poco con la edad, haciendo que los folículos pilosos de la cabeza se cierren y que, en cambio, los más reservados de las fosas nasales y las orejas broten desesperadamente. La única cura conocida para la calvicie es la castración* La naturaleza es malvada, jaja, pero rigurosa. Por ahí leí que los transgéneros que van de mujer a hombre, se quedan pelados si les tocaba ser pelados. En ese caso el sexo elegido termina siendo más fuerte que el original, por así decirlo.7. Una de las veces que Bryson me hizo reír.El 80% del aire que respiramos es nitrógeno. Es el elemento más abundante en la atmósfera y es vital para nuestra existencia, pero no interactúa con otros elementos. Cuando respiramos, el nitrógeno del aire penetra en los pulmones y vuelve a salir de inmediato, como un comprador distraído que ha entrado en la tienda equivocada.8.El más habitual de nuestros posibles tropiezos virales no deseados es el resfrío común. Todo el mundo sabe que si se enfría es más probable que se resfríe (al fin y al cabo, por eso lo llamamos resfriado), pero hasta ahora la ciencia no ha podido determinar por qué ocurre eso, o incluso si realmente ocurre. No cabe duda de que los resfriados son más frecuentes en invierno que en verano, pero eso podría deberse únicamente al hecho de que pasamos más tiempo en espacios interiores y, en consecuencia, estamos más expuestos a las fugas y exhalaciones microbianas de los demás.9. Por esto su servidora toma antibióticos tarde mal y nunca.Ya en 1945, en su discurso de aceptación del Premio Nobel, Fleming advirtió que los microbios podían desarrollar fácilmente resistencia a los antibióticos si estos últimos se utilizaban de manera descuidada. Raras veces un discurso del Nobel ha resultado más profético.10. Awww y jajaja.El cerebro resulta ser, con mucho, el más costoso de nuestros órganos. Sin embargo, también es maravillosamente eficiente. Nuestro cerebro requiere solamente de unas 400 calorías diarias de energía, casi lo mismo que obtenemos ingiriendo una magdalena de arándanos. Intente hacer funcionar su ordenador portátil 24 horas con una magdalena y verá el resultado.11.El cerebro tarda mucho en formarse por completo. En la adolescencia, solo se ha completado el 80% del cableado cerebral (lo cual puede que no sea una sorpresa para los padres de adolescentes). Aunque la mayor parte del crecimiento cerebral se produce en los primeros dos años de vida y termina en un 95% a los diez, las sinapsis no están completamente interconectadas hasta que la persona tiene entre veinticinco y treinta años.Eso significa que, en la práctica, la adolescencia se prolonga hasta bien entrada la edad adulta. Mientras tanto, la persona en cuestión tendrá un comportamiento más impulsivo y menos reflexivo que sus mayores y asimismo será más susceptible a los efectos del alcohol. ""El cerebro adolescente no es solo un cerebro adulto con menos kilómetros"", escribía en 2008 la profesora de neurología Frances E. Jensen en Harvard Magazine.12.Probablemente haya pocas circunstancias más inesperadas en relación a nuestro cerebro que el hecho de que en la actualidad este resulte ser más pequeño que hace 10.000 y 12.000, y no poco. Concretamente, desde entonces el cerebro medio se ha reducido de 1.500 a 1.350 cm3, lo que equivale a eliminar una porción de cerebro del tamaño de una pelota de tenis.Esta diferencia no resulta nada fácil de explicar, puesto que sucedió en todo el mundo al mismo tiempo, como si todos nosotros hubiéramos acordado reducir los cerebros en virtud de un tratado. La creencia generalizada es que nuestro cerebro simplemente se ha vuelto más eficiente y capaz de concentrar un mayor rendimiento en un espacio más pequeño, de manera similar a los teléfonos móviles, que se han ido haciendo cada vez más solicitados conforme se han ido reduciendo de tamaño. Pero nadie puede demostrar que lo que ha ocurrido no es sencillamente que nos hemos vuelto más tontos.13.Broca (...) estaba convencido, pese a tener todas las evidencias en contra, de que las mujeres, los criminales y los extranjeros de piel oscura tenían cerebros pequeños y menos ágiles que los hombres de raza blanca y conducta honesta. Cada vez que Broca se topaba con alguna evidencia que contradecía esa opinión, la ignoraba aduciendo que seguramente adolecía de alguna deficiencia. Tampoco se mostró dispuesto a creer los resultados de un estudio realizado en Alemania que revelaba que, por término medio, los cerebro de los alemanes pesaban 100 gramos más que los de los franceses. Broca explicó aquella incómoda discrepancia sugiriendo que los sujetos franceses eran muy viejos cuando fueron evaluados y, en consecuencia, sus cerebros se habían encogido. (...) También tuvo problemas para explicar por qué a veces los criminales a los que se ejecutaba tenían cerebros grandes y decidió que sus cerebros se habían hinchado artificialmente debido al estrés del ahorcamiento. Pero la mayor indignidad de todas se produjo cuando se midió el propio cerebro de Broca tras su muerte y se descubrió que era más pequeño que la media.14.Experimentamos el mundo que nuestro cerebro nos permite experimentar.15. Cuando la ciencia dice cosas que alguna gente no quiere que diga.El descubrimiento más inquietante de Atwater - tanto para él mismo como para el mundo en general - fue que el alcohol era un producto especialmente rico en calorías y, en consecuencia, resultaba ser un eficiente combustible. Como hijo de clérigo y él mismo abstemio, le horrorizaba tener que informar tal hallazgo, pero como diligente científico consideró que su principal compromiso era con la verdad, por incómoda que resultara.Por tal motivo, fue rápidamente repudiado por su propia universidad, devotamente metodista y su ya desdeñoso rector.16.Sea lo que fuere que nos da el sueño, es algo más que un mero periodo de inactividad reparadora. Tiene que haber algo que nos lleve a ansiar ardientemente quedar a mercer de posibles ataques de bandido o depredadores: sin embargo, que sepamos, dormir no hace nada por nosotros que no pudiera hacerse igualmente estando despiertos, pero en reposo.Tampoco sabemos por qué pasamos gran parte de la noche experimentando esas surrealistas y a menudo inquietantes alucinaciones a las que llamamos sueños. Ser perseguidos por zombies o encontrarse inexplicablemente desnudos en una parada de autobús no parece, a primera vista, una forma especialmente reconstituyente de pasar las horas de oscuridad.17.El período más largo que alguien ha pasado sin dormir de forma voluntaria se produjo en diciembre de 1963, cuando un estudiante de secundaria de San Diego de diecisiete años llamado Randy Gardner logró mantener despierto durante 264,4 horas (once días y veinticuatro minutos) en el marco de un proyecto escolar de ciencias.Los primeros días fueron relativamente fáciles para él, pero poco a poco se fue volviendo irritable y sumiéndose en un estado de confusión hasta que toda su existencia fue una especie de alucinación borrosa. Cuando terminó el proyecto, Gardner se derrumbó en la cama y durmió catorce horas seguidas. ""Recuerdo que cuando desperté me sentía aturdido, pero no más que una persona normal"", le diría a un entrevistador de la cadena de la radio NPR en 2017. Sus pautas de sueño volvieron a la noramlidad y no sufrió secuelas visibles. Sin embargo, años después experimento un terrible insomnio, que él consideró una ""retribución kármica"" por su aventura juvenil.18.Curiosamente, lo cierto es que el sexo no es necesario y de hecho muchos organismos han renunciado a él. Los gecos, esos pequeños largartos verdes que en los trópicos es frecuente ver aferrados a las paredes como juguetes de baño provistos de ventosas, han eliminado por completo a los machos.Resulta una idea un tanto inquietante si eres hombre, pero el hecho es que resulta fácil prescindir de lo que aportamos a la fiesta de la procreación. Los gecos producen huevos que son clones de la madre, y estos se convierten en una nueva generación de gecos. Desde la perspectiva de la madre, esta es una solución excelente, ya que significa que se heredan el 100% de sus genes.Con el sexo convencional, cada pareja transmite solo la mitad de sus genes, y esa proporción se va reduciendo incesantemente con cada nueva generación: nuestros nietos tendrán solo una cuarta parte de nuestros genes; nuestros bisnietos, una octava parte y así sucesivamente. Si ambicionamos la inmortalidad genética desde luego el sexo constituye una forma muy poco apropiada de lograrlo. (...)Puede que el sexo diluya nuestra contribución personal a la posteridad, pero resulta excelente para la especie. Al mezclar y combinar genes, obtenemos variedad y esta nos proporciona seguridad y resiliencia. Hace que resulte más difícil que las enfermedades se propaguen a poblaciones enteras. También implica que podemos evolucionar: podemos conservar los genes beneficiosos y descartar los que impiden nuestra felicidad colectiva. La clonación produce lo mismo una y otra vez. El sexo produce a Einstein y a Rembrandt y también, obviamente, a un montón de idiotas.19. PROFÉTICO. Aunque más que profecía, es ciencia.Lo cierto es que en realidad hoy no estamos mejor preparados para afrontar un brote que cuando la gripe española mató a decenas de millones de personas hace cien años. La razón por la que no hemos tenido otra experiencia así no es porque hayamos estado especialmente atentos. Es porque hemos tenido suerte.20. Sobre Calment, la mujer más anciana (verificada) que ha habido hasta ahora.Calment también se benefició de uno de los acuerdos económicos más deliciosamente mal calibrados jamás hechos. En 1965, enfrentada a ciertas dificultades financieras, aceptó dejar su piso en herencia a un abogado a cambio de un pago mensual de 2.500 francos hasta su muerte. Como Calment tenía entones 90 años, parecía un trato bastante favorable para el abogado. Pero al final fue este el que murió primero, 30 años después de haber firmado el acuerdo y tras haber abonado a Calment más de 900.000 francos por un piso que nunca llegaría a ocupar.21.Algunas personas viven más de que teóricamente deberían, teniendo en cuenta las circunstancias. Como señala Jo Marchant en su libro ""Cúrate"", los costarricenses tienen solo una quinta parte de la riqueza personal de los estadounidenses y una atención médica más deficiente, pero aún así, viven más tiempo. Asimismo, los habitantes de una de las regiones más pobres de Costa Rica, la península de Nicoya, son los que más viven de todo el país, a pesar de que tienen tasas mucho más altas de obesidad e hipertensión. Además cuentan con telómeros más largos.La teoría es que tienen lazos familiares y relaciones más estrechos que les resultan beneficiosos. Curiosamente, se ha descubierto que si viven solos, o no ven a un hijo al menos una vez por semana, la ventaja de la longitud de los telómeros desaparece. Es un hecho extraordinario que tener unas relaciones buenas y afectuosas altere físicamente a tu ADN. De manera inversa, un estudio realizado en 2010 en Estados Unidos reveló que carecere de tales relaciones duplica el riesgo de morir de cualquier cosa.UF, UNA BIBLIA AL FINAL SAQUÉ DE CITAS. Jajaja."

It's a great book.Please consider checking out my Vlog: IG: WhereIsMayLing or Youtube: Diary of a Speed Reader. I am just starting these out and it would be amazing to have you take a look.p.1 I love that he has this beautiful staring place of his teacher who thinks it's cheap to recreate the body. But he actually goes through the 59 elements that make a person chemically. It's incredible. He settles on a little over $151k vs. the original estimate around $2-13. But the way he does is very cool and that's just the intro.p. 14 - The shout out to the book Living Color and the difficulty of skin color as an evolutionary thing to stop us from frying like sausage in the sun. Wow. I want to read this book now.p. 15 - He talks about the idea that flushing (which serves no other purpose) might be a way to demonstrate a fight response as a warning. Curious. Never thought about it, but interesting point.p. 21 - Dematoglyphics - this is what fingerprints are. adermatoglyphia - this is when you have no fingerprints. Fascinating. they don't actually totally know what purpose this serves. It is true that no two people have the same ones, which I still think is fascinating. They think it might have to do with sweat glands. But no one knows. p. 33 - ""Everyone knows that if you get chilled, you are more likely to catch a cold (that is why we call it a cold, after all), yet science has never been able to prove why - or even, come to that, if that is actually so."" We really don't know sh*t about a lot of stuff. He then talks about the idea that this is not a single illness, but a family of symptoms generated by a multiplicity of viruses. p. 36 - They talk about how virus findings are getting bigger and bigger. It then really argues that maybe we just don't know anything about this stuff. It's kind of true likely.p. 44 - They talk about the wide use of antibiotics, often when that is not even the solutions. They are used for Bronchitis even though it's not going to work and that's clearly stated. This makes us highly resistant, and the dev of drug is harder and more expensive.p. 48 - The mystery of the brain section is very cool. ""It makes up just 2% of our body weight but uses 20% of our energy.""Apparently no matter how hard you think, it uses the same amount of energy.p. 63 he talks about ""glia cells"" and how much we have no clue what they do even though they are most of what is going on in the brain. Oh man. It's amazing we feel so advanced given what we really just don't know.p. 74 -This story of craniometry and all of the weird ways that this was used to be super racist. He doesn't present it that way, which I think is him skating the edge of a very broad audience. p. 76 - Paul Eckman's work on microexpressions - ""flashes of emotion, no more than a quarter of a second in duration, that betry our true inner feelings regardless of what our general, controlled expression in conveying."" He says we miss them, but can be taught to spot them.p. 104 - This work on food throughout, while interesting is not as thorough as I would like it to be. It's ok. Other books might be stronger. I think we still don't quite know enough about nutrition.p. 137 - Interesting story about stents. I think I want to learn more. p. 140-141 - He talks about the idea that the hormone Insulin and the way in which we have no clue about how all the hormones work together. He later says that we thought all the hormones were produced in a few glands, but there is literally almost no organ that doesn't produce hormones including fat. We know like nothing.p. 145 - Things like Addison's disease and the weirdness of what cortisol is doing. It's like we don't understand that the body is an ecology.p. 146 Leptin - our bodies are built to deal with scarcity not abundance. We have all these natural things that get us to eat. p. 182 - I'm not 100% sure why he included this on fat people spend 2.5 hours less than skinny people on their feet. You could have excluded this entire section as weight-loss is really something that people are mostly still guessing about. I do like that he says that drs are now saying that the extra weight is likely a good thing.p. 189 - Adenosine is responsible for energy in our cells (btw.. it's also responsible for making us sleepy).p. 191 - He talks about how our bones could only possibly support certain heights. Like it's the wrong material if we were going to be the size of a dinosaur or has he puts it the giants in Gulliver's Travels.p. 192 - This story about Alkemade who somehow survived dying in crazy circumstances more than once. Wow. I need to learn more about this guy's stories.p. 208 - Allergies are not genetic. They still haven't figured out what is going on here. Lots of guesses on hygene differences and all sorts of stuff.p. 213 - The whole section on sneezing is gross, but intriguing, especially given what's going on in current times. Gross, but intriguing.p. 214 - The section on breathing and how it's even more about getting rid of the CO2 than the oxygen intake. Good to know if you ever start to panic about drowning and explains a lot of my scuba training.p. 219 - Asthma as a primarily Western disease, i.e. far more incidence and possibly due to lifestyle. I'm not so sure about this or the whole television thing. I think it's just lack of healthcare, as Western societies live much more richly than poor ones. p. 239 - More people on the earth suffer from obesity than starvation. It use to be that people spent 1/2 their income on food. Now it's 6%. I don't think I have done enough work on how people spend disposable income across different income brackets globally.p. 244 - The salt thing. I think it might be a little bit off. Each country is a little different on diet and their body issues. Like part of the salt thing is that people also don't hydrate.p. 252 - The food poisoning thing is real. And it's not talked about. p. 280 Men do not think of sex every 7 seconds. Apparently, it's more like 19x per day College women think about food more than sex. Interesting. p. 291- wow... women use to start their period in the 1900s at age 15, not it's 12. EEK!!!p. 332 - He's taling about how dangerous just the flu is. Wow. Good timing. p. 337 - They talk about cancer and how it's totally non-infectious and basically is your body killing you (suiciding on you) without telling you about it. p. 338 - He talks about how lifestyle stuff is a big deal as relates to cancer. Not sure if that's true, but I would like to really have that proven out.p. 353 - He shows clearly the opposite of Sapiens and precisely how the world has gotten better and lives are far longer. p. 357 He talks about the stats across countries. Like in Norway people are less likely to die than in the US off of any given illness. EEK!!p. 368 - in 2011, more people die of non-communicable diseases than of actual infectious diseases. Wow. He's saying the former is more lifestyle oriented (heart-attacks, cancer, etc). I think he means it more like the only known solutions are lifestyle changes, not in the blame way. p. 372 - He's talking about the aging process and how we are starting to address that and get a handle on it.p. lots of great books in the sources to learn more.

132,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,Rating 4 out of 5,"Bill Bryson is a gifted author for presenting profound concepts fully suffused with humour. He does this often so effortlessly that the readers cherish the opportunity to read one of his books. I am really a fan of him, having read many of his other works. This book is about the human body, the long-suffering servant of the soul. The various subsystems and functions of the body are examined in a light-hearted and appealing way. It deals with birth and death, organs from the skin to the brain, activities like breathing and digestion and how we came to acquire the knowledge of them historically. This book is the easiest way for a lay reader to comprehend what is going on inside and outside our frame and more importantly, to marvel at the working of this wonderful artifact of eons of evolution. It is also to be noted that though the body appears to be arranged neat and tidy from the outside, the inside is haphazard and messy at times.The sense of awe and wonder one feels at the mechanisms that regulate various body parameters is immense. The way white blood cells attack pathogens, how dead cells are replenished in many organs but not all, the mechanism of hearing or vision are all so complicated that people who ascribe an all-powerful creator behind this magic may reasonably be pardoned. You see Bryson exclaiming with wonder, “and you can appreciate what an accomplished creation we are”! You should forgive the author for the remark on ‘creation’ which is used here only as a figure of speech. Bryson is devoted to evolution as the raison d’etre of all lifeforms. He calmly explains how the miraculous functions of a human body part are only an extension of a comparable organ in animals more closely related to humans. It is this solid foundation on modern rational thought that makes this work a pleasure to read. With this underpinning on science, you feel confident to recommend the book to others, especially with impressionable minds.We know that modern science has collected a vast amount of knowledge about the human body, especially on its response to extreme stimulants over the centuries. The author notes that some of it might have come from the gruesome clinical experiments carried out by Nazi doctors on their unfortunate Jewish prisoners or that by Japanese military physicians on Chinese and other prisoners of war during World War II. In Nazi Germany, healthy prisoners were subjected to amputation or experimental limb implants in the hopes of finding better treatments for German casualties. Russian prisoners were plunged into icy water to determine how long a German pilot could survive a downing at sea. Some experiments were driven by nothing more than morbid curiosity. In one, the subject’s eyes were injected with dyes to see if their eye colour could be permanently changed. In fact, many doctors were not forced to perform such experiments, they just volunteered.Bryson not only asserts that evolution is the only plausible mechanism that could bring about the complexity in lifeforms, but attacks Intelligent Design with examples of inconsistencies and ‘not-so-intelligent’ design. If ever there was an event that challenged the concept of Intelligent Design, it is the act of childbirth, in which a large head is passing through a much smaller constriction which came about as a byproduct of bipedalism. The author quips that ‘no woman, however devout, has ever in childbirth said, “Thank you, Lord, for thinking this through for me”. Then, there is a slight inconsistency in the narrative, which, if not cleared by experts would confuse the readers much. The book claims that the moment of birth is quite a miracle. In the womb, the foetus’ lungs are filled with amniotic fluid, but with exquisite timing, at the moment of birth, the fluid drains away, the lungs inflate and blood from the tiny heart is sent on its first circuit around the body (p.299). But in the caption to a colour plate of a foetus of six weeks, it is said that its heart is beating at hundred beats per minute. Is it circulating amniotic fluid through the veins at that time?This book provides clear warnings for health-conscious readers. Coconut oil is said to be essentially nothing but saturated fat in liquid form. It may be tasty, but it is no better than a big scoop of deep fried butter (p.244). This is indeed very bad news for people in Kerala where we know of no other oil than that which is extracted from the hardy coconut and used for practically all purposes like bathing, cooking, cosmetics and others. The text also includes detailed description of diseases that affect us and the precautions that can be taken against them. The pharma industry’s relentless pursuit of finding cures for diseases is also commented upon. However, the author leaves a hint that many germs have by now attained resistance to common antibiotics and future diseases could become more virulent. He warns that the reason we haven’t had another disastrous experience like the Spanish Flu isn’t because we have been especially vigilant, but because we have been lucky (p.335). It is a strange coincidence that just a few months after the publication of this book, Covid 19 struck the world with a devastating trail of death and misery.One sad fact you’d observe in this latest book from Bryson is the absence of his immensely enjoyable humour. Every page of his previous books had made the readers smile with witty remarks, but not this one. This book is definitely valuable, but only for the tons of useful information packed between its covers and arranged in meaningful chapters. It rightly deserves the epithet of a popular science book, but that’s not the richly fulfilling experience a reader expects from Bryson. Anyhow, the personal touch can still be felt, and the last paragraph would make you ponder on the meaning of life itself. It runs like this: ‘The average grave is visited only for about fifteen years, so most of us take a lot longer to vanish from the earth than from others’ memories. If you are cremated, your ashes will weigh about two kilograms. And that’s you gone. But it was good while it lasted, wasn’t it?’The book is highly recommended."

This was a solid read!In this book, Bill Bryson goes through all of the major functions of the body, from the skin, to your brain, to all the way to death. It was a fun read, and really accessible! What I liked the most was getting to know more about how things got discovered about our bodies, and learning about those scientists' lives. It was interesting to see how certain discoveries were mere accidents, and thus changed the world! All really fascinating stuff. This is a book I think I will be coming back to just to reread these interesting facts over again. One thing I will say is that I found that this book was a tad UK and USA biased, in a way that many of the facts that were displayed here were compared and contrasted with UK and USA stats. But, there were other parts that had interesting information from elsewhere in the world. The other criticism I have is that (and maybe this is a me thing) is that I kind of found myself already forgetting some of the interesting facts after finishing the book. Like, I feel like this book would've benefitted me way more if I annotated spots where I found interesting. But, I guess that just means I have an opportunity to come back to this book in the future!The audiobook was really good too. It's narrated by Bryson himself. The only thing that bothered me was that I was following along with my physical copy, and I noticed that there were many times where he would switch up the wording, or incorporate new material that's not in the printed copy in his narration. So there were so moments where I wasn't following along and just listened.There's not much else to write here since it quite literally is a book about the body. So, if you want to know more, just go and pick it up! :)"
134,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57560734-krystelle-fitzpatrick,Rating 4 out of 5,"What a fascinating book! This covers so much trivia and titbits about the human body without being overly complex and pretentious, and it’s so accessible. It covers biology section by section, with a couple of side alleys into infectious diseases and other such matters. I learnt SO MUCH from this book, and just followed my Oma around the house giving her little facts about the human body as I went. I’m fairly sure I’ll have to buy my science obsessed mother a copy as well as she’ll love it. I don’t know exactly what to specify about this book as such a delight- all of it was really interesting. I suppose if there was anything I’d improve upon, it would be a couple extra bits, like wisdom teeth and the appendix, and a couple of other bits and bobs, and maybe a bit more historical information. But while it’s a little surface sometimes, it’s still marvellous to read about the wonder that is all of us. "
135,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2328903-kristina,Rating 5 out of 5,"Very informative and fascinating book. If only we were lucky enough to have it as a Biology schoolbook, it was going to be perfect.I have so many highlights that I can probably do a trivia night.Bill Bryson is proclaiming many unknown heroes whose stories are just astonishing, and he is also explaining things that I never thought about, like for example, the method used to create a flu vaccine.My big takeaway is that in this age of rapid medical advancement, the human body is still a big unexplained marvel and there are so many things we don't have an answer for.I'm motivated to write an article with ""N facts from Bill Bryson's book 'The Body' that you would not believe"" and I'm a bit fearful of the volume it can easily reach."

The amount of information in this book is 100 times higher than all the books in last 10 years put together I read ...Everyday 2 hours that I have this book in last 20-25 days, was the best part of my day.During my schooldays I was the the kind of kid who just crammed answers of Biology to get some marks in exam and jump over the subject. I just wanted something like that which could let me understand the areas I avoided to actually understand in childhood.This book is not only useful in providing a very good insight on human body but also, it has very interesting (as well as entertaining) piece of information on Medical histories / Experiments behind various cures that we find normal in today's world.I loved reading this and will re-read it again soon.A highly recommended."

Everest summit attempts that should have been fascinating but even given the subject matter were somehow boring. Meanwhile, Bill Bryson writes 450 pages about the human body and every page is compelling. Human anatomy and biology is just something that has never interested me at all, but there were multiple times while reading this that I thought it would have been a great topic to study in school. Highly recommended if you've ever enjoyed one of Bryson's other books, enjoy human anatomy, or just like quirky nonfiction."
138,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1863589-robert-sheard,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5 stars, rounded upThis was actually far more readable and enjoyable than I would have thought, given its subject. But Bryson is a good stylist and can make even complicated scientific and medical ideas understandable for a lay-reader like me. This is essentially a tour through the body, outlining the history of what we've learned and how we've learned it about each subject. What's especially helpful is the number of readily believed ""truths"" that Bryson debunks along the way.The most frustrating chapter is the one on Medicine. In short, the USA healthcare system is a disaster of its own making through greed. For example, two objective facts:The USA, per person, spends 2.5 times as much on healthcare than the average of all other wealthy nations. And yet we rank just 31st in life expectancy. One has to wonder what we're getting for the outlandish costs.If nothing else comes out of the Coronavirus debacle in America, we should realize just how dysfunctional and corrupt our healthcare system is and fix it now."
139,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71924987-payel-kundu,Rating 3 out of 5,"I had pretty mixed feelings about this book. I’m a big fan of Bryson as a humorist. I value a good laugh over many other things in life, and Bryson is one of the funniest people I’ve ever encountered. The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt kid is possibly the funniest book I’ve ever read in my entire life. I came across my first Bill Bryson book on the dusty shelf of a house in which I was staying in Europe a few years ago, it was The Lost Continent, Travels in Small-Town America. That book had me in splits for the rest of my trip and brought me so much joy. I still quote it on road trips in America. In short, I think Bryson excels as an essayist, a travel writer, and a humorist in general. But he has this other big passion, to catalogue. I enjoyed a Short History of Nearly Everything, but I went into this book with a rather more critical scientific eye because as a neuroscientist, my education is in the life sciences. The tone and writing of the book were excellent and entertaining, we already know Bryson is a dynamite writer. This book was totally enjoyable. But factually, I’m not as convinced. The book is impressive in its scope and detail, especially for a non-scientist, and Bryson’s joy in learning the material comes through robustly. However the actual biological information contained in this book is kind of a hodgepodge. Some sections are really well nuanced and do a great job of citing good primary resources. For example, the section on leptin was presented better than many endocrinology texts I’ve read, making it clear that leptin is a hormone that is thought to signal a paucity of body fat when it is low, and stimulates appetite to remedy the situation. Leptin does not work as a supplement for overweight people, because above a certain threshold, it does not affect appetite appreciably. It did not evolve to signal as a regulator of excessive weight gain. The section on the prostate was also really well presented. Bryson discusses at some length the false positive rate of many preventative cancer screenings, PSA among them. This section mostly draws on the work of Richard J Ablin, who invented the PSA test, making him a very appropriate primary resource. But then, throughout the book Bryson does things like cite Daniel Lieberman extensively about things like the biochemistry of nutrition, even though Lieberman’s education is in anthropology. He’s not an expert on any of the fields Bryson cites him for, he just speaks about them accessibly, and as a result, much of the factual content of these sections is questionable. As a neuroscientist, I took special issue with the portion on neurogenesis over the lifespan. Bryson claims that it is hotly debated whether humans make new brain cells as we age. This is not true, there is a strong consensus in neuroscience that new neurons are formed throughout the lifespan. Bryson points to two opposing studies, one finding that new neurons were made in the hippocampus, and others finding that they were not. This is a misinterpretation of the second study, which actually found that the new neurons in the hippocampus were formed elsewhere and migrated into the hippocampus. Additionally, he claims that whether or not we make new neurons is sort of a moot point because it is nowhere near enough to compensate for the rampant neuronal loss we experience with aging. This is completely untrue and based on studies largely conducted in the 1950’s-1970’s which did not correct for volumetric changes in the aging brain. The best evidence to date says that there is no significant neuronal loss associated with normal aging, or that we lose perhaps 2-4% of neurons over the lifespan in normal aging. While there is some shrinkage of neuronal outgrowths, cell loss is not typical outside of pathological conditions like Alzheimer’s disease. In short, this book is interesting, funny, and a charming read. But if something in it seems radical or hard to believe to you, I’d encourage investigating other primary sources of info about that topic. "
140,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30833806-paul,Rating 4 out of 5," I think for most of us Bill Bryson is an author we tend to associate with travel writing. I myself have spent a good few hours lost in his books. Throughout out, I have always been able to learn something of the places he has been to and also had a good laugh. This time he has turned his attention to a place a little closer to home. For all the time we spend in them, most of us know little about how the function. We all often take it for granted that they are doing what they are supposed to. Within this book, Bryson set out to give us a better understanding of just how our bodies work and for that matter keep working. The book is broken up into chapters dealing with different aspects of the human body. His aim seems to be to give us a brief understanding of each of there functions and at times how they can go very wrong. For me, this was a book that is a step or two up from your school textbooks. He gave me a better way to get into the material. In the process breaking down some of the bigger biological processes into much easier bites. More than once I was left feeling surprised at my own very limited knowledge on the subject. I think I can know peel off a great many facts to share with others. But as he admits for all we know of the human body we still have a great deal to learn. There are great swaths of information missing from our understanding. The human body is one of the most complex things and with each passing day, there are people out there in search of answers to all the questions he raises.  For a book that is very complex at times, Bryson try's his best to bring it to us on a level we can all understand. But with any such book, there will always be a great deal of information to take in. I am usually a fairly quick reader, but even for me, this book took a few days to make my way through. This is not such a bad thing I was able to stop at a certain point to delve a little deeper online and to think about what he was telling me. I would point out that his usual level of humor is missing from this book. While it does pop up from time to time. I feel this is more Bryson the educates than bubbling adventure. And while a great deal of the books is given over to just how we function, he also delves into what happens when it all goes wrong. In doing so he does not shy away from race and gender. He does his best to show that while on some levels we are all the same, these two factors I mentioned play a big deal in not only how our bodies react to illness but how we are treated when going to the hospital. I think I should count my self lucky to have grown up in Britain whilst we may not be on the top of any charters we are certainly nowhere near the bottom.  Having finished the book I appreciate this will not be one for everyone. I think a lot of die-hard Bryson fans will struggle to make it through. For me it was a great book to read, I'm always looking to expand my knowledge on all subjects. And to find one that helps me better understand my self can not be bad at all. This nook was never going to fill in all the blanks, but if you want to either refresh what you know or are looking to get a foothold in the subject of the human body Bryson is your man. "

If you stopped to mark every interesting factoid, the entire book would be underlined. This must have been the easiest book in the world to write, especially for such a well-known and well-connected writer.   ***Going for regular walks reduces the risk of heart attack or stroke by 31 percent. An analysis of 655,000 people in 2012 found that being active for just eleven minutes a day after the age of forty yielded 1.8 years of added life expectancy. Being active for an hour or more a day improved life expectancy by 4.2 years. ***The fact is, you can quickly undo a lot of exercise by eating a lot of food, and most of us do. ***A study of eighteen thousand runners in Denmark concluded that people who jog regularly can expect to live five to six years longer on average than non-joggers. But is that because jogging truly is that beneficial, or is it because people who jog tend to lead healthy, moderate lives anyway and are bound to have improved outcomes over us more slothful types, with or without sweatpants? ***In one well-known experiment cited by the British academic Steve Jones, a test subject ran a marathon on a treadmill while the room temperature was gradually raised from minus 49 degrees Fahrenheit to 131 degrees Fahrenheit—roughly the limits of human tolerance at both extremes. Despite the subject’s exertions and the great range of temperatures, his core body temperature deviated by less than one degree over the course of the exercise. ***As an experiment, we asked a lady who was completely blind—she had lost her rods and cones as a result of a genetic disease—to tell us when she thought the lights in the room were switched on or off. She told us not to be ridiculous because she couldn’t see anything, but we asked her to try anyway. It turned out she was right every time. Even though she had no vision—no way of ‘seeing’ the light—her brain detected it with perfect fidelity at a subliminal level. She was astonished. We all were.” ***As the American academic Marlene Zuk has put it, “Old age is not a recent invention, but its commonness is.”"

I first read A Short History of Nearly Everything when it came out, and I was stunned at how much I understood and liked science. I even understood string theory for a total of about six minutes. But it was something!I have been on the Bryson tip since then, usually with rewarding results. I have loved his books on travel, the English language, Shakespeare, and more. I couldn’t quite get into At Home, but I think I might want to retry that one, because I loved this book. It does everything that a listicle will do for your sense of understanding, but probes deeper and casts a wider net. It is so much more interesting than those pithy articles from the Internet.We get to almost all of it: birth and death, sight and taste, emotion and sex. Some of the historical names get lost in the morass, but that doesn’t matter so much if, when you’re reading it, it compels you this deeply. And indeed it compels, giving us history of communicable diseases, the dividing line between when a zygote becomes a baby, and how, exactly, my color blind eyes work.There should be a tendency to get grim. There are so many statistics, so many I don’t knows, that it might be simpler for Bryson to simply shrug and say science doesn’t know much. But one of Bryson’s strengths is that he loves to follow footnotes to sources. The Body is thorough; but that doesn’t mean it’s dry. I listened to the audiobook read by Bryson himself. I love his orating voice, and the way he emphasizes certain words in his half-British/half-American accent. He is very good at what he does here, in both delivery and content. If you really like Brysons earlier work, I highly recommend trying this one out. You won’t regret it."

Tampoco del espacio doméstico y sus particularidades. Esta vez es sobre el espacio interior, su estructura y funcionamiento en una carrera frenética de quinientas páginas mas cien de apéndices y notas. Nos cuenta lo sorprendente de nuestro organismo y nos recorre por la historia de la medicina para resaltar los grandes progresos, los difíciles retos pendientes y las tendencias preocupantes. El libro es de Octubre de 2019, así que el capítulo sobre epidemias resulta ligeramente tener un humor negro al decir que no se sabe cuándo la siguiente ‘grande’ está a la vuelta de la esquina.El libro es espléndido para repasar las clases de educación para la salud, y también para recordar una larga caterva de libros de divulgación muy populares, cuyas principales ideas se vuelven a exponer aquí (Sapiens, Nacidos para Correr, Blink, Pensar Rápido/Pensar Despacio, El Emperador de todos los Males, Por qué dormimos, Glup, De Matasanos a Cirujanos, La Mujer Invisible, Ser Mortal, Hasta las Cenizas). El único punto menos es algo que me imagino es característica de Bryson: Es. Demasiada. Información. No recuerdo prácticamente nada de En Casa, el único otro libro que he leído de él, y aquí fuera de lo que ya sabía no creo que recuerde mucho. De todas formas es no ficción apasionante."

Since reading it, I have frequently included a Bryson book or two in my yearly reading and have suggested them to others. The Body is sure to be another book I will regularly recommend (and in fact already have).The book itself winds through the system's of the body one after another. Bryson discusses what makes up the system, the important discoveries and discovers of parts in the system, always with an eye toward what makes for a good story. Finishing with the systems, he moves on to the functions of the body, illness and causes of disease, and finally death. Even knowing a good amount about anatomy and scientific history, I found myself learning while reading things book. This was particularly true when he discussed new research and interviews with scientists on the cutting edge of physiology or disease research. However, don't mistake this as a boring textbook. While this does not contain the wit and sarcasm of his travelogues or even Brief History, Bryson has a style of writing that keeps you engaged and reading well past the time when you should have gone to bed. I recommend this book for anyone interested in anatomy in particular or science as a whole. You are sure to learn something and have fun doing it. Thank you to the publisher and Netgalley for the opportunity to read a pre-release copy this book."
146,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I imagine Bill Bryson standing in front of a mirror doing his thing, with a sudden moment of clarity one day--I know nothing at all about this body of mine. Let me find out more. This book is what I imagine would be the outcome of that moment. This is a sweeping and wide-ranging account of your body from head to toe (with cameos by the various non-human organisms that make us who we are). Bryson chooses to focus on facts and stories--what we know, and how we came to know this, which makes for some very engaging stories. Some themes recur throughout--how a lot of what we assume is common knowledge is myth (8 glasses of water a day, using only 10% of our brain, our body having 10 times more microbes as human cells), how we cannot trust corporates to do the right thing (the opioid crisis, the food industry shoving bad things down our throats, the lobbying by the tobacco industry), and just how little we truly understand when we dig deeper (how does an itch arise?) It's a tome for sure, but the length feels just right. If there was anything I had a problem with, it was the author's focus on the White world--there is a touch of Euro/America centrism that feels outdated in this age. "

I normally finish a book in 2 days and this took me 25 days to finish because I kept putting it down. He lists some facts about each area of the body and the scientists that studied it, whether those facts are interesting or not. Sometimes he gets into the subject matter and briefly writes in an engaging way, but most of the time it reads like a list of bullet points he jotted down while reading something else. He cribs very heavily from Mary Roach's works and always gives her credit but trust me, it's more fun and engaging to read her amazing books directly instead of this summary of Bill's. It's tedious, I felt like most of the facts were obvious things I learned in primary school or summaries from better books I had already read, and found his super repetitive negative comments about fat people a bit hypocritical and mean. I've already had 2 of my home library clients return it and say they didn't like it and couldn't finish it, so I am not going to recommend it to anyone. "

I am biased because in my imagination Bill Bryson is a friend with whom I chat often and from whom I learn all sorts of fascinating things. In reality, Mr Bryson is an author whom I’ve never met but who entertained me for the last two and a half months with facts about the human body that I have repeated aloud so often to friends and family that every time they find my words interesting they ask me if I learned it from “your Body Book”. Most of the time the answer was yes. I learned so many things in each and every chapter. Perhaps the most important to me was that a person cannot “undo sitting” or negate its detrimental effects on the body by activity or exercise. As a result of this singular fact, I read many of these 400 pages while standing. True fact. This is one of those books that at the end I am better off, mind and body, as it happens, for having read!"

It's much more accurate, up-to-date AND extremely interesting. I feel that I have learnt more about human body than I ever did during all my school years (a long time ago). The author gives us a tour of the human body through all its systems such as integumentary system, nervous system and respiratory system. We explore the role of every single element of the body, we learn about how we came to have the current medical knowledge and what we are still missing, as well as about everything that can go wrong in the marvelous yet imperfect machine that the human body is.The author focuses a lot on people to whom we owe everything we know today. Many of the geniuses that propelled the medical knowledge forward were often very flawed or outright horrible people outside of their profession. It gives perspective on the people that refuse to read extraordinary books written by morally doubtful writers. It's about separating people from their work.What I found the most terrifying just how much we still don't know about our own bodies. We can do close to nothing about autoimmune diseases (which I was unfortunately already aware of, since I myself suffer from one), cancer and other things in pretty every single human system.There were also many facinating trivia facts, for example: - Autoimmune diseases are ""sexist"" and 80% of sufferers are women. - Many women needlessly die of heart attacks, because they are misdiagnosed due to the male bias in what we know about the symptoms (women often have completely different symptoms than men!). - The race, which has played and unfortunately still plays such a huge role in human history and modern time, is nothing but a thin layer of cells in the outer skin. - The idea of growing human organs in animals for transplanting gave a creepy Oryx and Crake vibe *shudders*. - Humans enjoy animal suffering. They torture animal in labs and they call it animal testing. The problem is that animals are different species than humans and they have very different metabolism, suffer from different diseases, etc. So people inflict horrible suffering on them, and there are no real benefits for humanity, apart from sadists enjoying themselves. And guess where a lot of worst diseases come from, including the biggest epidemics? Animal farming. Karma is a bitch. *munches on a vegan burger* Except we all suffer for the pleasure of meat-eaters' taste buds. - Cancerous cells appear in our bodies a few times a week and are promptly detected and destroyed by our immune system. Until they aren't. If we live long enough, we pretty much all get cancer. Scary…
Personal note
So this is a note for my future self, to give the interesting context in which I was reading this book. As I write this review, we are right in the middle of Covid-19 pandemic. I didn't plan on reading a medical non-fiction featuring diseases and epidemics now. I was waiting in the library queue for this book for a few months, long before anyone suspected what times we would find ourselves in. My hold finally arrived when the first news about unknown virus in China started spreading around the world. I got opportunity to read this book slowly instead of hurrying through (since renewal for popular books is not possible), because the national lock-down happened, the libraries closed from day to day and I was left with all my check-outs for unknown amount of time. As such, when I reached the chapter about infectious diseases, I was in my third (or fourth?) week of working from home, just as most of the people who were fortunate not to lose their jobs. And then this quotation came up: The fact is, we are really no better prepared for a bad outbreak today than we were when Spanish flu killed tens of millions of people a hundred years ago. The reason we haven't had another experience like that isn't because we have been especially vigilant. It's because we have been lucky.Well, it seems that our luck has finally run out…"

164,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56491386-kirsty,Rating 5 out of 5,"Like many readers, I very much enjoy Bill Bryson's non-fiction work.  I picked up his newest publication, The Body: A Guide for Occupants having not read any of his writing for such a long time, and was so pleased that I did.  I was reminded once more of how warm his prose is, and how fascinating his subjects.Many of Bryson's books are essentially travel writing, in which he writes about countries and regions which he has lived or travelled within - the United States, United Kingdom, and Africa are just three examples.  The Body is something a little different to these personal geographies, though.  It is far more science-based than much of his work, and does not include many personal stories, something which his books tend to be built upon.  It looks inward, trying to decipher what really makes a human being.The Body has been split into many chapters, each of which focuses upon a distinctive part of the human body.  These range from 'The Immune System' and 'The Brain' to 'Into the Nether Regions'.  These chapters are incredibly thorough; there is not an element of the body which has not been explored in some way.  He moves seamlessly from one topic to another.  With his chapter on the skin, for instance, he moves from bacteria found on the skin to the phenomenon of itching, and then the reasons as to why we lose hair as we age, all in less than two pages.Bryson writes about so many things here, including the beginning of forensic science; microbes and proteins, and their functions and uses within the body; viruses; advances in medicine; evolutionary changes within human anatomy; how different parts of us age, and the consequences felt; the myriad benefits of exercise; and the wonder found within the structure of our bones.  He writes about so many things that are known about the human body, and also the surprising number of elements which remain a mystery.  Bryson introduces several medical conundrums, interesting cases which cannot be solved.Bryson has chosen to begin The Body with rather a fascinating chapter, entitled 'How to Build a Human', which calculates how expensive it would be to procure all of the elements which make up the human body - clue: a lot.  This memorable prologue, as it were, sets the tone for the book, and feels perfectly placed.As ever, Bryson's writing in The Body is both absorbing and accessible.  He grapples with complex ideas throughout the book, but presents everything in a way which can be read and understood by newcomers to this subject.  He introduces myriad facts in marvellous ways, which really make one think; for instance, 'In the second or so since you started this sentence, your body has made a million red blood cells.'  One can see from the outset that Bryson clearly has quite a passion for this subject, and this shines throughout, as does his humour.  Throughout, Bryson consults experts in different fields, and also mentions a lot of books which focus upon biology along the way.The Body is a book which one can learn, unsurprisingly, a great deal from.  I have always been fascinated by biology and the human body, and have read a few books on the subject before, but I found myself learning new facts throughout.  Although there is such a great deal packed into the pages of The Body, and a great deal of impeccable research has clearly been done, it never feels saturated with information, and can easily be read from cover to cover.  The Body is, all in all, a fact-lover's dream, which demonstrates how wonderful the human body is, in all of its strangeness.I will end this review with a passage which I, personally, found fascinating: 'The most remarkable part of all is your DNA.  You have a metre of it packed into every cell, and so many cells that if you formed all the DNA in your body into a single fine strand it would stretch ten billion miles, to beyond Pluto.  Think of it: there is enough of you to leave the solar system.  You are in the most literal sense cosmic.'"

167,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3049657-victoria,Rating 4 out of 5,"I have read - and enjoyed - several of Bryson's earlier books, so his name always catches my eye. This one, his latest, is not at all a memoir, but instead a rather comprehensive view of human biology. This overview touches on many subjects - from the specifics of diseases, impacts of lifestyle choices, details on how organs function alongside quick biographical highlights of many Novel prize winners and others who have made significant discoveries in medicine and deepening your understanding of your own body.There is a lot crammed into this volume - with many interesting footnotes, anecdotes and facts that are fun to share as you read along. The chapters are clearly broken down by subject and though there are a few references to information revealed in later or earlier chapters, for the most part, there isn't even a reason to read this consecutively (so if you are the most interested in the heart - start there!). I think this would be a perfect book to slowly read - a friend of mine mentions that she has a few books always on the go like that (one on her nightstand for just before bed reading, another in the car for reading while waiting on her kids in the pick up line). Because I did read it consecutively, without breaks, it did stand out that Bryson really stressed the poor health of America over his adopted country of Great Britain. I don't think this would have been as obvious had I read this more slowly, over a longer period of time. It is an interesting read and one that definitely feels well-researched. I can see this as a nice addition to your home reference library. And I am curious to see what direction Bryson will go in next. "

He discusses practices to help an individual live a healthy, quality of life such as couch potatoes (those sitting six or more hours a day) can benefit by walking around during commercials to burn 180 calories an hour or just standing to burn 107 calories an hour. Recommendations by the World Health Organization such as the daily recommendation for sugar intake is a maximum of five teaspoons are also presented. A muliitude of diseases have come and gone, only to replaced by another disease such as the Heartland virus in 2018. Now there is the Coronavirus which is new since the publication of The Body. How operations have evolved over the years with some horrendous descriptions of earlier operations such as the mastectomy of Fanny Burney, an English novelist, in 1810. Bryson reiterates Daniel E. Lieberman, professor of human evolutionary biology at Harvard: belief that 70 percent of the diseases that kill us could easily be preventable if we would just live sensibly."
170,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4449127-emily,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 starsAdvance copy provided by NetGalley.At the beginning, I was a bit overwhelmed by the waterfall of facts descending upon me, but once I settled into his style, I really enjoyed this. Besides the abundance of facts about human anatomy, a subject I felt I needed to learn more about, there’s fascinating medical history and biographical information about pioneers in the field of medicine. What struck me most in this book is that so many discoveries and theories that are common knowledge today were initially rejected. Scientists whose ideas were initially met with scorn were later awarded Nobel prizes. Another rather chilling recurring theme of the book is how little we know about the body, aging, and diseases, even in this modern age when we’re supposed to have it all figured out (right?). His notes and bibliography at the end are impressive, and I plan to use the latter as a source for future reading material. There’s a lot of territory to cover, so nothing is terribly in-depth, but the book is an interesting, thought-provoking overview of what we know so far about what makes us tick."

Timing is everything and I was the first person to check it out at my library! The book is filled with amazing facts and stories about how the human body works, medical science, and the history of medicine. The author's particular writing style, relaying all these science facts within anecdotal stories, is what makes it so entertaining and fun to read. And it definitely helps with my retention of scientific information, especially as I get older! Several parts of the book were devoted to the brain, memory and aging, so, yes, I am sure I was his target audience! My main take-away from this book is despite all our advances and increased knowledge of the human body, we really know so little and so much of what we know is still theory and guesswork. I highly recommend The Body. It reminds me of Mary Roach's writing style. I will be looking out for more books by Bill Bryson."

173,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9640539-becky-diamond,Rating 5 out of 5,"Bill Bryson is a gifted writer, deftly melding facts with wit to expose humorous aspects of the human condition and the world around us. As a result, he can unpack any topic into the most fascinating thing you’ve ever read. The Body: A Guide for Occupants is no exception. Each chapter focuses on a body part or process, similar to the format of his book At Home focusing on the house and its functions. As with his other books, he has a knack for tracking down mind-boggling statistics and facts. So while some of these you may recall from biology class, he manages to find other intricate details and relays them in a clear, witty manner. And while we have come such a long way in learning and discovering the body's inner workings, there's much that's still a mystery to medical science. I just kept thinking, ""Wow - this is the place that houses all of my thoughts, feelings and physical attributes and there's still so much I don't know about it."" We truly are a work in progress."

After that, it becomes a slog through each body system in turn, with fact after fact piling up, none of it very thorough. For better writing about gut microbes, read Ed Yong's wonderful _I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life_. For better writing about sex and reproduction, read Mary Roach's _Bonk_ or _Everything Below the Waist: Why Health Care Needs a Feminist Revolution_. For better writing about humanity's upright gait and long-distance running capacity, read _Born to Run_. Basically, for every topic covered superficially here, there's a better, more entertaining book. That said, this is a *great* survey of the major systems, and I'll be happy to let my kids read it when they're ready for such a good overview."

The Body is a useful, approachable exploration with memorable stories (in particular, I feel like I will remember every astonishing story from the sleep chapter for a long time), but with less of the humor and lightness that some of his other books possess. Still, it's an accessible enough read that I can recommend it for my students, and it inspired me to take better care of my own body, so overall, that's a win.Thanks to the publishers and NetGalley for the digital ARC."

Filled with both facts and interesting historical and contemporary stories, this was a great read. It’s amazing to me how much we have no knowledge of - or guesses at best.As others have noted, not for the squeamish or those bothered by descriptions of sickness/disease/etc. I’m generally not a squeamish person, but one woman’s first-hand account of her 1810 mastectomy was extremely difficult to read.Unfortunately, the gender binary is very much enforced, especially in the chapter on reproductive organs. I wonder if this is a reflection of the comparatively small amount of scientific research on gender as a spectrum. I think it would have been good to at least mention the concept of being trans though."

Somehow, finding the humor in things that seem to not have a jot of it brings out the best in yourself and can calm you down.Anyways, that being said, there are facts galore in this look at what makes you you that may or may not distress you.

And we excrete millions of red blood cells a day. Wow!It’s a long book and sometimes I skimmed a bit of the history having to do with the researchers/discoverers of certain theories/drugs/genes/diseases/etc. but it was a very smooth blend of “here’s how this discovery in 1865 got us to where we are today”.

He's a wonderful author with an amazingly articulate and witty voice. This particular book is jam-packed with facts, to the point where I had to read it one chapter at a time or my brain would get overwhelmed. It's a dense book and might be a slow read, but Bryson's voice gives it life in a way that other authors would lose my interest. He keeps it witty and engaging the entire time. "

I loved learning about the science that makes us human, and I still do! Thus, The Body: A Guide for Occupants, was a real winner with me.

This book needed to choose one or the other, or it needed to tell it all. As it is, it seems stuck in the middle. I wanted more stories and anecdotes.

Keho on tuttua Brysonia: kova faktapommitus, jossa käydään läpi ihmiskehon toimintaa alue kerrallaan ja siinä sivussa paljon lääketieteen historiaa.Se onkin melko värikästä tavaraa se, monia asioita on selvitetty nykynäkökulmasta varsin kammottavin menetelmin. Sanotaan nyt vaikka niin, että minulle ei kyllä tulisi mieleeni katetroida itseäni ihan kokeillakseni, pääseekö olkavarresta katetrilla verisuonia pitkin sydämeen. Tällaista kaikkea herkullisen kammottavaa ja groteskia pikkufaktaa kirja on pullollaan, joten herkimpiä varmasti ällöttää ja muut pääsevät nauttimaan mukavista puistatuksista.Bryson nostaa ansiokkaasti esiin monia unohdettuja tutkijoita, joiden työstä joku toinen on vienyt kunnian, tai muuten vain unohduksiin jääneitä hienoa työtä tehneitä lääketieteen edistäjiä. Toisaalta Bryson ei myöskään arkaile nostaa esiin lääketieteen heikkouksia, kuten sitä, että pitkään oli oikeastaan turvallisempaa pysytellä loitolla lääkäreistä, tai miten moderni lääketiede ei monessakaan kohdassa – etenkään Yhdysvalloissa – tuota käytettyä rahaa vastaan mitenkään erityisen hyviä tuloksia.Keho on oikein mainio kirja sekalaisen faktatiedon ystäville.

Jednak Bill Bryson zaspokoił moją ciekawość, zawarł mnóstwo nowych dla mnie faktów i podał je w mój ulubiony sposób, czyli z tak zwanym tłem historycznym.To, co szczególnie cenne, to pokazanie jak postęp medycyny rodzi się w bólach i powstaje z pomyłek, jak wielu ma rodziców, często walczących o sławę i uznanie zupełnie nie po dżentelmeńsku. Bryson przytacza w książce wyniki najnowszych badań ale przyznaje też wielokrotnie, że pewne zjawiska nie są dobrze zbadane, funkcjonowanie organów bardziej skomplikowane, a w medycynie nadal jest więcej pytań niż odpowiedzi.

197,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1237742-sharon,Rating 5 out of 5,"In his Bill Bryson breezy prose, the author has chosen the human body as the subject for this tome and because that’s just the way he writes, it’s eminently readable - and enjoyable. I found myself saying Huh or outright laughing on many occasions. For instance, “Ollivere gently incised and peeled back a sliver of skin about a millimeter thick from the arm of a cadaver. It was so thin as to be translucent. ‘That,’ he said, ‘is where all your skin color is. That’s all that race is —a sliver of epidermis.’” That got a Huh from me when I first read it and another Huh as I reread it just now.When he divulges information, he adds a example that we can relate to illustrate his point. For instance when he tells us that the region of the forebrain is associated with pleasure which grows to its largest size in teen years. “That is why the sensations you feel as a teenager are more intense than at any other time of life. But it also means that seeking pleasure is an occupational hazard for teenagers.” Instantly I thought of my son and the impulsive things he had done with bad outcomes. And I had to read that part out loud to my husband. In fact, I had to read out loud to him on several occasions. I’m sure he’s glad I’ve finished the book.There are factoids scattered though the chapters, like how MSG got it’s bad reputation. We read about the rise in diabetes throughout the world which probably comes as a surprise to no one. But who knew that that type I diabetes in Finland has risen 550 percent since 1950 and continues to rise almost every where else at a rate of 3-5 percent. No one knows why. Huh!Or that people who had their tonsils removed while young have a 55% great chance of having a heart attack in later life. Really?!!I thoroughly enjoyed this book, as I do all of Bryson’s books, and if you’re wondering how a book on the human body could be engaging, take my word for it. It is."

Several copies of, ""the flight attendant who survived a fall of 33,000 ft, cushioned by fir trees; the Spanish diver who held his breath for 24 minutes."" Bet you didn't know this one: a study of 60 people’s belly buttons found 2,368 species of bacteria, 1,458 of them “unknown to science.”Okay. Fun facts.My takeaway from this (I listened to the CD audiobook edition, wryly narrated by Bryson) is yes, the sheer beauty of our bodies, the wonderful safeguards, fail-safes that our being transmit to us...and the mind-body connection. Sometimes those transmissions are outright red neon warnings, such as, ""not one more bite...I'm full!""So much of our healthcare culture is waiting for the next miracle drug. Funding the latest screening device or test. Traveling long distances to the highest rated and marketed care facility. Then, who pays for all this?Yet, our bodies, our minds, our innate feelings counsel and guide us every moment. Bryson lets this mantra of self knowledge, self direction, bubble up and float through his book. We all know the placebo effect. It's in here. People reported feeling better after taking a placebo, even after being told beforehand, it's a placebo.Our bodies crave good health. Our bodies are designed and built to move. That same body will tell the occupant when to rest. How and when to nourish. How to educate the mind to detect and then act on these feelings better. The lessons are repeated until learned. Happy, sharing people live, as an average, longer.We just have to listen. "

I love the most his books on giant single subjects and yet I'm also always astonished when he comes up with a new area for those. The Body may be his best yet.As always, it's utterly filled with trivia, bizarre fact, and anyone with just a passing understanding of anatomy and medicine will find something fascinating every few minutes. Did you know that if all your DNA was made into a single strand and stretched out end to end, it was stretch past Pluto and out of the solar system? Did you know that most stutterers are left-handed? And that stuttering is much worse in those who are left-handed but were forced to learn to write right-handed? Did you know that we get 2-5 cancer cells every single day of our lives, which our immune systems get rid of? And that kissing is a surprisingly bad way to spread a cold? My husband doesn't have any idea how lucky he is that I listened to this book while I was out of town and he was spared a massive amount of gasping and me telling him interesting things endlessly (he still got a few). And you need to have no prior knowledge or interest in the subject at all--I nearly failed my high school biology class.Mr. Bryson narrates the book himself, and I know some people find him an annoying narrator, but I do not at all. He has developed a bit of a British accent and I find him charming. It's the best of both worlds where he sounds fancy and slightly foreign but he doesn't pronounce words like ""laboratory"" in that bizarre British way.I found the book utterly delightful, completely fascinating, and I wish it had been twice as long."

I read and enjoyed:"" A short walk"" & ""A sunburned country"", but I lost my patience with ""A short history of nearly everything"". I blame myself for that. What was I expecting? With this latest book, I have to say, it is not a book to read all the way through. It's probably the only book I'll ever recommend for those of you who like to have reading material accessible in the bathroom. You could read it in limited amounts of time and never run out of reading material or patience. It's really fascinating when taken in little bits at a time. For example did you know that if your lungs were stretched out and flattened they would cover a tennis court? And so on. But you can see why you wouldn't want to sit down and read it from start to finish or worse, listen to your partner reading it aloud to you in bed before you fall asleep which I guarantee you will not be long. For example, did you know that in 2018, a professor at Oxford found that low-dose aspirin is not effective at all in reducing cardiac or cancer risk in anyone weighing 154 pounds or more--but it does still post a serious risk of internal bleeding.etc.,etc.,etc. All good information in low doses.

If you enjoyed his previous books At Home and A Short History of Nearly Everything, then you'll also like this one. It's basically a fascinating, witty, and concise overview of the different systems that make up the human body, along with the diseases, viruses, etc. that plague us. As with all Bryson books, I loved his signature wit and the plethora of little known, captivating facts he includes. In fact, there were times when Bryson devoted only a single sentence to a particular fact, such as some unbelievable brain disorders (being convinced you're dead when you're really alive, being blind but sure you can see, etc.) that I wished he would have expanded on. Perhaps part of Bryon's brilliance, however, is in engaging the reader's curiosity and giving us plenty to ponder and research ourselves once the book is over. I know whenever I finish one of his books that I'm going to have a list of further reading and topics for discovery thanks to all the irresistible tidbits he mentions."

He has an easy, amusing writing style that always makes for pleasurable reading. There are many interesting facts in this book, but because I have read so many medical/disease/health care type books, there were also many things I had read before and already knew. The chapters on the brain and sleep were overviews for me since I have read a number of books on both subjects and the chapters in this book are rather short given the subject matter, but this book is attempting to cover all of the human body and so the chapters are necessarily short. The chapters on skin and hair, the heart and blood, and the skeleton are fascinating. This book is an interesting summary of most everything about our human bodies and is well worth reading. It is sprinkled with interesting anecdotes about various famous doctors, scientists, and patients that add greatly to the book as it documents the history of medical discovery about the human body and the advancement of that knowledge.

This one focuses upon the human body and does not shy away from any area. The information is, as always, exacting and delivered in such a way that understanding is guaranteed. You'll also be charmed by the little asides, stories, and interviews. The last section on cancer and death was excellent, if a somewhat depressing end to the book (I don't think it could have been avoided, much like death itself), and there was an air of reassurance about it.Some of the worst information you discover along the way is the awfulness of US healthcare statistics, and the awfulness of UK healthcare statistics (esp cancer survival) - for two very wealthy countries, something seriously needs to be change!Anyway, if you can cope with that, this book is an incredible read (listen) and I recommend it to everyone!"

As much as it seems like we already know our own bodies, there is so much that I had no idea about.Overall, this book favors breath over depth, which is fine. There are lots of other great books out there to dive into topics like microbiology of the stomach or aging or genetics, but this book did a great job of giving a high-level view while giving just enough detail to understand it without becoming overly complex or boring. And, on top of that, the author was super funny and made it enjoyable to learn about some topics that were difficult, like aging, death, and dementia.I'm super excited to read this book again in the future, and this book also referred me to many other books that I hadn't heard of before that I'll probably check out next.This book is probably my favorite of all the books I've read this year."

Second, I learned a LOT, and his tendency to explore immensely interesting bunny trails contributes mightily to the enjoyment. He never takes himself too seriously. I feel like he is a ""reader's author"". In other words, he makes great effort to make his books page-turners for the average reader like me.I won't summarize the book, you can get that from the jacket. Just be prepared to laugh while you learn an amazing amount - read ""The Body"" by Bill Bryson."

It is a very thourough summary of what happens in our bodies, with a lot of focus on what can go wrong. As usual some science history as well, and I have learned a lot of new things.But I have mainly learned that there is a lot that we don't know yet about how our body really works, and that we are a wonder of science. Also, it appears that being born and living in Europe has a lot of benefits when compared with living in the US. Good to know!I recommend it to everyone that likes science and science's history, people who like to know more and enjoy fun trivia. However, beware, if you have a tendencie towards hypocondria, nothing good will come from reading this. You will itch all over. "
208,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/340071-barbara,Rating 5 out of 5,"Bill Bryson is a natural and gifted teacher. I've said that before in at least one review, but it is worth saying again. He is better known for his humorous travel books but when he decides to cover a subject, I pay attention. In this case, he provides a class in physiology that is better and more understandable than anything I've read elsewhere. The information he is providing is up to date with everything I've seen recently and also what I've heard from my doctor. The big bonus was that I listened to an unabridged audiobook production and Bill Bryson read it. Unlike many authors, he is a very good narrator. I got the print book from my library to read over a few sections that I wanted to review. I actually would buy this as a reference book if my library didn't already own it."
209,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/854699-brian,Rating 5 out of 5,"In Bill Bryson's The Body, he talks about all aspects of the human body, literally from head to toe. He begins at the head, goes into the brain, the heart, the lungs, as well as almost every single major organ and aspect of our bodies. While this sounds like it can be an extremely dull topic, Bryson spices up the subject matter with interesting anecdotes, entertaining facts and just a relatability that can make anyone like and enjoy this book. Every chapter is equally entertaining and engaging. I thought this was a book that people should really try to read to learn more about what makes you you."

He’s known best for his science-related books, of course, so he is sure to please all of his fans with this latest offering. And what an offering it is! An homage to the great gift that is the human body, this narrative is filled with all of the facts – both fun and serious – you need to truly respect what The Body does for us.

The answer is that he handled the level of detail very well, he went into complex detail but didn't drown the reader. I found it engaging and very interesting and not a re-hash of standard quotes.I would thoroughly recommend this book, even to experts. It is well written and moves along very nicely."

I'd definitely recommend this one above some of the others I've done."

There are just so many interesting anecdotes and facts and they really are delivered well.The Body is a highly enjoyable and is very much worth a read."
214,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13091714-anna,Rating 4 out of 5,As usual for Bryson this brims with interesting facts and stories as we explore different systems and areas of the human body. Based on my previous reading on various of these areas some subjects are oversimplified and others overemphasized to an extent to give the reader a slightly skewed idea of the concept at hand. On the whole though this is a valuable work which dispels many common myths and educates readers on things they may not even have known they were missing.

Although it talked about human body from different perspective, I found both ""The Body"" and ""Stiff"" similarly fascinating. How is it that the most familiar thing to ourselves be such an enigmatic paradox. There will be many more years until we finally discover the true potential and solve the human body puzzle or we may never be able to. Regardless, Bill Bryson tried to explain this wonder in a simple and interesting way. Great book."

233,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4049388-anna,Rating 5 out of 5,"Writing a popular science book that's understandable and fun for the lay(wo)man is one thing, but to make it fun and worth listening to for someone who does know the minutia of the topic is another. I've spent a lot of time and money learning and forgetting about the intricacies of the human body: sitting through hours of lectures; poring over pages of facts, figures, diagrams; and seeing it off the page as well. For me, this book could have ended up being a more watered down slightly less pedantic review book - and that would have probably bored me to death. However, The Body: A Guide for Occupants isn't written by someone trying to teach ""plebes"" about their field, it isn't written by a science writer at all. Bill MoFo Bryson is the author of this book, and if anyone could find a way to make something interesting to everyone regardless of background, it's him. I may be biased, several of Bill Bryson's books rank among my favorite books of all time (A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail, and I'm a Stranger Here Myself: Notes on Returning to America After Twenty Years Away in particular) so perhaps I'm just predisposed to liking the work he puts out. While there is a very basic rundown of the different parts of the body, their functions, and other related topics (conversations on public health, microbiology, epidemiology, etc...) there's also a lot of trivia, history, anecdotes that help everyone understand that we really know very little about the human body - but we worked hard to get there.The book is written in Bryson's characteristic fun and light manner, but it's full of information presented in a way that makes it feel that he's just as overjoyed to learn about each tidbit as you should be reading it. It's joyful education, even more so when listening to the audiobook which he reads. Listening to an emotive person joyfully explaining the different parts and functions of the brain is a completely different experience from listening to a droning soporific professor. I can't really speak for how info-dumpy it may be, a lot of it is just refreshing my memory of things I know followed by interesting bits of trivia or history that I either didn't remember or didn't learn. Honestly, the non-science parts were more interesting to me because it's fascinating to see what parts of history gets left behind. There's a lot of backstabbing in the research and academic world, that's for sure.I do wonder if he wishes that the book was released next year, because while his chapter on the pandemic that would bring our society to it's knees was pretty spot on, it would have definitely been different knowing what we know now. Though all the experts he interviewed were pretty accurate on the characteristics of a virus that could cause a pandemic, and how unprepared the world would be for it. People keep asking the question ""who could have known?!"", well, apparently a lot of people - enough that Bill Bryson has a whole chapter on it before the pandemic started.This is a fun book, and well narrated by Bryson. This is the perfect light but informative non-fiction book to listen to while walking the dog."

Българското издание допринася още повече за това усещане - голям формат, твърди масивни корици и хубави плътни страници. Последните 20 страници са пълни с източници, така че дори само това трябва да ви е достатъчно, че да вземете ""Тялото"" на сериозно. Получих книгата като подарък за миналата Коледа и ми отне цяла година да я прочета. Не искам да си представям колко време е прекарал Бил Брайсън в написването ѝ. Но пък напълно си е заслужавало!Факт е, че 400 страници са крайно недостатъчни, за да се разгледа тялото в цялата му същност, но пък се оказва, че те са съвсем подходящ размер, за да се положи основата за неговото изучаване. В книгата ще намерите по една глава з�� всяка система в човешкото тяло и ще научите най-важното за нея. В допълнение има много интересни и любопитни факти, както и историята на не един учен или лекар, спомогнали за това да достигнем до днешните ни медицински познания. За по-запознатите от вас, вероятно голяма част от информацията в ""Тялото"" няма да е нова, но пък си мисля, че повечето хора не познават собствените си тела чак толкова добре, че да намерят книгата за ненужна. Тя е от онези четива, към които ще може да се допитвате с години напред или ако не друго, то поне да си припомняте това-онова. Най-хуабвото в нея обаче е, че е написана на много достъпен и лесно разбираем език, а личните истории, разказани вътре, са много увлекателни и остават своя ярък отпечатък. Друг огромен плюс е, че авторът не се страхува да каже, че учените все още нямат отговор на много въпроси, както и да покаже тъмната страна на науката и нейните грешки през годината. Да, това може би не е най-полезният подход по време на световна пандемия, но в крайна сметка е важно да знаем истината за миналото и да се учим от него, вместо да се преструваме, че такива неща не са се случвали. Четейки, човек започва лека-полека да изпитва страхопочитание към собственото си тяло. От една страна неговите сложни, но изключително стиковани процеси са изумителни. Невероятно е как нещо подобно може да съществува и да се развива съвсем само. Невероятно е и колко рядко всъщност дава на късо. В този ред на мисли, ако сте по-параноични или си падате малко хипохондрици, може би е по-добре да не четете ""Тялото"" - знанието колко много неща могат да се объркат във всеки един момент ще ви побърка.За единствен недостатък на книгата бих посочила липсата на изображения. Като човек, който запомня най-лесно чрез образи, картинки и графики, усетих тяхното отсъствие още в самото начало. Дори си позволих да нарисувам по нещо в празните пространства около текста в името на това да разбера написаното по-добре. Сигурна съм, че цветните изображения биха вдигнали себестойността на книгата, но все пак щеше да си заслужава и да я направи още по-ценна."

These, and many more fun body and medical facts, can be yours in this travelogue-esque exploration of the human body and many of its subsystems. I was not wild about most of the sections of food and metabolism as author Gary Taubes as me thoroughly convinced that 1) the calories-in, calories-out model of metabolism is flawed, and 2) that dietary fats have little to no impact on heart disease. Bryson didn't have enough room to explore this fully, so it made me wonder what else he glossed over or over-simplified in writing this book. Wobbled between 3 and 4 stars. There is some great, enjoyable, interesting, funny stuff in here, but I typically enjoy depth over breadth. Other folks would enjoy this much more than me! "
236,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1766263-jonathan,Rating 4 out of 5,"Bill Bryson has made quite the career out of funny, informative, light reading books and *The Body* is no exception. Each chapter covers some portion of the human body, like discussions about blood, brain, nerves, sex organs, death and cancer. Here are a few tidbits of info for your perusal:+ If you blew [a virus] up to the size of a tennis ball, a human would be five hundred miles high. A bacterium on the same scale would be about the size of a beach ball.+ researchers infected the metal door handle to an office building and found it took only about four hours for the “virus” to spread through the entire building, infecting over half of employees and turning up on virtually every shared device like photocopiers and coffee machines.+ Giraffes, oddly, sometimes have gallbladders and sometimes don’t.+ To power our forward motion, we have a distinctively gigantic muscle in our buttocks, the gluteus maximus, and an Achilles tendon, something no ape has.+ If you are deprived of it for long enough, you will die—though what exactly it is that kills you from lack of sleep is a mystery, too.+ The prostate, it might be said, produces seminal fluid throughout a man’s adulthood and anxiety in his later years.+ It has been suggested, in fact, that if all men lived long enough, they would all get prostate cancer.+ That’s why you are constantly told to eat more fiber: because it keeps your gut microbes happy and at the same time, for reasons not well understood, reduces the risk of heart disease, diabetes, bowel cancer, and indeed death of all types.But the most amazing one to me was in the chapter on the brain. In discussing how long it takes an image to get from your eye to the brain (about a fifth of a second) :+ To help us deal better with this fractional lag, the brain does a truly extraordinary thing: it continuously forecasts what the world will be like a fifth of a second from now, and that is what it gives us as the present.Mind blowing. It was also amazing just how little we still know about the body, especially the ""Whys"". My wife is probably glad I am finally finished reading the book so I will stop interrupting her reading by narrating another wild fact from the book!My two biggest take aways from the book are that while there are indeed plenty of disagreements about what we need and don't need, the scientific community is solidly behind the need for both exercise and, believe it or not, fiber. Exercise continually showed up in the book, as it reduces the odds of everything from cancer to Alzheimer's. And while there might be some disagreement on how much of both exercise and fiber, both are essential to a healthy life. As one of fibers biggest boosters (again, much to my wife's chagrin), I felt vindicated!So while this isn't any kind of text book, it sure is an informative and interesting read. You will learn a lot of things you just didn't know before. And he also name drops a lot of other books for more in depth study, which I have added to my Want To Read list, like Clean: The New Science of Skin and the Beauty of Doing Less, Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex and Microcosm: E. Coli and the New Science of Life. Gotta get to reading!"

Every chapter I learned something new and unexpected like how the brain can hold as much information as the entire digital library or how the entire global supply of penicillin to this day originates from bacteria found on a single cantaloupe from the middle of America. From a body mechanics standpoint, it is amazing how the body has adapted to be incredibly efficient at what it does. Compared to machine design, the body is operating with a hammer and chisel at times yet blows anything human design can achieve out of the water. It is crazy how far our knowledge of the body has progressed since the seemingly ridiculous experiments that earlier generations carried out. It is also crazy how little our knowledge of the body has progressed since the seemingly ridiculous experiments that earlier generations carried out. The last few chapters are difficult to get through as they deal with disease, death, how terrible health care can be, but gave me so much respect for life and the amazing obstacles that our bodies overcome behind the scenes. This book has most definitely made me a more informed occupant of the body. "

Costa Ricans have only about one-fifth the personal wealth of Americans, and have poorer health care, but live longer. Moreover, people in one of the poorest regions of Costa Rica, the Nicoya Peninsula, live longest of all, even though they have much higher rates of obesity and hypertension. The also have longer telomeres.The theory is that they benefit from closer social bonds and family relationships. Curiously, it was found that if they live alone or don't see a child at least one a week, the telomere length advantage vanishes. It is an extraordinary fact that having good and loving relationships physically alters your DNA. Conversely, a 2010 study found, not having such relationships doubles your risk of dying from any cause.I bought a hard copy for reference, but listened to Bryson read this audio version."

Lots of factoids about the various parts of the human body, combined with historical anecdote, done in Bryson style.There are a few dabs of cognitive dissonance scattered through the book, as expected from anything to do with medicine or physiology. More than once my bullshit meter gave a twitch. But in general it was a great read.I noted that although the chapter on pain includes a little missive on opioids, but the chapter on blood chemistry doesn’t have an equivalent criticism of statins.The section on infectious diseases was particularly interesting and ironic, given that this book was published in 2019.And by the way, my edition was an audiobook, read by the author himself. The very last line was certainly worth waiting for."
240,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3727861-andrea,No Rating,"Bryson's an accomplished storyteller, and so can make entertaining a survey of parts of the human body, and the progress of medical science toward vaguely understanding them.I won't rate it on the science, since it's been a while since I made any study of it. It's interesting how facts morph and accepted truths change. MSG, for instance, has never been proven to be bad for anyone (at normal rates of consumption), but I still see proud 'no MSG' labels on food.And nothing could be better as a negative advertisement for time travel (to the past) than a description of a breast cancer operation pre the use the anaesthetic.Also notable that this was published a few years before the COVID-19 pandemic, and it's eerie listening to the discourse on successful diseases being the ones with the less formidible mortality rates, since the scarier the disease is, the more seriously people will treat it, and the harder it is to spread."

God is to be praised for this.3. The author describes the hundreds of thousands of dangers out there to the human body stating that it is a miracle that we haven’t been affected by them. I see the providential hand as the cause of this miracle protecting us. What a comfort to know that none of these potential dangers has the potential to harm human bodies by chance. 4.

As he described our amazing bodies, I couldn’t help but think how intricately and wonderfully we are designed. This book is full of useful-only-on-Jeopardy!-truly-mind-blowing facts (The length of one person’s blood vessels would wrap around Earth 2.5 times!) I think this book could be summarized by saying: Our bodies are unbelievable, and humans know way less about them than we’d like to admit. Unsurprisingly there’s a fair amount of talk of evolution, and some disappointing views about the economic cost of taking care of the elderly, but this book is still very much worth the read for the sheer awe it inspires."
243,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23918401-jon-koebrick,Rating 4 out of 5,Bill Bryson is one of the best nonfiction writers I have encountered. His language is incredibly crisp and the research he employs must be staggering. Bryson deftly devours a massive quantity of information and reports it in a way that demonstrates comprehension filled with dry humor and interesting little facts that pique the mind. The Body is an excellent book and one I would recommend to those with any sort of inquiring mind and even for those who seldom read nonfiction. This is a book you could easily work on over a longer time and pick it up to read after long intervals without losing reading steam.

Scary stuff.If you lean towards hypochondria, don’t read this.

The author focuses on anecdotes from the history of medicine and biology as much as he tries to avoid going into technical depth. It also feels like the author is talking to an average white, male, young, American throughout the book; a global perspective on health is lacking. Would not recommend this book to other readers.

It is a serious book that is packed with information, much of it highly scientific, but it is always readable and understandable. And here's the secret sauce that makes it so much fun to read: It is often irreverent, frequently hilarious, and repeatedly snarky. Translation: It's fun to read!Prodigiously researched and written by travel writer Bill Bryson, this is a deep dive for laypeople (no medical degree needed) into mysteries of the human body from head to toe. This is a book about you! Chapters cover everything from the brain to the guts to the nerves. You'll learn not only how our various pieces and parts work, but also what happens when things go wrong. But it's not just boring fact after boring fact after boring fact. For example, in the chapter on skin, the body's largest organ, you'll find out such fascinating revelations as:• When you touch something, your brain not only tells you *how* something feels, but also how it *ought* to feel, which is why a lover's caress induces a sigh and the same touch by a creepy stranger could make you shudder.• Sweating is activated by the release of adrenaline, which is why you break into a sweat when you're stressed.Oh, and the very accurate biological description of sperm in chapter 18, ""In the Beginning: Conception and Birth"" is so funny I laughed out loud. Meanwhile, other parts are only for the strong of stomach, such as the description of what is likely the most extraordinary story on record of appendectomy survival and a recounting by the patient herself in a letter to her sister of the first mastectomy, performed in 1810 without anesthesia.Why read a book about your body? Not only is it interesting to learn what makes us tick, as well as sick, but also it could help you to live a healthier and longer life. Understanding how your body works can make you appreciate and care for it better instead of taking it for granted.It's not often that a nonfiction book can be described as witty, amusing, and highly entertaining, but that's exactly what this is."

269,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43477226-todd-stockslager,Rating 4 out of 5,"Review title: Be glad you're aliveBruce Springsteen is indeed right: it ain't no sin to be glad you're alive, an emotion you'll feel after reading about the body through Bill Bryson's pen. It's a marvelous machine--no, far better actually, Bryson realizes and writes: no machine made by man has yet had (and likely never will) the complexity, strength, flexibility, endurance, and intelligence of the human body. It's a good place to live. Bryson has written about pretty much everything from hiking the Appalachian Trail to living in England to--well, everything (A Short History of Everything was the first of his books I read), always with a sense of humor and curiosity about the world around him. He is an American transplant to the UK where he met his wife and they have spent most of their married years, but he retains an American view of the world (yes there is one, identifiable by passers-by on the street even without hearing the accent, a British coworker and friend assures me) and the body even as he interviews experts and includes examples from both countries. As Bryson tours around and through the body chapter by chapter it is astonishing how much is unique about humans from other members of the animal kingdom, how intricately things fit together and work in the only way they possibly could, and how little we know about how and why the body and its parts work. Bryson describes these intricate mechanics, chemistry, and physics as the end result of genetic mutation or environmental adaptation and often gently deflects away theories of intelligent design, even when the statistical probability of evolution approaches impossibly small numbers. This isn't a medical textbook or how-to guide to personal health and body maintenance. It is just a fun exercise in curiosity about the shell our minds, souls, and lives occupy, and the scientists and medical doctors and experimenters who have poked and prodded it through the centuries. The usual suspects are in play (da Vinci, Harvey, Salk) but leave it to Bryson to highlight the often oddball men and women who haven't been given the credit they deserve. It is astonishing how little was known two centuries ago, last century, even last decade and how wrong prevailing theories and treatments were then; it raises the question of how astonishing current medical practices will appear to our grandchildren just a few decades hence. It was also written and published before the corona virus pandemic exploded, so it does not specifically address the virus, although he does write about why pharmaceutical companies are investing less and less time and money in research and development of drugs to treat these new environmental risks; as a consequence, Bryson concludes prophetically, ""In the event of a really catastrophic epidemic--one that killed children or young adults in large numbers, say--Kinch believes we wouldn't be able to produce vaccine fast enough to treat everyone, even if the vaccine was effective."" (p. 334) Of course, any medical cure is far from a sure thing. Bryson notes how while we are by far healthier globally on average due to the defeat of major infectious diseases--tuberculosis, pneumonia, and most influenzas--by a small set of treatments, more people now face health risks from lifestyle choices. Indeed, the average American life span suffers in comparison to the citizens of most modern advanced economies, despite spending far more per capita on health care than other nations. We're overstuffed (eating 20% more calories per day on average than citizens of healthier European countries, Bryson says), oversedentary due to desk jobs and television obsessions, and oversedated on medications that have marginal benefits or lead to prescription drug dependency. This is still the best time to be alive for every human in every country, and America is still a great country with great doctors and nurses, but pushing away from the pizza, putting down the remote, and considering improvements to the economic and political climate of health care could benefit every body.It's no sin to be glad you're alive in the body you've been given. Enjoy it with the curiosity and the attention it deserves courtesy of Bryson. "

271,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17056482-arathi-mohan,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Body by Bill BrysonI picked up this book because the cover intrigued me. That...and the title of course. ""The Body - a guide for occupants"" - now if that isn't a simple yet clever title guaranteed to increase readership, I don't know what is. Because all of us are, for this life atleast, trapped in the limited yet wonderful physical entity called The Body. So as long as we are occupying The Body, why not read a guide that will help us understand our bodies a little better? Life is nothing short of a miracle. And for human life to have evolved to the current form from having started off as single-celled organisms is pretty remarkable. The Body is composed of different organ systems working in symphony powered by this 'invisible' energy called Life. The author neatly delves into different parts of The Human Body - with dedicated chapters for the organ systems (like respiratory, nervous, circulatory, among others). You also get to hear interesting anecdotes on major and minor scientific discoveries and he also shines a light on some lesser known heroes and heroines in the scientific field who did not get due credit for their contributions. There are many moments in this book that will fill you with awe and wonder. They may just make you appreciate your bodies a little more as it quietly goes about its business day in day out keeping you alive and active. That is - until disease or illness strikes. There are chapters that discuss what happens when things go wrong (disease) and very wrong (cancer). The book ends on a sobering note with a reminder of the eternal truth - death. Because that is going to happen one day. It is the journey between birth and death that our bodies help us traverse..and it's important to keep it primed up with good food, regular exercise and restful sleep."
272,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1509971-matt,Rating 4 out of 5,"In the same vein as ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"", Bryson tackles his next ambitious subject, the human body. Once again, he does an excellent job of taking complex systems and ideas, and bringing them down to our level. I found this book truly fascinating,... and also a little gross at times. Some of the details he shared hit a little too close to home.Here is a sample of some things that I found really interesting: - The outer layer of your skin is almost entirely dead cells. So when you look at a person, what you are seeing is mostly cadaver. - When you sunburn, your skin turns red because your blood vessels are swelling up. That is also why you feel hot to the touch. - Your body produces 5-10 ounces of tears every day. That's almost a full can of soda. - If everyone in the world were as overweight as Americans, it would be the equivalent of adding 1 billion people to the planet. - Food stays in your body for about 55 hours if you are a grown man. It's about 72 hours if you are a grown woman. - Poop is primarily brown because of expired red blood cells. - Gravity affects us differently based on our mass. So, a child half your height only experiences 1/132nd of the force of gravity when falling. This is why kids seem so indestructible. Just like he did in ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"", Bryson doesn't hesitate to say how much we still don't know about the human body. For example, modern opinion is that man is the result of millions of years of trial and error, where our most useful characteristics were passed on through survival of the fittest. But this doesn't explain why we have eyebrows. As far as we can tell, they serve no real evolutionary purpose, but they are very useful for self-expression. Also, we are the only species who experiences emotional crying. No one has a really good evolutionary explanation for why we do this. Bryson repeated over and over, ""the purpose of X is unknown"", or ""nobody knows why X happens"". Several times he described an attribute of the human body and then said that it was ""one of life's many imponderables"". There is no denying that we know far more than we did 100 years ago, but I'm sure the same will be said of us 100 years from now. Of course, any book exploring the science of the human body is going to end by talking about death. I learned that heart disease is the number one cause of death in America and kills more people than cancer, influenza, pneumonia, and accidents combined. We hear so much about cancer and are often worried about getting it (rightly so), but in reality we should be worried about taking better care of our hearts. One in three Americans dies of heart disease. Bryson also shared this little nugget: the average body in a sealed coffin takes between 5 and 40 years to decompose. Lovely thought. Bryson ended the book with a great line. After talking about burial and cremation, he abruptly says ""And that's you gone. But was fun while it lasted."" It was just a funny way to end, and it fit perfectly with his quippy sense of humor. Excellent book, and highly recommended. "

The lethal surgical procedures of yesteryear have been replaced by the unnecessary over-medications today. Even safe surgical procedures today need to be evaluated on an excel sheet for true life-quality gain vs cost vs percent effectiveness.Five pages from the end of the book, this statement captures what we 'know' quite well:Some people live longer than they out to by any known measures. Costa Ricans have only about one-fifth the personal wealth of Americans, and have poorer health care, but live longer. Moreover, people in one of the poorest regions of Costa Rica, the Nicoya Peninsula, live longest of all, even though they have much higher rates of obesity and hypertension. The also have longer telomeres. The theory is that they benefit from closer social bonds and family relationships. Curiously, it was found that if they live alone or don't see a child at least one a week, the telomere length advantage vanishes. It is an extraordinary fact that having good and loving relationships physically alters your DNA. Conversely, a 2010 study found, not having such relationships doubles your risk of dying from any cause.This book reminded me of We Have No Idea: A Guide to the Unknown Universe. Both books go into depths about the latest knowledge in their fields (Astrophysics, and the Human Body). We think these scientists know SO MUCH. But you come away from both books realizing that we are no where close to having these fields REALLY figured out.

The reason we haven't had another experience like that isn't because we have been especially vigilant. It's because we have been lucky.""I listened to the Audio Book read by the author.

Met een bang hart want ik lees zelden tot nooit non-fictie. Met andere woorden, dit was een uitdaging voor mij.“Het lichaam, een reisgids” gaat simpelweg over het lichaam. Over alle aspecten ervan en zeer veel leuke weetjes. Wist je trouwens dat je 50 à 100 haren per dag verliest? En dat je je 30 tot 40 keer omdraait of van houding verandert in je slaap?Het was een zeer interessant boek, alles wat ik in mijn eerste jaar Ergotherapie gezien heb qua het lichaam, kwam hier aan bod en dit was een leuke opfrisser. Hoewel dit boek voor mij een jaar eerder er mocht zijn, de manier waarop alles wordt uitgelegd was zeer aangenaam. Dit zou me zeker geholpen hebben tijdens het studeren.Desondanks ik wat voorkennis had, is dit toch een toegankelijk boek om te lezen, ook al weet je niet veel over het lichaam. Ik geef toe, niet elke Latijnse term kende ik, maar het opzoeken ervan was ook niet zo hard nodig. De context legde het woord wel uit.Wat dit boek ook zo leuk maakt is de humor van Bryson. Alles wordt op een leuke manier uitgelegd en zijn humor dat af en toe boven komt, maakt dat ik toch wel genoten heb om dit te lezen.Het spijtige aan dit boek is dat het soms zijn focus verliest. Er zit bijvoorbeeld een hoofdstuk in over het evenwicht maar het gaat dan over koorts terwijl ik niet direct een verband tussen de twee zag, nog steeds niet eigenlijk. Het was fijner geweest als de focus van het hoofdstuk behouden werd, hierdoor had ik soms het gevoel dat de auteur van de hak op de tak wou springen.In de meeste hoofdstukken komen er ook pathologieën aan bod. Hier heb ik een opmerkelijk iets gevonden. Namelijk: het hoofd. In dit hoofdstuk werden de zintuigen besproken en werd er vermeld welke pathologie je kan hebben (natuurlijk niet allemaal) als je geur of zicht niet normaal werken. Dit vond ik zeer interessant, daar niet van, maar ik vind het enorm spijtig dat er bij het gehoord niets vermeld was over slechthorendheid of doofheid. Enkel dat als je trilharen vernietigd zijn, die niet terug groeien. Benoem het gewoon, het is niet erg hoor. Dit viel mij gewoon op. Maar goed, dit is een beetje te vergaand.Dit is mijn eerste non-fictie boek in jaren dat ik vrijwillig lees (lees: geen schoolboek) en heb er ontzettend van genoten. Het leest zeker trager dan een gewoon fictief boek, maar ik heb zeker veel geleerd van dit boek. Bryson is een goede auteur omdat hij alles zo luchtig maar tegelijk serieus kan brengen, met een gezonde portie humor. 4 van 5 sterren geef ik dit boek.En vergeet niet, je lichaam is en blijft een mysterie!Dit boek mocht ik lezen voor De club van echte lezers. Hiervoor dank dat ik een exemplaar mocht ontvangen van hen en Atlas Contact. Dit beïnvloedt mijn mening niet."
275,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Interesting and informative and a very enjoyable read. Bryson brings the subject of the body to life with lots of sad and amazing stories of discoveries and the history of diseases and many other areas. There's also so many stories of people who either didn't get the credit they deserved or it was stolen from them. The part about pathologists risking their own lives to bring more understanding to diseases brought tears to my eyes. I already knew some of the areas covered but hey, what the hell, it's good to be reminded. Bryson is definitely a talented writer and he's brings the subject to life with so many details it's hard to take it all in. This is a book I will be reading again in the future.Read this book"
276,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,Rating 5 out of 5,"Bill Bryson is one of the most widely read and beloved writers on so many subjects, be it travelogues to obscure locations, the history of the universe, and now the most ridiculous subject of them all, your body. Just kidding, not YOUR body, but the human body, and at all times Bryson is an erudite and irreverent guide through this endlessly fascinating subject, right up to the various ways the body expires.For me, the most interesting area discussed was the evolution of our knowledge of nutrition since those of us even just over the age of 30 can remember when nutritional and dietary suggestions were quite different than they are now. Bryson is an effective guide through a lot of the unscientific BS that pervades these discussions and offers an up to date account of proper amounts of exercise and nutritive consumption. He also details where some of these misconceptions may have come from, usually a misreading of a single study that was leaded to the popular media. Bryson is also quite clear where we still have no idea as to why certain things happen, or exist, or how to combat them and this forms at times the most distressing aspect of the work, though obviously necessary. The quick little asides and meanderings on how incredible some aspects of our regular functioning are, make for great reading especially in the chapter on all of the various chemicals your body uses and produces on a regular basis. As I mentioned, Bryson can be irreverent and waggish when discussing certain things and this pervades the chapter on sex. One clean but perfectly expressed point on why we may have evolved to engage in this practice instead of mere cloning by single-sex organisms occurs later in the work:""Sex may dilute our personal contribution to posterity, but it is great for the species. By mixing and matching genes, we get variety and that gives us safety and resilience. It makes it harder for diseases to sweep through whole populations. It also means that we can evolve. We can hold on to beneficial genes and discard ones that impede our collective happiness. Cloning gives you the same thing over and over. Sex gives you Einstein and Rembrandt - and a lot of dorks, too, of course.""Those wanting a more academic appraisal of these areas along with an examination of our evolutionary history should definitely check out Harvard Professor Daniel Lieberman's, ""The Story of the Human Body."" Lieberman is someone, also, that Bryson references heavily throughout the work. However those looking for an up to date appraisal of the human body from a masterful storyteller should also consider this fantastic volume. "

Fiquei desde então com vontade de ler mais da sua obra e aproveitei este lançamento recente para satisfazer esse desejo. Desta vez, Bill Bryson propõe-se percorrer o corpo humano, por todas as suas diversas e variadas partes, e levar o leitor a conhecer mais sobre a forma como funcionamos e o verdadeiro milagre que é a nossa existência. O Corpo – Um Guia para Ocupantes é um livro para curiosos. Em cada capítulo, Bill Bryson ocupa-se de um dos nossos sistemas ou órgãos, fala um pouco sobre a história da evolução do conhecimento sobre o mesmo, enquanto vai apresentando exemplos e factos pouco conhecidos sobre o tema em causa. Isto faz com que a leitura nunca se torne enfadonha, apesar de alguns termos técnicos desconhecidos do comum dos mortais. O autor volta aqui a conseguir um excelente equilíbrio entre factos e a componente de entretenimento, de tal forma que chega a parecer que é simples fazê-lo.Li este livro antes de termos entrado todos em quarentena, mas quando a COVID-19 já era uma realidade bem presente. No 
Capítulo 20 – Quando as Coisas Correm Mal: Doenças
 , Bill Bryson fala sobre epidemias passadas e refere (pág. 397): “ Uma doença pode ou não tornar-se uma epidemia, e isso depende de quatro fatores: o quão letal é, a sua capacidade de encontrar novas vítimas, a facilidade ou dificuldade de a conter e a suscetibilidade a vacinas. […] Um vírus bem sucedido é aquele que não mata demasiado bem e consegue circular com um grande raio de alcance “. Mais à frente, falando sobre o ébola (pág. 398): “ Em várias ocasiões, graças a viagens aéreas, conseguiu escapar para outros países, mas felizmente foi contido em todos esses casos. É possível que não tenhamos sempre tanta sorte. […] É espantoso, na verdade, que não aconteçam coisas más com maior frequência. Segundo uma estimativa mencionada por Ed Yong no Atlantic, o número de vírus em aves e mamíferos com potencial para atravessar a barreira das espécies e infetar os humanos pode ser na ordem dos 800.000. É muito perigo potencial. “.Sinto-me sempre mais rica quando leio os livros deste autor, e esta leitura reforçou o quanto gosto de não ficção. Bill Bryson escreve livros informativos, que se lêem quase como ficção pela fluidez e humor que neles inclui, sem nunca descurar o seu verdadeiro objetivo que é aumentar o conhecimento do leitor sobre o que o rodeia – ou, neste caso, sobre o que tem dentro de si. Gostei muito e recomendo."
279,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3570671-john-braine,Rating 4 out of 5,"Does what it says on the tin. And reads exactly as you would expect from Bryson: well written, well researched, informative, revealing and entertaining. One factor that stood out for me was the sheer number of times that a scientific or medical theory took flight, was seized upon by the media, and stuck as a firmly believed fact despite subsequent research that proves the theory to have no scientific basis or 100% proven to be wrong. It's quite scary how much this happens. But because whole industries emerge to capitalise on what are ultimately urban legends, they are incredibly hard to quash. This book might as easily been titled Health, and there is unavoidable overlap in the subject matter, but it seemed the second half of the book was primarily focused on health and disease. And this is where a small but disappointing element here poked its head out. Although still a bit niche/controversial there's a steadily growing acceptance by medical professionals, that psychogenic disease is a grossly underestimated factor in our health, particularly in the area of chronic pain. The chapter on chronic pain was either disappointingly researched or deliberately ignored, despite evidence that would be hard to miss if investigating this area, so I suspect the latter. There were many points in the book, where the evidence was right there in his own words, yet he chose not to acknowledge it. There was even a chapter about Akureyri disease, which broke out in Iceland in the 1940s where no physical factors could be found and scientists concluded its genesis as psychogenic ""which means"" Bryson says ""they had no idea whatsoever what caused it"". It absolutely doesn't mean that Bill! It means it was psychogenic! I love Bryson but that is one of the most ignorant or deliberately obtuse lines I've ever read. A small factor overall. But it left a bad taste.To end on a better note, I actually wailed ""Oh no"" when I realised Bryson was narrating his own book. He does not have a good track record, whereas his regular narrator William Roberts does an amazing job of capturing the personality in his writing, an endeavour the author has failed to do in previous recordings. However, I think he's had some coaching, as he was a lot more engaging than past narrations. "
280,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4710528-gavin,Rating 4 out of 5,"Bryson had so much medical information to share in this book that there was almost no room for his signature wit! He managed to squeeze in just enough humorous turns of phrase that it was recognizable as Bryson. Man did I learn so much, reading whole passages aloud to my wife, an ER nurse, who would raise her eyebrows in surprise that the average person doesn't know what RH factor is, or what organ the appendix protrudes off of, or how miraculous insulin is. There were fewer supporting anecdotes than expected, but the facts and cases Bryson imparted were super ""sticky"" – they'll stay with me for a while. He knows exactly how long to write about a subject, in crystal clear and agreeable sentences, before moving on. A solid read.""The body is often likened to a machine, but it is so much more than that. It works twenty-four hours a day for decades without (for the most part) needing regular servicing or the installation of spare parts, runs on water and a few organic compounds, is soft and rather lovely, is accommodatingly mobile and pliant, reproduces itself with enthusiasm, makes jokes, feels affection, appreciates a red sunset and a cooling breeze.... And how do we celebrate the glory of our existence? Well, for most of us by eating maximally and exercising minimally. Think of all the junk you throw down your throat and how much of your life is spent sprawled in a near-vegetative state in front of a glowing screen. Yet in some kind and miraculous way our bodies look after us, extract nutrients from the miscellaneous foodstuffs we push into our faces, and somehow hold us together, generally at a pretty high level, for decades. Suicide by lifestyle takes ages."""

Human biology, physiology and anatomy for the layman for which only Bill Bryson in his inimitable way could make this subject so readable. As someone in my mid-seventies having to visit doctors more frequently, it was time to learn why my body is causing issues and just how modern medicine could help, this was a must read book. The book is divided into 23 chapters dealing with different functions of the body. You could read by choosing any chapter or subject of interest. However, I recommend starting at least with the first three. Bryson says, ""The brain is you. Everything else is plumbing and scaffolding"". As he takes us on a tour of the body there are plenty of medical anecdotes, fun facts and interesting trivia. Plus, a plethora of diseases to think about. The author points out how medical science has evolved, the mistakes made in the past and how much we still don't know. Bryson often speaks of evolution to explain the many complex functions of the body and how we differ from other mammals, such as how we fell out of trees to become bipedal. That's ok, but others could likely see the marvelous laws of nature set up not by accident but by an intelligent creation, even over millions of years.The only other book I have read by this author is his popular and lighthearted, "" A walk in the woods"". Made into a delightful movie of the same title starring Robert Redford and Nick Nolte in 2015."
282,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27986103-mike,Rating 5 out of 5,"How can you not like this? It's another of Bryson's fact and trivia books, this time covering the body from top to toe - in a sense - and uncovering all manner of interesting information about how the body ticks, and about the people who made the discoveries. And how there's still a great deal we just don't know about the body, even though you'd think we were up with the play completely by now. As always the anecdotal material is fascinating: the scientists who literally killed themselves in various ways to make discoveries - or unwittingly killed themselves while making discoveries. The scientists who didn't discover something new but claimed they did, and caused the real discoverer to be cast in the background. The scientists who did all manner of appalling things to themselves and others in order to learn about how our bodies work, and the men and women who healed others by trying something different instead of something that killed as many as it cured. It can be almost overwhelming, but you read on, because after all, who isn't interested in their own body and what's going on inside it?"

Ich dachte sogar daran abzubrechen, weil ich einfach nicht noch mehr zahlen hören/lesen wollte. Zahlen die man sich nicht merken kann und die unablässig auf mich eingeprasselt sind… und dabei hatte ich mich so auf das Buch gefreut. Dann plötzlich stellte ich fest, wie viel von dem was Bryson sagte in meinem Kopf hängen geblieben ist. Nach und nach kamen mir diese kleinen Geschichten und Fakten wieder in den Sinn. Und das Buch fing echt an mir Spass zu machen.Bryson gibt hier einen echten, umfangreichen und spannenden Überblick über den ganzen Körper, vom Scheitel bis zur Sohle. So viele Dinge die ich noch nicht wusste und so viele Dinge, die die Medizin noch gar nicht weiss! 😲 Für jeden der gerne den Klugscheisser auf einer Party markiert, ist das Buch genau richtig! Ich habe eine gute Allgemeinbildung, freue mich aber immer etwas Neues dazu zu lernen und dafür ist dieses Buch grandios, auch wenn man die Zahlen nur am Rande mitbekommt und diese auch kaum speichert: Eine absolute Empfehlung, auch für „Nicht-Medizin-Studenten“… 😉😁👍🏻"

In the past, I’ve found them entertaining if lacking depth and being a bit insensitive, the last of which I attributed to decades since publication. After reading this book, I must revise my opinion on this last point.This book was published in 2019. A scientist shouldn’t be described as “exotic” because they hold multiple nationalities. The subtle undertones upholding male superiority are not appreciated, not to mention the blatant anti-transgender language in the chromosome section. The sharp language of describing those who die by suicide as “killing themselves” and the multiple suicide tips are extremely damaging and frankly unnecessary. If all of this isn’t enough, the writing is straight up lazy - he copy pasted the same sentence into multiple chapters, and I even recognized some sentences from previous books. Perhaps I’m being sensitive, but it took away from the actual content for me. The book is well-researched, but nothing else about it sits comfortably with me."

286,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29221912-zainab-alqassab,Rating 5 out of 5,"Terrific Read !! Simple, easy and entertaining. Reading this book was really like reading a novel. I liked author style, he got a way with words and good sense of humor. The book is divided into 21 chapters. Starting with building humans 🧬 and ending with death 💀. In between, author tackles one of the body system in each chapter, related topics to the body (sleep, pain) and diseases. The most interesting thing about this book is that he’s linking every system or part of the body with the history of medicine, history of diseases and fascinating stories about scientists and their discoveries.As the book is popular science, it is definitely not written for medical professionals or academics. It’s not that shallow nor that deep, both professionals and laypersons could enjoy such a read. The content Seems more like basic knowledge and good for students i would recommend +11 to read. You can also check out this documentary on Netflix: “HUMAN: THE WORLS WITHIN”. Same content as the book(more or less). "
287,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4384677-homerun2,Rating 4 out of 5,"Bryson is always intelligent, quirky, and entertaining and The Body is all of that. He takes often dry factual material and enlivens it. The organization of the book, by body sections and systems, is clear. His interjection of strange stories about the personalities and lives of some significant medical researchers adds to the fun.The very last chapters are somewhat different. Instead of describing physiological facts, he begins talking about the health care systems in different countries. He compares death rates, death causes, number of tests run, and of course, cost. Some might find this off-putting but it seemed to me to be germane when talking about the body. He ends naturally enough by talking about dying and again discusses different death experiences according to various factors. All in all, a book that informs but holds your attention and encourages pondering. Thanks to the publisher and to Net Galley for providing me with an ARC in exchange for my honest review."
288,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is another highly entertaining book by Bill Bryson. I'll happily read anything he ever writes on any subject whatsoever. In The Body he takes on the wonderful and complex thing that is the human body he makes it comprehensible to the reader. He does this with humor and an eye for fascinating details. Along the way he tells the stories of the scientific heroes who have made important discoveries about how the human body works, and he gives them the praise (and occasional censure) that they deserve. Bryson simply does not know how to be boring and this book is enjoyable from beginning to end. I, on the other hand, DO know how to be boring, and I've been boring my family with facts about the human body for the past few days. They are going to be relieved that I'm finally done with this book."
289,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/77697536-mary-norfleet,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is one of the most interesting and fascinating books I have ever read. It is also at times horrifying, especially when the chapters talk about research, pharmaceuticals and medical tests. I wasn't going to read it when I first heard of it because I thought it would be too ""scientific"" and hard to read. Having read most all of Bill Bryson's books, I should have known better. It is easy to understand and sprinkled with his own brand of laugh out loud funny asides. The amount of research that goes into any excellent non-fiction book is always amazing to me. Besides Bryson, I enjoy any non-fiction by Erik Larson, Simon Winchester and David McCullough. If you like to learn while reading an enjoyable ""story"", I high recommend all these authors. That said, Bill Bryon's ""The Body"" is one of the very best!"

We all are capable of some degree of ingratitude for the complicatedness that we embody, literally, within us.The smallest bones in your body can be found in your ears, and they're so tiny that can be quite easily be placed on a shirt button. A functioning human heart when plucked out and severed can gush out blood that would spray for 3 meters in distance. Our part of the eyes that the world gets to see is the only 1/6th of the whole thing. That's eerily mighty. The book is generously peppered with trivia like these.But also some humbling trivia too. Your body when cremated results in ashes that weigh around 2 kilograms. That's how inconsequential we are, yet we embody something incomprehensibly stunning too. My highest possible recommendation."

This is the first book I've read by Bill Bryson and it won't be the last! He does an amazing job and providing a lot of information in a clear and interesting way. One warning though....there are parts, that while super interesting, are also uncomfortable to listen to. It contains frightening info about antibiotics resistance, gruesome historical medical treatments and cringeworthy ways people have died or failed to die when it seems like they should have. Also, take a walk and eat a vegetable. It is amazing how much your body depends on you moving around a little and eating reasonably. "

I was so looking forward to reading this one, as I read and loved all of Bryson's books up till now. However, this one doesn't feel like a Bill Bryson book at all. It's very dry, there's none of Bryson's wonderful humor in it, as there was in his ""History of Everything,"" a superb scientific read. There are some sort of nasty, or at least snarky comments here and there, and as others here have mentioned, unbased conclusions which seem to be based on the author's views. I identify with his views, but would like my popular science books to prove things to me based on scientific knowledge and not opinion. Not sure what happened here but I don't have to continue reading this. "

I remember taking a human biology course in my very first semester in college about 45 years ago and just being blown away by how fascinating everything was. The professor certainly had a lot to do with it – it was obvious to everyone that he just loved the subject he was teaching.Bill Bryson brings that same enthusiasm to this book. I can tell that he is fascinated by exactly the same things that fascinate me – and he writes about them superbly. The book is mostly just a non-stop list of factoids told with a lot of historical context. Some people may not appreciate it as much as I do. But for me it was great reading."

It is entertaining to read while being quite educational and even mesmerizing at times. I would even recommend this read to a doctor, not just a lay person, particularly specialists that don't always look at the whole body in the diagnosis and treatment of disease... a lot of good reminders what and where to look.

Pleasant and entertaining writing from Bryson, but obviously too broad to be at all insightful. My main gripe, and I can’t remember if I noticed this before in his other books, is that at least half the content is historical gossip about the people who discovered things. Even then there’s just not enough time to do them justice, and Bryson comes off as ignorantly judgmental at best (“so and so discovered XYZ but he was a philanderer” etc. - so what?). Learned a some interesting facts (which I’ll likely forget within the next few weeks), and it’s not awful, but I can’t really recommend it."

I would most probably read all the books of Bill Bryson.My detail review only speaks about one thing : “Miles to go before I sleep”Note to self: Keep pondering upon the imponderables.QUESTIONS THAT NEED ATTENTION“Curiously, we don’t have any receptors for wetness. We have only thermal sensors to guide us, which is why when you sit down on a wet spot, you can’t generally tell whether it really is wet or just cold.”why are there no receptors for wetness???“so why have we invested so much energy and risk in producing mental capacity that we don’t really need? That is just one of the many things about your brain that your brain won’t tell you.”“We are the only creatures that cry from feeling, as far as we can tell. Why we do so is another of life’s many mysteries. We get no physiological benefit from erupting in tears. It is also a little odd surely that this act signifying powerful sadness is also triggered by extreme joy or quiet rapture or intense pride or almost any other potent emotional state.”Why do we cry then?“The active ingredient in all chili peppers is a chemical called capsaicin. When you ingest capsaicin, the body releases endorphins—it’s not at all clear why—and that provides us with a literally warm glow of pleasure. As with any warmth, however, it can quickly grow uncomfortable and then intolerable.”Why body releases endorphin when we take chili/capsaicin?“Horrifying as the German experiments were, they were outdone, in scale if not cruelty, by the Japanese. Under a doctor named Shiro Ishii, the Japanese built an enormous complex of more than 150 buildings spread over almost 1,500 acres at Harbin in Manchuria with the avowed purpose of determining human physiological limitations through any means necessary. The facility was known as Unit 731”.Need to know more about Unit 731“The number of spermatozoa produced by the average man in the prime of life varies from 1 million to 120 million per milliliter, with an average of about 25 million per milliliter. The average ejaculation is about three milliliters, which means that a typical sex act produces enough sperm to repopulate a medium-sized country at the very least. Why there is such a broad range of wriggling potentiality, and indeed why such an extravagance of production even at the lower end when only one sperm is required for conception, are questions that science has yet to answer.”why the wastage then??“A twenty-week-old fetus will weigh no more than three or four ounces but will already have 6 million eggs inside her. That number falls to 1 million by the time of birth and continues to fall, though at a slower rate, through life. As she enters her childbearing years, a woman will have about 180,000 eggs primed and ready to go. Why she loses so many eggs along the way and yet enters her childbearing years with vastly more than she will ever need are two of life’s many imponderables”why???“Almost thirty years ago, Zhores Medvedev, a Russian biogerontologist, counted some three hundred serious scientific theories to explain why we age, and the number has not shrunk in the decades since. As Professor José Viña and colleagues from the University of Valencia put it in a summary of current thinking, the theories fall into three broad categories: the genetic mutation theories (your genes malfunction and kill you), the wear-and-tear theories (the body just wears out), and the cellular waste accumulation theories (your cells clog up with toxic by-products). It may be that all three factors work together, or it may be that any two of the above are side effects of the third. Or it may be something else altogether. No one knows.”why we age???INTERESTING FACTS“A successful virus is one that doesn’t kill too well and can circulate widely. That’s what makes flu such a perennial threat. A typical flu renders its victims infectious for about a day before they get symptoms and for about a week after they recover, which turns every victim into a vector. The great Spanish flu of 1918 racked up a global death toll of tens of millions—some estimates put it as high as a hundred million—not by being especially lethal but by being persistent and highly transmissible. It killed only about 2.5 percent of victims, it is thought.”How excruciatingly the history is repeating while we can still do nothing about the present Corona outbreak.“According to one estimate reported by Ed Yong in The Atlantic, the number of viruses in birds and mammals that have the potential to leap the species barrier and infect us may be as high as 800,000. That is a lot of potential danger.”“Women are anatomically different in one other very significant way: they are the sacred keepers of human mitochondria—the vital little powerhouses of our cells. Sperm pass on none of their mitochondria during conception, so all mitochondrial information is transferred from generation to generation through mothers alone. Such a system means that there will be many extinctions along the way. A woman endows all her children with her mitochondria, but only her daughters have the mechanism to pass it onward to future generations. So if a woman has only sons or no children at all—and that happens quite often, of course—her personal mitochondrial line will die with her. All her descendants will still have mitochondria, but it will come from other mothers on other genetic lines. In consequence, the human mitochondrial pool shrinks a little with every generation because of these localized extinctions. Over time, the mitochondrial pool for humans has shrunk so much that, almost unbelievably but rather wonderfully, we are all now descended from a single mitochondrial ancestor—a woman who lived in Africa about 200,000 years ago. You might have heard her referred to as Mitochondrial Eve. She is, in a sense, mother of us all.“you blink fourteen thousand times a day—so much that your eyes are shut for twenty-three minutes of every waking day”“The length of all your blood vessels would take you two and a half times around Earth.”“The most remarkable part of all is your DNA (or deoxyribonucleic acid). You have a meter of it packed into every cell, and so many cells that if you formed all the DNA in your body into a single strand, it would stretch ten billion miles, to beyond Pluto.”“You have about 100,000 microbes per square centimeter of your skin”“Your lungs, smoothed out, would cover a tennis court, and the airways within them would stretch nearly from coast to coast.”“If you put all Earth’s microbes in one heap and all the other animal life in another, the microbe heap would be twenty-five times greater than the animal one”“you have about twenty thousand genes of your own within you, but perhaps as many as twenty million bacterial genes, so from that perspective you are roughly 99 percent bacterial and not quite 1 percent you.”“According to the virologist Dorothy H. Crawford, ocean viruses alone if laid end to end would stretch for ten million light-years, a distance essentially beyond imagining.”“A morsel of cortex one cubic millimeter in size—about the size of a grain of sand—could hold two thousand terabytes of information, enough to store all the movies ever made, trailers included, or about 1.2 billion copies of this book. Altogether, the human brain is estimated to hold something on the order of two hundred exabytes of information, roughly equal to “the entire digital content of today’s world,”“True smiles are brief—between two-thirds of a second and four seconds”“The human eye can distinguish somewhere between 2 million and 7.5 million colors, according to various calculations. Even at the lower end of estimates, that is a lot.”“Although we all have 350 to 400 types of odor receptor, only about half of them are common to all people. That means that we don’t smell the same things”“The heart has no time for distractions. It is the most single-minded thing within you. It has just one job to do, and it does it supremely well: it beats. Slightly more than once every second, about 100,000 times a day, as many as 3.5 billion times in a lifetime, it rhythmically pulses to push blood through your body—and these aren’t gentle thrusts. They are jolts powerful enough to send blood spurting up to three meters if the aorta is severed”“Every hour your heart dispenses around 70 gallons of blood. That’s 1,680 gallons in a day—more gallons pushed through you in a day than you are likely to put in your car in a year”“The journey of blood around your body takes about fifty seconds to complete.”“In the United States, plasma sales make up 1.6 percent of all goods exported, more than America earns from the sale of airplanes.”“Perhaps the most wondrous feature of the liver is its capacity to regenerate. You can remove two-thirds of a liver and it will grow back to its original size in just a few weeks.”“Cartilage is remarkable, too. It is many times smoother than glass: it has a friction coefficient five times less than ice. Imagine playing ice hockey on a surface so smooth that the skaters went sixteen times as fast. That’s cartilage. But unlike ice, it isn’t brittle. It doesn’t crack under pressure as ice would. And you grow it yourself. It’s a living thing.”“An analysis of 655,000 people in 2012 found that being active for just eleven minutes a day after the age of forty yielded 1.8 years of added life expectancy. Being active for an hour or more a day improved life expectancy by 4.2 years.”“As Lieberman noted in The Story of the Human Body, a worker on a factory floor will in a year expend about 175,000 more calories than a desk worker—equivalent to more than sixty marathons”“Every day you produce and consume your own body weight in ATP—some 200 trillion trillion molecules of it.”“Even with the advantage of clothing, shelter, and boundless ingenuity, humans can manage to live on only about 12 percent of Earth’s land area and just 4 percent of the total surface area if you include the seas. It is a sobering thought that 96 percent of our planet is off-limits to us.”“QUIETLY AND RHYTHMICALLY, awake or asleep, generally without thought, every day you breathe in and out about 20,000 times, diligently processing some 4,000 gallons (or 440 cubic feet) of air, depending on how big you are and how active. That’s about 7.3 million breaths between birthdays, 550 million or so over the course of a lifetime.”“In breathing, as in everything in life, the numbers are staggering—indeed fantastical. Every time you breathe, you exhale some 25 sextillion (that’s 2.5 x 1022) molecules of oxygen—so many that with a day’s breathing you will in all likelihood inhale at least one molecule from the breaths of every person who has ever lived. And every person who lives from now until the sun burns out will from time to time breathe in a bit of you.”“The main thing to bear in mind is that carbohydrates, upon being digested, are just more sugar—often quite a lot more. That means that a 150-gram serving of white rice or a small bowl of cornflakes will have the same effect on your blood glucose levels as nine teaspoons of sugar.”“Who would guess, for instance, that an avocado has five times as much saturated fat as a small bag of potato chips? Or that a large latte has more than almost any pastry? Or that coconut oil is almost nothing but saturated fat.”“Heinz ketchup is almost one-quarter sugar. It has more sugar per unit of volume than Coca-Cola.”“Your alimentary canal is about forty feet long if you are an average-sized man, a bit less if you are a woman. The surface area of all that tubing is about half an acre.”“For a man, the average journey time from mouth to anus is fifty-five hours. For a woman, typically, it is more like seventy-two.”“The technical term for gut rumblings is “borborygmi.””“The largest source of foodborne illness is not meat or eggs or mayonnaise, as commonly supposed, but green leafy vegetables. They account for one in five of all food illnesses.”“Two strains of E. coli have more genetic variability than all the mammals on Earth put together”“We shed skin copiously, almost carelessly: some twenty-five thousand flakes a minute, over a million pieces every hour”THE REST of the important excerpts are going to be continued in the comments. And I think I can avoid reading the book again thereby."
328,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75771919-marcos,Rating 5 out of 5,"Packed with information, Bill Bryson's agglomeration of medical discoveries, know-how and historic anecdotes in ""The Body"" absolutely matches his award-winning book ""A Short History of Nearly Everything"". Both are among the best non-fiction on human history. Knowing where we came from and what unimaginable sh*t we did in earlier times is such important knowledge to appreciate how far we came and how good we have it, both materially as medically. And to not go back with ideas like ""curing cancer with urine therapy"". Yes, those and similar spiritual practices still exist ... negating all building blocks and trial & error we went through during millenia, continuing the path of ignorance and human suffering. Both books could be made mandatory during public education.Some sh*t we did in our past:- Hygiene: Not washing your hands before a new surgery, bringing in bacteria from previous patients you treated. This was one of the main causes of death on the surgery table, for a long, long time. Doctors wearing dirty and blooded robes was a sign of ""experience"". The bloodier, the better. In 1900, +50% of the causes of death was by infection. Today it's 3%.- Trepanation: Primitive surgical attempts involving drilling holes into the skull, based on the flawed notion that it would release evil spirits or relieve intracranial pressure.- Bloodletting when ill ""to air out the blood"". Making you actually less able fight the disease. Some people went up to remove 50-75% of the blood from their body.- Blood transfusions: Early attempts at transfusions without proper blood typing and cross-matching, leading to fatal reactions and complications. We also tried blood transfusions from sheep, horses, cows, ... and even direct replacement with water and wine amongst others. Today we're sticking with blood transfusions from humans and that have a similar blood type.- Smallpox inoculation: Initial trials involving the direct application of scabs from infected individuals, which carried a risk of severe infection and disease transmission.- Horrible surgical techniques: Early crude methods of surgery, often resulting in high mortality rates due to infection and lack of anesthesia.- Anesthesia experimentation: Dangerous and unrefined exploration of substances like chloroform and ether for pain relief during surgeries. Today these are used in very specific doses. But it certainly was not always like that.- Organ transplantation: Initial failures and rejection issues due to limited knowledge of immunosuppression and tissue matching.- Electric shock therapy: Uncontrolled and excessive use of electric shocks for mental health treatment, lacking precision and adequate understanding of brain function.- Cancer treatments: Initial crude approaches to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, resulting in severe side effects and limited efficacy.- Brain lobotomy: Initial raw practices to remove brain parts to cure mental health conditions, like depression, shizophrenia, anxiety disorders and even being gay. The procedure was done with an ice pick through your eye, damaging connections in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. Sometimes leaving half of the ice pick behind. Generally lobotomy procedures had significant and irreversible side effects, including personality changes, cognitive impairment, and a general dampening of emotional responsiveness. Most people went to the crazy house. Rather few records were kept on the (non-)effectiveness and most of the surgeries were doing purely random damage. Over time, the use of lobotomy declined as alternative treatments as medications became available.- Etc. Etc. Etc. ..."
329,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/651773-david,Rating 4 out of 5,"Bill Bryson started out writing travel books. Not travel guides, but travelogues - notes on his thoughts as he traveled around, interesting anecdotes, fun random facts about a place. These remain my favorite Bryson books, but I've very much appreciated the turn he's taken in the last couple decades to write ""travel books"" that aren't geographic. A tour through all science in A Short History of Nearly Everything, or through the English language in The Mother Tongue: English and How It Got That Way, or several other topics. And now, the human body.First, a warning to those who are squeamish: it's the human body. All of it. In all its glory, grossness, and all the ways it can go wrong. And the weird and sometimes horrific ways we figured out how it worked. Bryson doesn't linger on the grossness, though there are a handful of anecdotes he appears to take a little more delight in recounting than I really enjoyed.It's overall a good book, though not a great one. It reminds me of the kind of ""scientific"" literature produced in late Roman and early medieval times, by people like Pliny the Elder and Isidore of Seville. A lot of facts, many things intended to pique the reader's interest, but overall superficial and something that would amuse as much as inform.But the benefit of living today, as opposed to in Isidore's day, is that if my curiosity is piqued by something in the book, I can deep dive into the vast amount of more technical literature out there waiting for me.The only thing that really annoys me about the book is that, because Bryson's not an expert in any of this, it's easy for him to say something silly and not catch the error. He's relying on real experts, reading lots himself and interviewing many of the brightest minds in these fields, but some stuff slips through the cracks. He gets particularly bogged down in this idea that “photons of light have no color” (p. 55), which makes literally no sense. He appears to have waded into some philosophical argument that color is epiphenomenal and occurs only in the mind, which is a controversial (and in a physicist's perspective, stupid) argument - but Bryson doesn't appreciate any of the physics or philosophy here, or that it could even be debatable, because he's basing everything on one so-called authority on the topic. On page 127, he explains that blood is red, but appears blue because of ""a quirk of optics"" where ""a higher proportion of the red spectrum is absorbed, but more blue light is bounced back"", which is literally the definition of something being blue. This very same thing comes up later with another sense, when he notes ""none of those flavors or aromas actually exist. All that is really going on in your mouth is texture and chemicals"" (p. 107). As if somehow something that's ""just"" chemicals isn't real? All that's going on in your brain is chemicals!I latch onto these points because it shows the danger of following a non-expert on an intellectual voyage. Like a good but non-expert guide through the wilderness, he can follow the map - but if the map's wrong, he won't know. But overall the book seems good, and you can't deny that Bryson is an entertaining author. I was thinking of giving the book three stars, but... even one of Bryson's less compelling works is better than what most authors could put together."
