    "## Book Recommendation System\n",

    "By Abigail Beasley\n",
    "\n",
    " Despite being the largest social media site dedicated to reading, with millions of active users logging books and book reviews, Goodreads has lagged behind other sites in tailoring recommendations to users based on their interests. My recommendations very rarely seem customized, routinely consisting of what is currently most popular and, worst of all, books I have already read. \n",
    " \n",
    " I got tired of not knowing what to read, so I made my own book recommender. Since using this book recommendation system, I have gotten out of reading rut and my yearly reading has gone up 142% from 38 books in 2023 to 53 books in 2024. Some of my favorite books that I found because of this recommender are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Idiot, Elif Batuman\n",
    "- My Brilliant Friend, Elena Farrente \n",
    "- My Name is Lucy Barton, Elizabeth Strout\n",
    "\n",
    "Because I tend to be quite a moody reader, I wanted to create an item-item recommendation system to allow me to find books similar to a specific book I have read and enjoyed. This book recommender employs a KNN algorithm to find books that are similar based on user ratings. Follow along to see how I did it!"

    "## Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "In preparation, I scraped roughly 1.2M rows of book reviews from Goodreads, resulting in 695k complete reviews from 1,852 users.\n",
    "\n",
    "About the data: In an effort to gather data from like-minded readers, I compiled a list of users by collecting the first 30 reviewers for each book I had read. For all public profiles, I then scraped all their library data. This allowed me to get a list of readers related to me, since we had at least one book in common, but also provided a very large amount of new reading material."

While I could default to the 'book_id' generated by Goodreads, it can be far too specific for a recommendation algorithm. In Goodreads, a 'book id' is tied to an edition or format (e.g. Kindle, Audiobook, Paperback etc.) of each book. For example, in the output below we can see there are 91 different Goodreads book IDs associated with *Jane Eyre*."

    "Most of the books in this dataset have very few ratings. Therefore, calculating an average rating provides little value because the books with the highest and lowest reviews are likely to be books with one very high and low review, respectively. Thus, we are likely to get very strange answers for highest rated books if we rely solely on the traditional mean formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "One potential solution to get a more accurate average for books with few ratings is the Bayesian average. A Bayesian average will rely on preexisting knowledge to form an estimate for the mean, and then update that estimate based on the data available. Below, we can use the average mean for each book as starting point and adjust based on user reviews of the book. The Bayesian average also involves a constant C, which determines how heavily the pior mean estimate will factor into the result. A larger C value means the prior mean will weigh more heavily. For the purposes of this calculation, we will use the average number of ratings a book has as our C value.\n",
